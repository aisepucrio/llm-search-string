abstract = {The planning, realization, and release of a Software Product Line (SPL) are driven by features. Therefore, many high-level decisions about the evolution of an SPL are made at the feature level. However, a feature can involve many stakeholders with different expertise, and taking their opinions into account to make the right decisions is not trivial. In this paper, we propose using belief uncertainty in conjunction with feature models to assist in the evolution of SPLs by explicitly quantifying opinions. We outline three evolution scenarios in which subjective logic can be used to represent the opinions of stakeholders and explain in detail how to use subjective logic to make decisions in the context of the next release problem. We illustrate our ideas with a Smartwatch SPL. Finally, we discuss different ways of combining the opinions of stakeholders depending on the situation, the goals and the risks that can be assumed.},

abstract = {The engineering of a Software Product Line (SPL), either by creating it from scratch or through the re-engineering of existing variants, it uses to be a project that spans several years with a high investment. It is often hard to analyse and quantify this investment, especially in the context of extractive SPL adoption when the related software variants are independently created by different developers following different system architectures and implementation conventions. This paper reports an experience on the creation of an SPL by re-engineering system variants implemented around an educational game called Robocode. The objective of this game is to program a bot (a battle tank) that battles against the bots of other developers. The world-wide Robocode community creates and maintains a large base of knowledge and implementations that are mainly organized in terms of features, although not presented as an SPL. Therefore, a group of master students analysed this variability-rich domain and extracted a Robocode SPL. We present the results of such extraction augmented with an analysis and a quantification regarding the spent time and effort. We believe that the results and the a-posteriori analysis can provide insights on global challenges on SPL adoption. We also provide all the elements to SPL educators to reproduce the teaching activity, and we make available this SPL to be used for any research purpose.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineers put a lot of effort to ensure that, through the setting of a large number of possible configuration options, products are acceptable and well-tailored to customers' needs. Unfortunately, options and their mutual interactions create a huge configuration space which is intractable to exhaustively explore. Instead of testing all products, machine learning is increasingly employed to approximate the set of acceptable products out of a small training sample of configurations. Machine learning (ML) techniques can refine a software product line through learned constraints and a priori prevent non-acceptable products to be derived. In this paper, we use adversarial ML techniques to generate adversarial configurations fooling ML classifiers and pinpoint incorrect classifications of products (videos) derived from an industrial video generator. Our attacks yield (up to) a 100% misclassification rate and a drop in accuracy of 5%. We discuss the implications these results have on SPL quality assurance.},

abstract = {Along the last decade, several studies considered green software design as a key development concern to improve the energy efficiency of software. Yet, few techniques address this concern for Software Product Lines (SPL). In this paper, we therefore introduce two approaches to measure and reduce the energy consumption of a SPL by analyzing a limited set of products sampled from this SPL. While the first approach relies on the analysis of individual feature consumptions, the second one takes feature interactions into account to better mitigate energy consumption of resulting products.Our experimental results on a real-world SPL indicate that both approaches succeed to produce significant energy improvements on a large number of products, while consumption data was modeled from a small set of sampled products. Furthermore, we show that taking feature interactions into account leads to more products improved with higher energy savings per product.},

abstract = {In Machine Learning (ML), the resolution of anomaly detection problems in time series presents a great diversity of practices as it can correspond to many different contexts. These practices cover both grasping the business problem and designing the solution itself. By practice, we designate explicit and implicit steps toward resolving a problem, while a solution corresponds to a combination of algorithms selected for their performance on a given problem. Two related issues arise. The first one is that the practices are individual and not explicitly mutualized. The second one is that choosing one solution over another is all the more difficult to justify because the space of solutions and the evaluation criteria are vast and evolve rapidly with the advances in ML. To solve these issues and tame the evolving diversity in ML, a Software Product Line (SPL) approach can be envisaged to represent the variable set of solutions. However, this requires characterizing an ML business problem through an explicit set of criteria and justifying one ML solution over all others. The resolution of anomaly detection problems is thus different from finding the best configuration workflow from past configurations but lies more in guiding the configuration towards a solution that may never have been studied before. This paper proposes an SPL approach that capitalizes on past practices by exploiting a variability-aware representation to detect new criteria and constraints when practices adopt different solutions to seemingly similar problems. We report on the evaluation of our approach using a set of applications from the literature and an ML software company. We show how the analysis of practices makes it possible to consolidate the knowledge contained in the SPL.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) Engineering relies on explicitly documenting and managing variability information, typically in variability models such as feature models, and relating them with reusable artifacts, e.g., software components. Many companies still rely on clone-and-own reuse approaches and could benefit from adopting an SPL approach instead. However, extracting variability information from existing systems is often challenging due to their size and complexity. Also, manually creating and maintaining variability models and relating them with reusable artifacts is very expensive and requires expert knowledge. To address this problem, SPL reverse-engineering approaches try to automatically extract variability information from existing systems to populate variability models with it. Unfortunately, many existing approaches are limited to a single artifact type and only a few more widely applicable methods have been proposed. In this short paper, we present our vision of a flexible, extensible and artifact-independent approach, which provides a framework for users to mine the variability of their existing system variants and automatically reverse-engineer SPLs. We discuss challenges and give an overview of a possible architecture as well as the steps necessary to realize our approach.},

abstract = {Variability intensive systems may include several thousand features allowing for an enormous number of possible configurations, including wrong ones (e.g. the derived product does not compile). For years, engineers have been using constraints to a priori restrict the space of possible configurations, i.e. to exclude configurations that would violate these constraints. The challenge is to find the set of constraints that would be both precise (allow all correct configurations) and complete (never allow a wrong configuration with respect to some oracle). In this paper, we propose the use of a machine learning approach to infer such product-line constraints from an oracle that is able to assess whether a given product is correct. We propose to randomly generate products from the product line, keeping for each of them its resolution model. Then we classify these products according to the oracle, and use their resolution models to infer cross-tree constraints over the product-line. We validate our approach on a product-line video generator, using a simple computer vision algorithm as an oracle. We show that an interesting set of cross-tree constraint can be generated, with reasonable precision and recall.},

abstract = {Variability management is crucial for companies that need to offer multiple product variants quickly. However, the increasing complexity of software-intensive systems has made variability management increasingly challenging. This challenge is compounded by the need for such systems to run continuously and adapt to changes in the environment and user needs at runtime. To address this challenge, Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL) Engineering has emerged as a strategy for managing variability in complex and dynamic environments. The key challenge in DSPL engineering is to manage product configurations at runtime by detecting changes in the context and adapting accordingly. In this paper, we propose an adaptation mechanism for DSPL feature models that supports dynamic variability and is based on the MAPE-K model. The mechanism transforms feature model constraints into rules that enable the activation of each feature and annotates contexts in the corresponding features to be activated when changes occur. We have implemented the mechanism in the DyMMer 2.0 modeling tool and evaluated its performance using various DSPL feature models. Additionally, we performed a preliminary evaluation with a proof-of-concept study with an expert to assess its practical usage. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed mechanism in managing variability in complex and dynamic environments.},

abstract = {Feature models are widely used for specifying the valid configurations of product lines. Many automated analyses on feature models have been considered, but they often depend on computationally complex algorithms (e.g., solving satisfiability problems). To identify and develop efficient reasoning engines, it is necessary to compare their performance on practically relevant feature models. However, empirical evaluations on feature-model analysis often suffer from the limitations of available feature-model datasets in terms of transferability. A major problem is the accessibility of relevant feature models as they are scattered over numerous publications. In this work, we perform a literature survey on empirical evaluations that target the performance of feature-model analyses to examine common evaluation practices and collect feature models for future evaluations. Furthermore, we examine the suitability of the derived collection for benchmarking performance. To improve accessibility, we provide a repository including all 2,518 identified feature models from 13 application domains, such as system software.},

abstract = {Today's adaptive software systems (i) are often highly configurable product lines, exhibiting hundreds of potentially conflicting configuration options; (ii) are context dependent, forcing the system to reconfigure to ever-changing contextual situations at runtime; (iii) need to fulfill context-dependent performance goals by optimizing measurable nonfunctional properties. Usually, a large number of consistent configurations exists for a given context, and each consistent configuration may perform differently with regard to the current context and performance goal(s). Therefore, it is crucial to consider nonfunctional properties for identifying an appropriate configuration. Existing black-box approaches for estimating the performance of configurations provide no means for determining context-sensitive reconfiguration decisions at runtime that are both consistent and optimal, and hardly allow for combining multiple context-dependent quality goals. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach based on Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) for obtaining consistent and optimal reconfiguration decisions. We use training data obtained from simulations to learn performance-influence models. A novel integrated runtime representation captures both consistency properties and the learned performance-influence models. Our solution provides the flexibility to define multiple context-dependent performance goals. We have implemented our approach as a standalone component. Based on an Internet-of-Things case study using adaptive wireless sensor networks, we evaluate our approach with regard to effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability.},

Variability models document the valid relationships between features and their mapping to artifacts. However, research has shown inconsistencies between the variability of variants in features and artifacts, with negative effects on system safety and development effort. To analyze this mismatch in variability, the causal relationships between features, artifacts, and variants must be uncovered, which has only been addressed to a limited extent. In this paper, we propose taxonomy graphs as novel variability models that reflect the composition of variants from artifacts and features, making mismatches in variability explicit. Our evaluation with two SPL case studies demonstrates the usefulness of our variability model and shows that mismatches in variability can vary significantly in detail and severity.},

However, the existence of these constraints increases the complexity of reasoning about feature models, both for using SAT solvers or compiling the model to a binary decision diagram for efficient analyses. Although some works have tried to refactor constraints to eliminate them, they deal only with simple constraints (i.e., requires and excludes) or require the introduction of an additional set of features, increasing the complexity of the resulting feature model. This paper presents an approach that eliminates all the cross-tree constraints present in regular boolean feature models, including arbitrary constraints, in propositional logic formulas. Our approach for removing constraints consists of splitting the semantics of feature models into orthogonal disjoint feature subtrees, which are then analyzed in parallel to alleviate the exponential blow-up in memory of the resulting feature tree.},

abstract = {Dynamic software product lines demand self-adaptation of their behavior to deal with runtime contextual changes in their environment and offer a personalized product to the user. However, taking user preferences and context into account impedes the manual configuration process, and thus, an efficient and automated procedure is required. To automate the configuration process, context-aware recommendation techniques have been acknowledged as an effective mean to provide suggestions to a user based on their recognized context. In this work, we propose a collaborative filtering method based on tensor factorization that allows an integration of contextual data by modeling an N-dimensional tensor User-Feature-Context instead of the traditional two-dimensional User-Feature matrix. In the proposed approach, different types of non-functional properties are considered as additional contextual dimensions. Moreover, we show how to self-configure software product lines by applying our N-dimensional tensor factorization recommendation approach. We evaluate our approach by means of an empirical study using two datasets of configurations derived for medium-sized product lines. Our results reveal significant improvements in the predictive accuracy of the configuration over a state-of-the-art non-contextual matrix factorization approach. Moreover, it can scale up to a 7-dimensional tensor containing hundred of configurations in a couple of milliseconds.},

abstract = {Ideally, a variability model is a correct and complete representation of product line features and constraints among them. Together with a mapping between features and code, this ensures that only valid products can be configured and derived. However, in practice the modeled constraints might be neither complete nor correct, which causes problems in the configuration and product derivation phases. This paper presents an approach to reverse engineer variability constraints from the implementation, and thus improve the correctness and completeness of variability models.We extended the concept of feature effect analysis [22] to extract variability constraints from code artifacts of the Bosch PS-EC large-scale product line. We present an industrial application of the approach and discuss its required modifications to handle non-Boolean variability and heterogeneous artifact types.},

abstract = {Although Software Product Lines are recurrently praised as an efficient paradigm for systematic reuse, practical adoption remains challenging. For bottom-up Software Product Line adoption, where a set of artefact variants already exists, practitioners lack end-to-end support for chaining (1) feature identification, (2) feature location, (3) feature constraints discovery, as well as (4) reengineering approaches. This challenge can be overcome if there exists a set of principles for building a framework to integrate various algorithms and to support different artefact types. In this paper, we propose the principles of such a framework and we provide insights on how it can be extended with adapters, algorithms and visualisations enabling their use in different scenarios. We describe its realization in BUT4Reuse (Bottom--Up Technologies for Reuse) and we assess its generic and extensible properties by implementing a variety of extensions. We further empirically assess the complexity of integration by reproducing case studies from the literature. Finally, we present an experiment where users realize a bottom-up Software Product Line adoption building on the case study of Eclipse variants.},

abstract = {Modern software systems must fulfill the needs of an ever-growing customer base. Due to the innate diversity of human needs, software should be highly customizable and reconfigurable. Researchers and practitioners gained interest in software product lines (SPL), mimicking aspects of product lines in industrial production for the engineering of highly-variable systems. There are two main approaches towards the engineering of SPLs. The first uses macros---such as the #ifdef macro in C. The second---called feature-oriented programming (FOP)---uses variability-aware preprocessors called composers to generate a program variant from a set of features and a configuration. Both approaches have disadvantages. Most notably, these approaches are usually not supported by the base language; for instance Java is one of the most commonly used FOP languages among researchers, but it does not support macros rather it relies on the C preprocessor or a custom one to translate macros into actual Java code. As a result, developers must struggle to keep up with the evolution of the base language, hindering the general applicability of SPL engineering. Moreover, to effectively evolve a software configuration and its features, their location must be known. The problem of recording and maintaining traceability information is considered expensive and error-prone and it is once again handled externally through dedicated modeling languages and tools. Instead, to properly convey the FOP paradigm, software features should be treated as first-class citizens using concepts that are proper to the host language, so that the variability can be expressed and analyzed with the same tools used to develop any other software in the same language. In this paper, we present a simple and flexible design pattern for JVM-based languages---dubbed devise pattern---that can be used to express feature dependencies and behaviors with a light-weight syntax both at domain analysis and at domain implementation level. To showcase the qualities and feasibility of our approach, we present several variability-aware implementations of a MNIST-encoder---including one using the devise pattern---and compare strengths and weaknesses of each approach.},

MetricHaven fills this gap, as it extensively supports combining information from code files and variability models. Further, we also enable the combination of well established single system metrics with novel variability-aware metrics, going beyond existing variability-aware metrics. Our tool supports most prominent single system and variability-aware code metrics. We provide configuration support for already implemented metrics, resulting in 23,342 metric variations.

abstract = {Behavioral models are the key enablers for behavioral analysis of Software Product Lines (SPL), including testing and model checking. Active model learning comes to the rescue when family behavioral models are non-existent or outdated. A key challenge on active model learning is to detect commonalities and variability efficiently and combine them into concise family models. Benchmarks and their associated metrics will play a key role in shaping the research agenda in this promising field and provide an effective means for comparing and identifying relative strengths and weaknesses in the forthcoming techniques. In this challenge, we seek benchmarks to evaluate the efficiency (e.g., learning time and memory footprint) and effectiveness (e.g., conciseness and accuracy of family models) of active model learning methods in the software product line context. These benchmark sets must contain the structural and behavioral variability models of at least one SPL. Each SPL in a benchmark must contain products that requires more than one round of model learning with respect to the basic active learning L* algorithm. Alternatively, tools supporting the synthesis of artificial benchmark models are also welcome.},

abstract = {One key challenge for software product lines is efficiently managing variability throughout their lifecycle. In this paper, we address the problem of variability in software product lines testing. We (1) identify a set of issues that must be addressed to make software product line testing work in practice and (2) provide a framework that combines a set of techniques to solve these issues. The framework integrates feature modelling, combinatorial interaction testing and constraint programming techniques. First, we extract variability in a software product line as a feature model with specified feature interdependencies. We then employ an algorithm that generates a minimal set of valid test cases covering all 2-way feature interactions for a given time interval. Furthermore, we evaluate the framework on an industrial SPL and show that using the framework saves time and provides better test coverage. In particular, our experiments show that the framework improves industrial testing practice in terms of (i) 17% smaller set of test cases that are (a) valid and (b) guarantee all 2-way feature coverage (as opposite to 19.2% 2-way feature coverage in the hand made test set), and (ii) full flexibility and adjustment of test generation to available testing time.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is a technique to model the variability of configurable systems. When working with feature models, it is possible to analyze them, for instance, by counting the number of valid configurations, searching feature model anomalies, or creating samples of configurations for testing. Classical feature model analysis techniques are based on solving algorithmic problems such as boolean satisfiability, satisfiability modulo theories, or integer linear programming. Existing analysis approaches provide satisfactory solutions for small and medium-sized problem instances, but scaling issues are observed for large-sized feature models. Quantum computers provide up to superpolynomial speedups for specific algorithmic problems and have the potential to solve those scaling issues. This paper analyzes the algorithmic techniques used in classical product line analysis and identifies potentials and challenges for quantum speedups. Our findings show that quantum algorithms like QAOA and Grover have the potential to speed up SAT and ILP-based feature model analysis techniques, but only after additional improvements in quantum hardware have been made.},

They provide a visual abstraction of the variation points in a family of related software products. FMs can be manually created by domain experts or extracted (semi-) automatically from textual documents such as product descriptions or requirements specifications. Nevertheless, there is no way to measure the accuracy of a FM with respect to the information described in the source documents. This paper proposes a method to quantify and visualize whether the elements in a FM (features and relationships) conform to the information available in a set of specification documents. Both the correctness (choice of representative elements) and completeness (no missing elements) of the FM are considered. Designers can use this feedback to fix defects in the FM or to detect incomplete or inconsistent information in the source documents.},

abstract = {Feature models are the "de facto" standard for representing variability in software-intensive systems. Automated analysis of feature models is the computer-aided extraction of information of feature models and is used in testing, maintenance, configuration, and derivation, among other tasks. Testing the analyses of feature models often requires relying on a large number of models that are as realistic as possible. There exist different proposals to generate synthetic feature models using random techniques or metamorphic relations; however, the existing methods do not take into account the semantics of the concepts of the domain that are being represented and the interrelations between them, leading to less realistic feature models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Codex or GPT-3, to generate realistic feature models that preserve semantic coherence while maintaining syntactic validity. The approach automatically generates instances of feature models from a given domain. Concretely, two language models were used, first OpenAI's Codex to generate new instances of feature models using the Universal Variability Language (UVL) syntax and then Cohere's semantic analysis to verify if the newly introduced concepts are from the same domain. This approach enabled the generation of 90% of valid instances according to the UVL syntax. In addition, the valid models score well on model complexity metrics, and the generated features mirror the domain of the original UVL instance used as prompts. With this work, we envision a new thread of research where variability is generated and analyzed using LLMs. This opens the door for a new generation of techniques and tools for variability management.},

BURST takes as inputs a sampling tool, a set of feature models and a sampling budget. It automatically translates any feature model of the set in DIMACS and invokes the sampling tool to generate the budgeted number of samples. To evaluate the scalability of the sampling tool, BURST measures the time the tool needs to produce the requested sample. To evaluate the uniformity of the produced sample, BURST integrates the state-of-the-art and proven statistical test Barbarik. We envision BURST to become the starting point of a standardisation initiative of sampling tool evaluation.

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are used for representing a variety of highly configurable systems or families of systems. They are commonly represented by feature models (FMs). Starting from FMs, configurations, used as test cases, can be generated to identify the products of interest for further activities. As the other types of software, SPLs and their FMs may evolve due to changing requirements or bug-fixing. However, no guidance is usually given on what to do with derived configurations when an FM evolves. The common approach is based on generating all configurations from scratch, which is not optimal since a greater effort is required for concretizing the new tests, and some of the old ones may be still applicable.In this paper, we present the use of a technique for generating combinatorial tests for evolving feature models: this technique incrementally builds the new combinatorial configuration set starting from the one generated from the previous model. Furthermore, we present a novel definition of dissimilarity among configuration sets that can be used to evaluate how much an evolved test suite differs from the previous one and thus allows evaluating the effort required for adapting old test cases to the new ones.Our experiments confirm that using the proposed technique, in general, leads to lower dissimilarity and test suite size w.r.t. the generation of tests from scratch.},

abstract = {This PhD project aims to automatically learn transition systems capturing the behaviour of a whole family of software-based systems. Reasoning at the family level yields important economies of scale and quality improvements for a broad range of systems such as software product lines, adaptive and configurable systems. Yet, to fully benefit from the above advantages, a model of the system family's behaviour is necessary. Such a model is often prohibitively expensive to create manually due to the number of variants. For large long-lived systems with outdated specifications or for systems that continuously adapt, the modelling cost is even higher. Therefore, this PhD proposes to automate the learning of such models from existing artefacts. To advance research at a fundamental level, our learning target are Featured Transition Systems (FTS), an abstract formalism that can be used to provide a pivot semantics to a range of variability-aware state-based modelling languages. The main research questions addressed by this PhD project are: (1) Can we learn variability-aware models efficiently? (2) Can we learn FTS in a black-box fashion? (i.e., with access to execution logs but not to source code); (3) Can we learn FTS in a white/grey-box testing fashion? (i.e., with access to source code); and (4) How do the proposed techniques scale in practice?},

In most of the cases, the assumption in feature model configuration is that single users/stakeholders are interacting with the underlying configurator. However, there are many scenarios where multiple stakeholders need to jointly complete a configuration task, for example, when selecting the features to be included in a company-wide software service or when deciding about the software features to be included in upcoming releases. In such cases, decisions have to be taken jointly where the constraints and preferences of individual stakeholders have to be taken into account.

abstract = {The colossal solution spaces of most configurable systems make intractable their exhaustive exploration. Accordingly, relevant analyses remain open research problems. There exist analyses alternatives such as SAT solving or constraint programming. However, none of them have explored simulation-based methods. Monte Carlo-based decision making is a simulation-based method for dealing with colossal solution spaces using randomness. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that tackles various of those analyses using Monte Carlo methods, which have proven to succeed in vast search spaces (e.g., game theory). Our general framework is described formally, and its flexibility to cope with a diversity of analysis problems is discussed (e.g., finding defective configurations, feature model reverse engineering or getting optimal performance configurations). Additionally, we present a Python implementation of the framework that shows the feasibility of our proposal. With this contribution, we envision that different problems can be addressed using Monte Carlo simulations and that our framework can be used to advance the state of the art a step forward.},

abstract = {Feature and variability extraction from different artifacts is an indispensable activity to support systematic integration of single software systems and Software Product Line (SPL). Beyond manually extracting variability, a variety of approaches, such as feature location in source code and feature extraction in requirements, has been proposed to provide an automatic identification of features and their variation points. Compared with source code, requirements contain more complete variability information and provide traceability links to other artifacts from early development phases. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically extract features and relationships based on a probabilistic relevance and word embedding. In particular, our technique consists of three steps: First, we apply word2vec to obtain a prediction model, which we use to determine the word level similarity of requirements. Second, based on word level similarity and the significance of a word in a domain, we compute the requirements level similarity using probabilistic relevance. Third, we adopt hierarchical clustering to group features and we define four criteria to detect variation points between identified features. We perform a case study to evaluate the usability and robustness of our method and to compare it with the results of other related approaches. Initial results reveal that our approach identifies the majority of features correctly and also extracts variability information with reasonable accuracy.},

An open question is how a feature model can be inductively learned in an automated way from a limited number of given product specifications in terms of features.We propose to address this problem through machine learning, more precisely inductive generalization from examples. However, no counter-examples are assumed to exist. Basically, a feature model needs to be complete with respect to all the given example specifications.

abstract = {The proper configuration of systems has become a fundamental factor to avoid cybersecurity risks. Thereby, the analysis of cybersecurity vulnerabilities is a mandatory task, but the number of vulnerabilities and system configurations that can be threatened is extremely high. In this paper, we propose a method that uses software product line techniques to analyse the vulnerable configuration of the systems. We propose a solution, entitled AMADEUS, to enable and support the automatic analysis and testing of cybersecurity vulnerabilities of configuration systems based on feature models. AMADEUS is a holistic solution that is able to automate the analysis of the specific infrastructures in the organisations, the existing vulnerabilities, and the possible configurations extracted from the vulnerability repositories. By using this information, AMADEUS generates automatically the feature models, that are used for reasoning capabilities to extract knowledge, such as to determine attack vectors with certain features. AMADEUS has been validated by demonstrating the capacities of feature models to support the threat scenario, in which a wide variety of vulnerabilities extracted from a real repository are involved. Furthermore, we open the door to new applications where software product line engineering and cybersecurity can be empowered.},

abstract = {Variability models are used to build configurators. Configurators are programs that guide users through the configuration process to reach a desired configuration that fulfils user requirements. The same variability model can be used to design different configurators employing different techniques. One of the elements that can change in a configurator is the configuration workflow, i.e., the order and sequence in which the different configuration elements are presented to the configuration stakeholders. When developing a configurator, a challenge is to decide the configuration workflow that better suites stakeholders according to previous configurations. For example, when configuring a Linux distribution, the configuration process start by choosing the network or the graphic card, and then other packages with respect to a given sequence. In this paper, we present COnfiguration workfLOw proceSS mIning (COLOSSI), an automated technique that given a set of logs of previous configurations and a variability model can automatically assist to determine the configuration workflow that better fits the configuration logs generated by user activities. The technique is based on process discovery, commonly used in the process mining area, with an adaptation to configuration contexts. Our proposal is validated using existing data from an ERP configuration environment showing its feasibility. Furthermore, we open the door to new applications of process mining techniques in different areas of software product line engineering.},

Software-Defined Networks (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) offer the possibility of using software to manage computer and mobile networks and build novel Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) deployed in heterogeneous devices. To reason about the variability of network functions and especially about the quality of a software product defined as a set of VNFs instantiated as part of a service (i.e., Service Function Chaining), a variability model along with a quality model is required.However, this domain imposes certain challenges to quality-aware reasoning of service function chains, such as numerical features or configuration-level Quality Attributes (QAs) (e.g., energy consumption). Incorporating numerical reasoning with quality data into SPL analyses is challenging and tool support is rare. In this work, we present 3 groups of operations: model report, aggregate functions to dynamically convert QAs at the feature-level into the configuration-level, and quality-aware optimisation. Our objective is to test the most complete reasoning tools to exploit the extended variability with quality attributes needed for VNFs.},

These features can be reused to customize a product to satisfy specific needs of certain customers or markets. As the number of possible products increases exponentially for new features, testing all products is infeasible. Existing testing approaches reduce their effort by restricting the number of products (sampling) and improve their effectiveness by considering the order of tests (prioritization). In this paper, we propose a cluster-based prioritization technique to sample similar products with respect to the feature selection. We evaluate our approach using feature models of different sizes and show that cluster-based prioritization can enhance the effectiveness of product-line testing.},

abstract = {Today’s competitive marketplace requires the industry to understand unique and particular needs of their customers. Product line practices enable companies to create individual products for every customer by providing an interdependent set of features. Users configure personalized products by consecutively selecting desired features based on their individual needs. However, as most features are interdependent, users must understand the impact of their gradual selections in order to make valid decisions. Thus, especially when dealing with large feature models, specialized assistance is needed to guide the users in configuring their product. Recently, recommender systems have proved to be an appropriate mean to assist users in finding information and making decisions. In this paper, we propose an advanced feature recommender system that provides personalized recommendations to users. In detail, we offer four main contributions: (i) We provide a recommender system that suggests relevant features to ease the decision-making process. (ii) Based on this system, we provide visual support to users that guides them through the decision-making process and allows them to focus on valid and relevant parts of the configuration space. (iii) We provide an interactive open-source configurator tool encompassing all those features. (iv) In order to demonstrate the performance of our approach, we compare three different recommender algorithms in two real case studies derived from business experience.},

This paper presents simple heuristics that help the Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm (IBEA) in finding sound and optimum configurations of very large variability models in the presence of competing objectives. We employ a combination of static and evolutionary learning of model structure, in addition to utilizing a pre-computed solution used as a "seed" in the midst of a randomly-generated initial population. The seed solution works like a single straw that is enough to break the camel's back -given that it is a feature-rich seed. We show promising results where we can find 30 sound solutions for configuring upward of 6000 features within 30 minutes.},

abstract = {Feature models are commonly used to specify valid configurations of a product line. In industry, feature models are often complex due to numerous features and constraints. Thus, a multitude of automated analyses have been proposed. Many of those rely on computing the number of valid configurations, which typically depends on solving a #SAT problem, a computationally expensive operation. Even worse, most counting-based analyses require evaluation for multiple features or partial configurations resulting in numerous #SAT computations on the same feature model. Instead of repetitive computations on highly similar formulas, we aim to improve the performance by reusing knowledge between these computations. In this work, we are the first to propose reusing d-DNNFs for performing repetitive counting queries on features and partial configurations. In our experiments, reusing d-DNNFs saved up-to  (sim) 99.98% compared to repetitive invocations of #SAT solvers even when including compilation times. Overall, our tool ddnnife combined with the d-DNNF compiler d4 appears to be the most promising option when dealing with many repetitive feature-model counting queries.},

abstract = {Dynamic software product lines (DSPL) constitute a promising approach for developing highly-configurable, runtime-adaptive systems in a feature-oriented way. A DSPL integrates both variability in time and space in a unified conceptual framework. For this, domain features are equipped with additional binding time information to distinguish between static configuration parameters and dynamically (re-) configurable features. Until now, little support exists to specify and validate staged (re-)configuration semantics for DSPLs in a concise way. In this paper, we propose conservative extensions to domain feature models comprising variable feature binding times together with different kinds of binding time constraints. Those extensions are motivated by a real-world industrial case study from the automation engineering domain. Our implementation performs a model transformation into plain feature models treatable by corresponding state-of-the-art analysis tools. We conducted an evaluation of our approach concerning the case study.},

abstract = {Managing dynamic variability has motivated several researchers to combine Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) practices with runtime variability mechanisms. By combining these approaches, a DSPL acquires important features, ranging from the ability to reconfigure by changing the context, adding or removing features, crash recovery, and re-adaptation based on changes in the model’s features. Feature model (FM) is an important artifact of a DPSL and there is a lack of tools that support the modeling of this artifact. We have extended the DyMMer tool for modeling FM of DSPLs from an adaptation mechanism based on MAPE-K to solve this problem. We migrated the DyMMer tool to a web version and incorporated new features: (i) modeling of FMs from SPLs and DSPLs, (ii) development of an adaptation mechanism for FM of DSPLs, (iii) repository of FMs, (iv) inclusion of thresholds for measures, and (v) user authentication. We believe that this tool is useful for research in the area of DSPLs, and also for dynamic domain modeling and evaluation. Video: https://youtu.be/WVHW6bI8ois},

abstract = {Software design is a process of trading off competing objectives. If the user objective space is rich, then we should use optimizers that can fully exploit that richness. For example, this study configures software product lines (expressed as feature maps) using various search-based software engineering methods. As we increase the number of optimization objectives, we find that methods in widespread use (e.g. NSGA-II, SPEA2) perform much worse than IBEA (Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm). IBEA works best since it makes most use of user preference knowledge. Hence it does better on the standard measures (hypervolume and spread) but it also generates far more products with 0% violations of domain constraints. Our conclusion is that we need to change our methods for search-based software engineering, particularly when studying complex decision spaces.},

Automated analyses of feature models, such as consistency checking and interactive or offline product selection, often rely on translating models to propositional logic and using satisfiability (SAT) solvers.Efficiency of individual satisfiability-based analyses has been reported previously. We generalize and quantify these studies with a series of independent experiments. We show that previously reported efficiency is not incidental. Unlike with the general SAT instances, which fall into easy and hard classes, the instances induced by feature modeling are easy throughout the spectrum of realistic models. In particular, the phenomenon of phase transition is not observed for realistic feature models.Our main practical conclusion is a general encouragement for researchers to continued development of SAT-based methods to further exploit this efficiency in future.},

abstract = {Configurable systems often contain components from different fields or disciplines that are relevant for distinct stakeholders. For instance, tests or analyses targeting interactions of the software of a cyber-physical system may be only applicable for software components. However, managing such components in isolation is not trivial due, for instance, interdependencies between features. Feature models are a common formalism to specify such dependencies. Feature-model slicing corresponds to creating a subset of the feature model (e.g., with only components relevant to a particular stakeholder) that still preserves transitive dependencies from discarded features. However, slicing is computationally expensive and subsequent analyses often depend on complex computations, such as SAT or #SAT. With knowledge compilation, the original feature model can be translated to a beneficial format (e.g., d-DNNF or BDD) with an initial effort that accelerates subsequent analyses. Consequentially, acquiring a sliced target format depends on two expensive subsequent algorithms. In this work, we merge both steps by proposing projected d-DNNF compilation; a novel way to slice feature models that coincidently performs knowledge compilation to d-DNNF. Our empirical evaluation on real-world feature models shows that our tool pd4 often reduces runtimes substantially compared to existing techniques and scales to more input instances.},

abstract = {Software systems are becoming increasingly configurable. A paradigmatic example is the Linux kernel, which can be adjusted for a tremendous variety of hardware devices, from mobile phones to supercomputers, thanks to the thousands of configurable features it supports. In principle, many relevant problems on configurable systems, such as completing a partial configuration to get the system instance that consumes the least energy or optimizes any other quality attribute, could be solved through exhaustive analysis of all configurations. However, configuration spaces are typically colossal and cannot be entirely computed in practice. Alternatively, configuration samples can be analyzed to approximate the answers. Generating those samples is not trivial since features usually have inter-dependencies that constrain the configuration space. Therefore, getting a single valid configuration by chance is extremely unlikely. As a result, advanced samplers are being proposed to generate random samples at a reasonable computational cost. However, to date, no sampler can deal with highly configurable complex systems, such as the Linux kernel. This paper proposes a new sampler that does scale for those systems, based on an original theoretical approach called extensible logic groups. The sampler is compared against five other approaches. Results show our tool to be the fastest and most scalable one.},

abstract = {Usually software product variants, developed by clone-and-own approach, form often a starting point for building Software Product Line (SPL). To migrate software products that deemed similar into a product line, it is essential to trace variability among software artifacts because the distinguishing factor between traditional software engineering and software product line engineering is the variability. Variability tracing is used to support conversion from traditional software development into software product line development and automate products derivation process such that core assets can be automatically configured for a product according to the features selection from the feature model. Tracing and maintaining interrelationships between artifacts within a software system also are needed to facilitate program comprehension, make the process of maintaining the system less dependent on individual experts. This paper presents a method based on information retrieval approach namely, latent semantic indexing, to establish traceability links between object-oriented source code of product variants and their feature model as representative of variability model.},

abstract = {The automated analysis of feature models (FM) is based on SAT, BDD, and CSP - known NP-complete problems. Therefore, the analysis could have an exponential worst-case execution time. However, for many practical relevant analysis cases, state-of-the-art (SOTA) analysis tools quite successfully master the problem of exponential worst-case execution time based on heuristics. So far, however, very little is known about the structure of FMs that cause the cases in which the execution time (hardness) for analyzing a given FM increases unpredictably for SOTA analysis tools. In this paper, we propose to use width measures from graph theory to characterize the structural complexity of FMs as a basis for an estimation of the hardness of analysis operations on FMs with SOTA analysis tools. We present an experiment that we use to analyze the reasonability of graph width measures as metric for the structural complexity of FMs and the hardness of FM analysis. Such a complexity metric can be used as a basis for a unified method to systematically improve SOTA analysis tools.},

abstract = {Feature Models (FMs) are used extensively in software product line engineering to help generate and validate individual product configurations and to provide support for domain analysis. As FM construction can be tedious and time-consuming, researchers have previously developed techniques for extracting FMs from sets of formally specified individual configurations, or from software requirements specifications for families of existing products. However, such artifacts are often not available. In this paper we present a novel, automated approach for constructing FMs from publicly available product descriptions found in online product repositories and marketing websites such as SoftPedia and CNET. While each individual product description provides only a partial view of features in the domain, a large set of descriptions can provide fairly comprehensive coverage. Our approach utilizes hundreds of partial product descriptions to construct an FM and is described and evaluated against antivirus product descriptions mined from SoftPedia.},

abstract = {Deep learning libraries provide vast APIs because of the multitude of supported input data types, pre-processing operations, and neural network types and configuration options. However, developers working on one concrete application typically use only a small subset of the API at any one given time. Newcomers hence have to read through tutorials and API documentation, gathering scattered information, trying to find the API that fits their needs. This is time consuming and error prone. To remedy this, we show how we modularized the API of a popular Java DL framework Deeplearning4j (DL4J) according to features. Beginner developers can interactively select desired high level features, and our tool generates the subset of the DL library API that corresponds to the selected features. We evaluate our modularization on DL4J code samples, demonstrating an average recall of 98.9% for API classes and 98.0% for API methods. The respective precision is 19.3% and 13.8%, which represents an improvement of two orders of magnitude compared to the complete DL4J API.},

abstract = {Many modern software systems continuously reconfigure themselves to (self-)adapt to ever-changing environmental contexts. Selecting presumably best-fitting next configurations is, however, very challenging, depending on functional and non-functional criteria like real-time constraints as well as inherently uncertain future contexts which makes greedy one-step decision heuristics ineffective. In addition, the computational overhead caused by reconfiguration planning at run-time should not outweigh its benefits. On the other hand, completely pre-planning reconfiguration decisions at design time is also infeasible due to the lack of knowledge about the context behavior. In this paper, we propose a game-theoretic setting for precomputing reconfiguration decisions under partially uncertain real-time behavior. We employ stochastic timed game automata as reconfiguration model to derive winning strategies which enable the first player (the system) to make fast look-ups for presumably best-fitting reconfiguration decisions satisfying the second player (the context). To cope with the high computational complexity of finding winning strategies, our tool implementation1 utilizes the statistical model-checker Uppaal Stratego to approximate near-optimal solutions. In our evaluation, we investigate efficiency/effectiveness trade-offs by considering a real-world example consisting of a reconfigurable robot support system for the construction of aircraft fuselages.},

Currently, most of existing malware detection solutions are individually proposed to address certain types of attacks or certain evasion techniques. Thus, it is desired to conduct a systematic investigation and evaluation of anti-malware solutions and tools based on different attacks and evasion techniques. In this paper, we first propose a meta model for Android malware to capture the common attack features and evasion features in the malware. Based on this model, we develop a framework, MYSTIQUE, to automatically generate malware covering four attack features and two evasion features, by adopting the software product line engineering approach. With the help of MYSTIQUE, we conduct experiments to 1) understand Android malware and the associated attack features as well as evasion techniques; 2) evaluate and compare the 57 off-the-shelf anti-malware tools, 9 academic solutions and 4 App market vetting processes in terms of accuracy in detecting attack features and capability in addressing evasion. Last but not least, we provide a benchmark of Android malware with proper labeling of contained attack and evasion features.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Data-Driven Search-based Software Engineering (DSE), which combines insights from Mining Software Repositories (MSR) and Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE). While MSR formulates software engineering problems as data mining problems, SBSE reformulate Software Engineering (SE) problems as optimization problems and use meta-heuristic algorithms to solve them. Both MSR and SBSE share the common goal of providing insights to improve software engineering. The algorithms used in these two areas also have intrinsic relationships. We, therefore, argue that combining these two fields is useful for situations (a) which require learning from a large data source or (b) when optimizers need to know the lay of the land to find better solutions, faster.This paper aims to answer the following three questions: (1) What are the various topics addressed by DSE?, (2) What types of data are used by the researchers in this area?, and (3) What research approaches do researchers use? The paper briefly sets out to act as a practical guide to develop new DSE techniques and also to serve as a teaching resource.This paper also presents a resource (tiny.cc/data-se) for exploring DSE. The resource contains 89 artifacts which are related to DSE, divided into 13 groups such as requirements engineering, software product lines, software processes. All the materials in this repository have been used in recent software engineering papers; i.e., for all this material, there exist baseline results against which researchers can comparatively assess their new ideas.},

It gets increasingly more challenging with industrial-size models containing hundreds or thousands of features and constraints. Each change may lead to anomalies in the feature model such as making some features impossible to select. While the detection of anomalies is well-researched, giving explanations is still a challenge. Explanations must be as accurate and understandable as possible to support the developer in repairing the source of an error. We propose an efficient and generic algorithm for explaining different anomalies in feature models. Additionally, we achieve a benefit for the developer by computing short explanations expressed in a user-friendly manner and by emphasizing specific parts in explanations that are more likely to be the cause of an anomaly. We provide an open-source implementation in FeatureIDE and show its scalability for industrial-size feature models.},

A crucial step in this challenge is to reverse engineer feature models that capture all the required feature combinations of each system variant. Current research has explored this task using propositional logic, natural language, and search-based techniques. However, using knowledge from the implementation artifacts for the reverse engineering task has not been studied. We propose a multi-objective approach that not only uses standard precision and recall metrics for the combinations of features but that also considers variability-safety, i.e. the property that, based on structural dependencies among elements of implementation artifacts, asserts whether all feature combinations of a feature model are in fact well-formed software systems.

Users simply have to annotate LATEX source files with variability information, e.g., (de)activating portions of text, tuning figures' sizes, or tweaking line spacing. Then, a fully automated procedure learns constraints among Boolean and numerical values for avoiding non-acceptable paper variants, and finally, users can further configure their papers (e.g., aesthetic considerations) or pick a (random) paper variant that meets constraints, e.g., page limits.

abstract = {In this paper, we report on our experience on the development of La Hilandera, an e-commerce site selling haberdashery products and craft supplies in Europe. The store has a huge input space where customers can place almost three millions of different orders which made testing an extremely difficult task. To address the challenge, we explored the applicability of some of the practices for variability management in software product lines. First, we used a feature model to represent the store input space which provided us with a variability view easy to understand, share and discuss with all the stakeholders. Second, we used techniques for the automated analysis of feature models for the detection and repair of inconsistent and missing configuration settings. Finally, we used test selection and prioritization techniques for the generation of a manageable and effective set of test cases. Our findings, summarized in a set of lessons learnt, suggest that variability techniques could successfully address many of the challenges found when developing e-commerce sites.},

abstract = {The manufacturing domain faces new challenges due to market changes. One of these changes affects consumer behavior, i.e. customers demand individualized products in small batches. Varying production requests require different configurations of manufacturing systems. But until today most of these systems are designed for single purpose usage, therefore new manufacturing systems are required. One solution are modular manufacturing systems, which can be composed of diverse modules from different vendors providing varying capabilities [1]. Modular manufacturing systems are re-configurable at two different levels. First, on the system group level, where modules with the required capabilities are selected and orchestrated. Second, on the module level, where a configuration has to be selected that provides the capability with the right manufacturing parameters. To be able to select and orchestrate the modules on the system group level, each module has to provide a self-description, which covers the current configuration [2].},

However, two essential unsolved challenges prevent the practical application of scenario-based testing according to the SOTIF-standard: (1)&nbsp;how to select a set of representative test scenarios, and (2)&nbsp;how to assess the effectiveness of a test scenario suite. In this paper, we leverage variability modelling techniques to select scenarios from a scenario space and assess the resulting scenario suites with a mutation score as metric. We capture the scenario space in a feature model and generate representative subsets with feature-interaction coverage sampling. The mutation score assesses the failure-finding effectiveness of these samples. We evaluate our concepts by sampling scenario suites for two independent Autonomous Emergency Braking function implementations and executing them on an industrial-strength simulator. Our results show that the feature model captures a scenario space that is relevant to identify all mutants. We show that sampling based on interaction coverage reduces the testing effort significantly while maintaining effectiveness in terms of mutation scores. Our results underline the potential of feature model sampling for testing in the automotive industry.},

The method integrates user requirements, particularly accessibility and sensitivity to diversity, into software family development. Utilizing a user model subtree, it allows for customization based on users' needs, constraints, and preferences. A prototypical demonstration is shown through a voice user interface of an assistance robot. Despite an overall satisfying success rate of 96%, results suggest the quality of configuration slightly decreases with an increasing number of user constraints. This innovative approach offers significant potential, especially given the growing need for personalized human-computer interaction in our ageing society. However, it also prompts further research questions, such as its adaptability to non-software family systems and quality of configuration via smart AI models.},

abstract = {Despite its NP-completeness, the Boolean satisfiability problem gave birth to highly efficient tools that are able to find solutions to a Boolean formula and compute their number. Boolean formulae compactly encode huge, constrained search spaces for variability-intensive systems, e.g., the possible configurations of the Linux kernel. These search spaces are generally too big to explore exhaustively, leading most testing approaches to sample a few solutions before analysing them. A desirable property of such samples is uniformity: each solution should get the same selection probability. This property motivated the design of uniform random samplers, relying on SAT solvers and counters and achieving different tradeoffs between uniformity and scalability. Though we can observe their performance in practice, understanding the complexity these tools face and accurately predicting it is an under-explored problem. Indeed, structural metrics such as the number of variables and clauses involved in a formula poorly predict the sampling complexity. More elaborated ones, such as minimal independent support (MIS), are intractable to compute on large formulae. We provide an efficient parallel algorithm to compute a related metric, the number of equivalence classes, and demonstrate that this metric is highly correlated to time and memory usage of uniform random sampling and model counting tools. We explore the role of formula preprocessing on various metrics and show its positive influence on correlations. Relying on these correlations, we train an efficient classifier (F1-score 0.97) to predict whether uniformly sampling a given formula will exceed a specified budget. Our results allow us to characterise the similarities and differences between (uniform) sampling, solving and counting.},

abstract = {In product line engineering, domain analysis is the process of analyzing related products to identify their common and variable features. This process is generally carried out by experts on the basis of existing product descriptions, which are expressed in a more or less structured way. Modeling and reasoning about product descriptions are error-prone and time consuming tasks. Feature models (FMs) constitute popular means to specify product commonalities and variabilities in a compact way, and to provide automated support to the domain analysis process. This paper aims at easing the transition from product descriptions expressed in a tabular format to FMs accurately representing them. This process is parameterized through a dedicated language and high-level directives (e.g., products/features scoping). We guarantee that the resulting FM represents the set of legal feature combinations supported by the considered products and has a readable tree hierarchy together with variability information. We report on our experiments based on public data and characterize the properties of the derived FMs.},

abstract = {Multi-tenancy is a key pillar of cloud services. It allows different users to share computing and virtual resources transparently, meanwhile guaranteeing substantial cost savings. Due to the tradeoff between scalability and customization, one of the major drawbacks of multi-tenancy is limited configurability. Since users may often have conflicting configuration preferences, offering the best user experience is an open challenge for service providers. In addition, the users, their preferences, and the operational environment may change during the service operation, thus jeopardizing the satisfaction of user preferences. In this article, we present an approach to support user-centric adaptation of multi-tenant services. We describe how to engineer the activities of the Monitoring, Analysis, Planning, Execution (MAPE) loop to support user-centric adaptation, and we focus on adaptation analysis. Our analysis computes a service configuration that optimizes user satisfaction, complies with infrastructural constraints, and minimizes reconfiguration obtrusiveness when user- or service-related changes take place. To support our analysis, we model multi-tenant services and user preferences by using feature and preference models, respectively. We illustrate our approach by utilizing different cases of virtual desktops. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the analysis in improving user preferences satisfaction in negligible time.},

abstract = {Feature models are widely used to capture variability, commonalities and configuration rules of software systems. We apply this technique to model component-based systems with many variants during specification, implementation, or run time. This representation allows us to determine the set of valid configurations befitting a given context, especially at run time. A key challenge is to determine the configuration most suitable, especially with respect to non-functional aspects: quality of service, performance, reconfiguration time... We propose an algorithm for selecting the configuration that optimizes a given quality metrics. This algorithm is a variant of the Best-First Search algorithm, a heuristic technique suitable for feature model optimization. The algorithm is parameterized with several strategies and heuristics on feature models leading to different optimality and efficiency properties. We discuss the algorithm, its strategies and heuristics, and we present experimental results showing that the algorithm meets the requirements for our real time systems.},

abstract = {Mobile applications run in environments where the context is continuously changing. Therefore, it is necessary to provide support for the run-time adaptation of these applications. This support is usually achieved by middleware platforms that offer a context-aware dynamic reconfiguration service. However, the main shortcoming of existing approaches is that both the list of possible configurations and the plans to adapt the application to a new configuration are usually specified at design-time. In this paper we present an approach that allows the automatic generation at run-time of application configurations and of reconfiguration plans. Moreover, the generated configurations are optimal regarding the provided functionality and, more importantly, without exceeding the available resources (e.g. battery). This is performed by: (1) having the information about the application variability available at runtime using feature models, and (2) using a genetic algorithm that allows generating an optimal configuration at runtime. We have specified a case study and evaluated our approach, and the results show that it is efficient enough as to be used on mobile devices without introducing an excessive overhead.},
