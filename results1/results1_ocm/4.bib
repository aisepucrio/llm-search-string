abstract = {A key challenge of the development and maintenance of configurable systems is to predict the performance of individual system variants based on the features selected. It is usually infeasible to measure the performance of all possible variants, due to feature combinatorics. Previous approaches predict performance based on small samples of measured variants, but it is still open how to dynamically determine an ideal sample that balances prediction accuracy and measurement effort. In this paper, we adapt two widely-used sampling strategies for performance prediction to the domain of configurable systems and evaluate them in terms of sampling cost, which considers prediction accuracy and measurement effort simultaneously. To generate an initial sample, we introduce a new heuristic based on feature frequencies and compare it to a traditional method based on t-way feature coverage. We conduct experiments on six real-world systems and provide guidelines for stakeholders to predict performance by sampling.},

abstract = {The specialization of the configuration space of a software system has been considered for targeting specific configuration profiles, usages, deployment scenarios, or hardware settings. The challenge is to find constraints among options' values that only retain configurations meeting a performance objective. Since the exponential nature of configurable systems makes a manual specialization unpractical, several approaches have considered its automation using machine learning, i.e., measuring a sample of configurations and then learning what options' values should be constrained. Even focusing on learning techniques based on decision trees for their built-in explainability, there is still a wide range of possible approaches that need to be evaluated, i.e., how accurate is the specialization with regards to sampling size, performance thresholds, and kinds of configurable systems. In this paper, we compare six learning techniques: three variants of decision trees (including a novel algorithm) with and without the use of model-based feature selection. We first perform a study on 8 configurable systems considered in previous related works and show that the accuracy reaches more than 90% and that feature selection can improve the results in the majority of cases. We then perform a study on the Linux kernel and show that these techniques performs as well as on the other systems. Overall, our results show that there is no one-size-fits-all learning variant (though high accuracy can be achieved): we present guidelines and discuss tradeoffs.},

abstract = {Performance is arguably the most crucial attribute that reflects the quality of a configurable software system. However, given the increasing scale and complexity of modern software, modeling and predicting how various configurations can impact performance becomes one of the major challenges in software maintenance. As such, performance is often modeled without having a thorough knowledge of the software system, but relying mainly on data, which fits precisely with the purpose of deep learning. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive review exclusively on the topic of deep learning for performance learning of configurable software, covering 1,206 searched papers spanning six indexing services, based on which 99 primary papers were extracted and analyzed. Our results outline key statistics, taxonomy, strengths, weaknesses, and optimal usage scenarios for techniques related to the preparation of configuration data, the construction of deep learning performance models, the evaluation of these models, and their utilization in various software configuration-related tasks. We also identify the good practices and potentially problematic phenomena from the studies surveyed, together with a comprehensive summary of actionable suggestions and insights into future opportunities within the field.

Features influence functional properties of software systems as well as non-functional ones, such as performance and memory consumption. Researchers have successfully demonstrated the correlation between feature selection and performance. However, the generality of these performance models across different hardware platforms has not yet been evaluated.We propose a technique for enhancing generality of performance models across different hardware environments using linear transformation. Empirical studies on three real-world software systems show that our approach is computationally efficient and can achieve high accuracy (less than 10% mean relative error) when predicting system performance across 23 different hardware platforms. Moreover, we investigate why the approach works by comparing performance distributions of systems and structure of performance models across different platforms.},

abstract = {Context: Many software systems are highly configurable. Different configuration options could lead to varying performances of the system. It is difficult to measure system performance in the presence of an exponential number of possible combinations of these options.Goal: Predicting software performance by using a small configuration sample.Method: This paper proposes Perf-AL to address this problem via adversarial learning. Specifically, we use a generative network combined with several different regularization techniques (L1 regularization, L2 regularization and a dropout technique) to output predicted values as close to the ground truth labels as possible. With the use of adversarial learning, our network identifies and distinguishes the predicted values of the generator network from the ground truth value distribution. The generator and the discriminator compete with each other by refining the prediction model iteratively until its predicted values converge towards the ground truth distribution.Results: We argue that (i) the proposed method can achieve the same level of prediction accuracy, but with a smaller number of training samples. (ii) Our proposed model using seven real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. This help to further promote software configurable performance.Conclusion: Experimental results on seven public real-world datasets demonstrate that PERF-AL outperforms state-of-the-art software performance prediction methods.},

abstract = {Almost every complex software system today is configurable. While configurability has many benefits, it challenges performance prediction, optimization, and debugging. Often, the influences of individual configuration options on performance are unknown. Worse, configuration options may interact, giving rise to a configuration space of possibly exponential size. Addressing this challenge, we propose an approach that derives a performance-influence model for a given configurable system, describing all relevant influences of configuration options and their interactions. Our approach combines machine-learning and sampling heuristics in a novel way. It improves over standard techniques in that it (1) represents influences of options and their interactions explicitly (which eases debugging), (2) smoothly integrates binary and numeric configuration options for the first time, (3) incorporates domain knowledge, if available (which eases learning and increases accuracy), (4) considers complex constraints among options, and (5) systematically reduces the solution space to a tractable size. A series of experiments demonstrates the feasibility of our approach in terms of the accuracy of the models learned as well as the accuracy of the performance predictions one can make with them.},

abstract = {Predicting the performance of highly configurable software systems is the foundation for performance testing and quality assurance. To that end, recent work has been relying on machine/deep learning to model software performance. However, a crucial yet unaddressed challenge is how to cater for the sparsity inherited from the configuration landscape: the influence of configuration options (features) and the distribution of data samples are highly sparse. In this paper, we propose an approach based on the concept of “divide-and-learn”, dubbed DaL. The basic idea is that, to handle sample sparsity, we divide the samples from the configuration landscape into distant divisions, for each of which we build a regularized Deep Neural Network as the local model to deal with the feature sparsity. A newly given configuration would then be assigned to the right model of division for the final prediction. Experiment results from eight real-world systems and five sets of training data reveal that, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, DaL performs no worse than the best counterpart on 33 out of 40 cases (within which 26 cases are significantly better) with up to 1.94\texttimes{} improvement on accuracy; requires fewer samples to reach the same/better accuracy; and producing acceptable training overhead. Practically, DaL also considerably improves different global models when using them as the underlying local models, which further strengthens its flexibility.

abstract = {Many modern software systems are highly configurable, allowing the user to tune them for performance and more. Current performance modeling approaches aim at finding performance-optimal configurations by building performance models in a black-box manner. While these models provide accurate estimates, they cannot pinpoint causes of observed performance behavior to specific code regions. This does not only hinder system understanding, but it also complicates tracing the influence of configuration options to individual methods.We propose a white-box approach that models configuration-dependent performance behavior at the method level. This allows us to predict the influence of configuration decisions on individual methods, supporting system understanding and performance debugging. The approach consists of two steps: First, we use a coarse-grained profiler and learn performance-influence models for all methods, potentially identifying some methods that are highly configuration- and performance-sensitive, causing inaccurate predictions. Second, we re-measure these methods with a fine-grained profiler and learn more accurate models, at higher cost, though. By means of 9 real-world Java software systems, we demonstrate that our approach can efficiently identify configuration-relevant methods and learn accurate performance-influence models.},

abstract = {Understanding the influence of configuration options on performance is key for finding optimal system configurations, system understanding, and performance debugging. In prior research, a number of performance-influence modeling approaches have been proposed, which model a configuration option's influence and a configuration's performance as a scalar value. However, these point estimates falsely imply a certainty regarding an option's influence that neglects several sources of uncertainty within the assessment process, such as (1) measurement bias, (2) model representation and learning process, and (3) incomplete data. This leads to the situation that different approaches and even different learning runs assign different scalar performance values to options and interactions among them. The true influence is uncertain, though. There is no way to quantify this uncertainty with state-of-the-art performance modeling approaches. We propose a novel approach, P4, based on probabilistic programming that explicitly models uncertainty for option influences and consequently provides a confidence interval for each prediction of a configuration's performance alongside a scalar. This way, we can explain, for the first time, why predictions may cause errors and which option's influences may be unreliable. An evaluation on 12 real-world subject systems shows that P4's accuracy is in line with the state of the art while providing reliable confidence intervals, in addition to scalar predictions.},

abstract = {Detecting and understanding reasons for defects and inadvertent behavior in software is challenging due to their increasing complexity. In configurable software systems, the combinatorics that arises from the multitude of features a user might select from adds a further layer of complexity. We introduce the notion of feature causality, which is based on counterfactual reasoning and inspired by the seminal definition of actual causality by Halpern and Pearl. Feature causality operates at the level of system configurations and is capable of identifying features and their interactions that are the reason for emerging functional and non-functional properties. We present various methods to explicate these reasons, in particular well-established notions of responsibility and blame that we extend to the feature-oriented setting. Establishing a close connection of feature causality to prime implicants, we provide algorithms to effectively compute feature causes and causal explications. By means of an evaluation on a wide range of configurable software systems, including community benchmarks and real-world systems, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach: We illustrate how our notion of causality facilitates to identify root causes, estimate the effects of features, and detect feature interactions.},

abstract = {Distributed message systems (DMSs) serve as the communication backbone for many real-time streaming data processing applications. To support the vast diversity of such applications, DMSs provide a large number of parameters to configure. However, It overwhelms for most users to configure these parameters well for better performance. Although many automatic configuration approaches have been proposed to address this issue, critical challenges still remain: 1) to train a better and robust performance prediction model using a limited number of samples, and 2) to search for a high-dimensional parameter space efficiently within a time constraint. In this paper, we propose AutoConfig -- an automatic configuration system that can optimize producer-side throughput on DMSs. AutoConfig constructs a novel comparison-based model (CBM) that is more robust that the prediction-based model (PBM) used by previous learning-based approaches. Furthermore, AutoConfig uses a weighted Latin hypercube sampling (wLHS) approach to select a set of samples that can provide a better coverage over the high-dimensional parameter space. wLHS allows AutoConfig to search for more promising configurations using the trained CBM. We have implemented AutoConfig on the Kafka platform, and evaluated it using eight different testing scenarios deployed on a public cloud. Experimental results show that our CBM can obtain better results than that of PBM under the same random forests based model. Furthermore, AutoConfig outperforms default configurations by 215.40% on average, and five state-of-the-art configuration algorithms by 7.21%-64.56%.},

Following the great success of the very first SIGIR-AP held in Beijing in November 2023, we have worked very hard with our organising team over a year so that SIGIR-AP 2024 will live up to its high expectations.As noted in the SIGIR-AP Charter and Bylaws, SIGIR-AP cares about sustainability, and is fully hybrid so that participants may choose to enjoy the conference online to avoid taking earth-unfriendly longdistance flights. Moreover, we are experimenting with a few novel approaches to running a sustainable conference, thanks to the generous support from the Tokyo Convention and Visitors Bureau: we will provide sustainable seafood lunch boxes, as well as a conference bag and a mug that are made from recycled plastic! In addition, a substantial portion of the banquet dishes will be vegetarian, which is known to be better for the environment than meat dishes (See Greta Thunberg: The Climate Book, p.249, Penguin Press, 2023).The SIGIR-AP 2024 features two keynotes from Japan: one by Dr. Momoe Makino (Institute of Developing Economies Japan External Trade Organization), titled Information Experiment: What Does Empirical Microeconomics Tell Us? and the other by Professor Sadao Kurohashi (National Institute of Informatics) titled From Data Platforms to Knowledge Infrastructure.
