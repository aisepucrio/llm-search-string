abstract = {The planning, realization, and release of a Software Product Line (SPL) are driven by features. Therefore, many high-level decisions about the evolution of an SPL are made at the feature level. However, a feature can involve many stakeholders with different expertise, and taking their opinions into account to make the right decisions is not trivial. In this paper, we propose using belief uncertainty in conjunction with feature models to assist in the evolution of SPLs by explicitly quantifying opinions. We outline three evolution scenarios in which subjective logic can be used to represent the opinions of stakeholders and explain in detail how to use subjective logic to make decisions in the context of the next release problem. We illustrate our ideas with a Smartwatch SPL. Finally, we discuss different ways of combining the opinions of stakeholders depending on the situation, the goals and the risks that can be assumed.},

abstract = {Kconfig is the de facto configuration language for describing and configuring the variability of the Linux kernel. Nonetheless, it has been used since the early stages of kernel development. Moreover, Kconfig is also used as a niche configuration languages, such as microkernel compilation for air navigation systems, proprietary routers or embedded systems. In the last decade, the software product line (SPL) community worked intensively on observing Linux Kernel and Kconfig. However, the official documentation is difficult to understand, and the examples are long and challenging to synthesize for non-Kconfig experts, such as SPL engineers, and researchers. In this paper, we propose a Kconfig metamodel based on the documentation and the feedback of a kernel developer expert. Thanks to this metamodel, the design of transformations from Kconfig to other variability models such as UVL (Universal Variability Language) can be facilitated. To our knowledge, this is the first proposal for a metamodel of the Kconfig language. This opens the door to further research, such as Kconfig analysis and transformations, and leverage interoperability among the Kconfig toolchain and SPL tools.},

abstract = {A configurable system is characterized by the configuration options present or absent in its variants. Selecting and deselecting those configuration options directly influences the functional properties of the system. Apart from functional properties, there are system characteristics that influence the performance (e.g., power demand), safety (e.g., fault probabilities), and security (e.g., susceptibility to attacks) of the system, called Non-Functional Properties (NFPs). Knowledge of NFPs is crucial for evaluating a system’s feasibility, usability, and resource demands. Although variability influences these characteristics, NFPs do not compose linearly for every selected feature. Feature interactions can increase the overall NFP values through (potentially exponential) amplification or decrease them through mitigation effects. In this paper, we propose an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict NFP values for new configurations based on previously measured configuration values. Using AutoML, we leverage the advantages of machine learning for predicting NFPs without having to parameterize and fine-tune machine learning models. This approach and the resulting pipeline aim to reduce the complexity of performance prediction for configurable systems. We test the feasibility of our pipeline in a first evaluation on 4 real-world subject systems and discuss cases where AutoML may improve the prediction of NFPs.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineers put a lot of effort to ensure that, through the setting of a large number of possible configuration options, products are acceptable and well-tailored to customers' needs. Unfortunately, options and their mutual interactions create a huge configuration space which is intractable to exhaustively explore. Instead of testing all products, machine learning is increasingly employed to approximate the set of acceptable products out of a small training sample of configurations. Machine learning (ML) techniques can refine a software product line through learned constraints and a priori prevent non-acceptable products to be derived. In this paper, we use adversarial ML techniques to generate adversarial configurations fooling ML classifiers and pinpoint incorrect classifications of products (videos) derived from an industrial video generator. Our attacks yield (up to) a 100% misclassification rate and a drop in accuracy of 5%. We discuss the implications these results have on SPL quality assurance.},

abstract = {Modern software systems must fulfill the needs of an ever-growing customer base. Due to the innate diversity of human needs, software should be highly customizable and reconfigurable. Researchers and practitioners gained interest in software product lines (SPL), mimicking aspects of product lines in industrial production for the engineering of highly-variable systems. There are two main approaches towards the engineering of SPLs. The first uses macros---such as the #ifdef macro in C. The second---called feature-oriented programming (FOP)---uses variability-aware preprocessors called composers to generate a program variant from a set of features and a configuration. Both approaches have disadvantages. Most notably, these approaches are usually not supported by the base language; for instance Java is one of the most commonly used FOP languages among researchers, but it does not support macros rather it relies on the C preprocessor or a custom one to translate macros into actual Java code. As a result, developers must struggle to keep up with the evolution of the base language, hindering the general applicability of SPL engineering. Moreover, to effectively evolve a software configuration and its features, their location must be known. The problem of recording and maintaining traceability information is considered expensive and error-prone and it is once again handled externally through dedicated modeling languages and tools. Instead, to properly convey the FOP paradigm, software features should be treated as first-class citizens using concepts that are proper to the host language, so that the variability can be expressed and analyzed with the same tools used to develop any other software in the same language. In this paper, we present a simple and flexible design pattern for JVM-based languages---dubbed devise pattern---that can be used to express feature dependencies and behaviors with a light-weight syntax both at domain analysis and at domain implementation level. To showcase the qualities and feasibility of our approach, we present several variability-aware implementations of a MNIST-encoder---including one using the devise pattern---and compare strengths and weaknesses of each approach.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is one of the main techniques used in Software Product Line Engineering to manage the variability within the products of a family. Concrete products of the family can be generated through a configuration process. The configuration process selects and/or removes features from the feature model according to the stakeholders' requirements. Selecting the right set of features for one product from amongst all of the available features in the feature model is a complex task because: 1) the multiplicity of stakeholders' functional requirements; 2) the positive or negative impact of features on non-functional properties; and 3) the stakeholders' preferences w.r.t. the desirable non-functional properties of the final product. Many configurations techniques have already been proposed to facilitate automated product derivation. However, most of the current proposals are not designed to consider stakeholders' preferences and constraints especially with regard to non-functional properties. We address the software product line configuration problem and propose a framework, which employs an artificial intelligence planning technique to automatically select suitable features that satisfy both the stakeholders' functional and non-functional preferences and constraints. We also provide tooling support to facilitate the use of our framework. Our experiments show that despite the complexity involved with the simultaneous consideration of both functional and non-functional properties our configuration technique is scalable.},

abstract = {The specialization of the configuration space of a software system has been considered for targeting specific configuration profiles, usages, deployment scenarios, or hardware settings. The challenge is to find constraints among options' values that only retain configurations meeting a performance objective. Since the exponential nature of configurable systems makes a manual specialization unpractical, several approaches have considered its automation using machine learning, i.e., measuring a sample of configurations and then learning what options' values should be constrained. Even focusing on learning techniques based on decision trees for their built-in explainability, there is still a wide range of possible approaches that need to be evaluated, i.e., how accurate is the specialization with regards to sampling size, performance thresholds, and kinds of configurable systems. In this paper, we compare six learning techniques: three variants of decision trees (including a novel algorithm) with and without the use of model-based feature selection. We first perform a study on 8 configurable systems considered in previous related works and show that the accuracy reaches more than 90% and that feature selection can improve the results in the majority of cases. We then perform a study on the Linux kernel and show that these techniques performs as well as on the other systems. Overall, our results show that there is no one-size-fits-all learning variant (though high accuracy can be achieved): we present guidelines and discuss tradeoffs.},

abstract = {Automation systems in industry are often software-intensive systems consisting of software and hardware components. During their development several engineers of different disciplines are involved, such as mechanical, electrical and software engineering. Each engineer focuses on specific system aspects to be developed. To enable an efficient development, product lines especially with feature models for variability modeling are promising technologies. In order to reduce the complexity of both feature models and development process, views on feature models can be applied. The use of views for filtering purposes constitutes an established method. However, views also enable further options missing in current approaches, such as evaluations regarding requirements, including non-functional ones. This paper presents an approach for evaluation across multiple views to enable collaborative development for developers who focus on different system aspects. We validate our approach by applying it in an industrial project for the planning of flying saws.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are a mature approach for the derivation of a family of products using systematic reuse. Different combinations of predefined features enable tailoring the product to fit the needs of each customer. These needs are related to functional properties of the system (optional features) as well as non-functional properties (e.g., performance or cost of the final product). In industrial scenarios, the configuration process of a final product is complex and the tool support is usually limited to check functional properties interdependencies. In addition, the importance of nonfunctional properties as relevant drivers during configuration has been overlooked. Thus, there is a lack of holistic paradigms integrating recommendation systems and visualizations that can help the decision makers. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an interrelated set of visualizations for the configuration process filling these gaps. We integrate them as part of the FeatureIDE tool and we evaluate its effectiveness, scalability, and performance.},

These specifications along with the stakeholders' configurations and the feature model are transformed into a constraint programming problem, on which decision rules are executed to find a non-conflicting set of solution configurations that are aligned to business objectives.

abstract = {Heterogeneity of embedded systems leads to the development of variable software, such as software product lines. From such a family of programs, stakeholders select the specific variant that satisfies their functional requirements. However, different functionality exposes different non-functional properties of these variants. Especially in the embedded-system domain, non-functional requirements are vital, because resources are scarce. Hence, when selecting an appropriate variant, we have to fulfill also non-functional requirements. Since more systems are interconnected, the challenge is to find a variant that additionally satisfies global nonfunctional (or quality) requirements. In this paper, we advert the problem of achieving interoperability of non-functional requirements among multiple interacting systems using a real-world scenario. Furthermore, we show an approach to find optimal variants for multiple systems that reduces computation effort by means of a stepwise configuration process.},

abstract = {Detecting and understanding reasons for defects and inadvertent behavior in software is challenging due to their increasing complexity. In configurable software systems, the combinatorics that arises from the multitude of features a user might select from adds a further layer of complexity. We introduce the notion of feature causality, which is based on counterfactual reasoning and inspired by the seminal definition of actual causality by Halpern and Pearl. Feature causality operates at the level of system configurations and is capable of identifying features and their interactions that are the reason for emerging functional and non-functional properties. We present various methods to explicate these reasons, in particular well-established notions of responsibility and blame that we extend to the feature-oriented setting. Establishing a close connection of feature causality to prime implicants, we provide algorithms to effectively compute feature causes and causal explications. By means of an evaluation on a wide range of configurable software systems, including community benchmarks and real-world systems, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach: We illustrate how our notion of causality facilitates to identify root causes, estimate the effects of features, and detect feature interactions.},
