abstract = {Software product lines (SPLs) and adaptive systems aim at variability to cope with changing requirements. Variability can be described in terms of features, which are central for development and configuration of SPLs. In traditional SPLs, features are bound statically before runtime. By contrast, adaptive systems support feature binding at runtime and are sometimes called dynamic SPLs (DSPLs). DSPLs are usually built from coarse-grained components, which reduces the number of possible application scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we closely integrate static binding of traditional SPLs and runtime adaptation of DSPLs. We achieve this integration by statically generating a tailor-made DSPL from a highly customizable SPL. The generated DSPL provides only the runtime variability required by a particular application scenario and the execution environment. The DSPL supports self-configuration based on coarse-grained modules. We provide a feature-based adaptation mechanism that reduces the effort of computing an optimal configuration at runtime. In a case study, we demonstrate the practicability of our approach and show that a seamless integration of static binding and runtime adaptation reduces the complexity of the adaptation process.},

abstract = {A software product line is a set of different software products that share commonalities. For a selection of features, specialized products of one domain can be generated automatically from domain artifacts. However, analyses of software product lines need to handle a large number of products that can be exponential in the number of features. In the last decade, many approaches have been proposed to analyze software product lines efficiently. For some of these approaches tool support is available. Based on a recent survey on analysis for software product lines, we provide a first overview on such tools. While our discussion is limited to analysis tools, we provide an accompanying website covering further tools for product-line development. We compare tools according to their analysis and implementation strategy to identify underrepresented areas. In addition, we want to ease the reuse of existing tools for researchers and students, and to simplify research transfer to practice.},

abstract = {Software product lines (SPL) aim at reducing time-to-market and increasing software quality through extensive, planned reuse of artifacts. An essential activity in SPL is variability management, i.e., defining and managing commonality and variability among member products. Due to the large scale and complexity of today's software-intensive systems, variability management has become increasingly complex to conduct. Accordingly, tool support for variability management has been gathering increasing momentum over the last few years and can be considered a key success factor for developing and maintaining SPLs. While several studies have already been conducted on variability management, none of these analyzed the available tool support in detail. In this work, we report on a survey in which we analyzed 37 existing variability management tools identified using a systematic literature review to understand the tools’ characteristics, maturity, and the challenges in the field. We conclude that while most studies on variability management tools provide a good motivation and description of the research context and challenges, they often lack empirical data to support their claims and findings. It was also found that quality attributes important for the practical use of tools such as usability, integration, scalability, and performance were out of scope for most studies.},

abstract = {Software product lines are used to efficiently develop and verify similar software products. While they focus on reuse of artifacts between products, a product line may also be reused itself in other product lines. A challenge with such dependent product lines is evolution; every change in a product line may influence all dependent product lines. With variability hiding, we aim to hide certain features and their artifacts in dependent product lines. In prior work, we focused on feature models and implementation artifacts. We build on this by discussing how variability hiding can be extended to specifications in terms of method contracts. We illustrate variability hiding in contracts by means of a running example and share our insights with preliminary experiments on the benefits for formal verification. In particular, we find that not every change in a certain product line requires a re-verification of other dependent product lines.},

abstract = {System software can typically be configured at compile time via a comfortable feature-based interface to tailor its functionality towards a specific use case. However, with the growing number of features, this tailoring process becomes increasingly difficult: As a prominent example, the Linux kernel in v3.14 provides nearly 14 000 configuration options to choose from. Even developers of embedded systems refrain from trying to build a minimized distinctive kernel configuration for their device – and thereby waste memory and money for unneeded functionality. In this paper, we present an approach for the automatic use-case specific tailoring of system software for special-purpose embedded systems. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the example of Linux by generating tailored kernels for well-known applications of the Rasperry Pi and a Google Nexus 4 smartphone. Compared to the original configurations, our approach leads to memory savings of 15–70 percent and requires only very little manual intervention.},

abstract = {Today, often small, heterogeneous systems have to cooperate in order to fulfill a certain task. Interoperability between these systems is needed for their collaboration. However, achieving this interoperability raises several problems. For example, embedded systems might induce a higher probability for a system failure due to constrained power supply. Nevertheless, interoperability must be guaranteed even in scenarios where embedded systems are used. To overcome this problem, we use services to abstract the functionality from the system which realizes it. We outline how services can be generated using software product line techniques to bridge the heterogeneity of cooperating systems. Additionally, we address runtime changes of already deployed services to overcome system failures. In this paper, we show the runtime adaption process of these changes which includes the following two points. First, we outline why feature-oriented programming is appropriate in such scenarios. Second, we describe the runtime adaption process of services with feature-oriented programming.},

abstract = {Modern software systems must fulfill the needs of an ever-growing customer base. Due to the innate diversity of human needs, software should be highly customizable and reconfigurable. Researchers and practitioners gained interest in software product lines (SPL), mimicking aspects of product lines in industrial production for the engineering of highly-variable systems. There are two main approaches towards the engineering of SPLs. The first uses macros---such as the #ifdef macro in C. The second---called feature-oriented programming (FOP)---uses variability-aware preprocessors called composers to generate a program variant from a set of features and a configuration. Both approaches have disadvantages. Most notably, these approaches are usually not supported by the base language; for instance Java is one of the most commonly used FOP languages among researchers, but it does not support macros rather it relies on the C preprocessor or a custom one to translate macros into actual Java code. As a result, developers must struggle to keep up with the evolution of the base language, hindering the general applicability of SPL engineering. Moreover, to effectively evolve a software configuration and its features, their location must be known. The problem of recording and maintaining traceability information is considered expensive and error-prone and it is once again handled externally through dedicated modeling languages and tools. Instead, to properly convey the FOP paradigm, software features should be treated as first-class citizens using concepts that are proper to the host language, so that the variability can be expressed and analyzed with the same tools used to develop any other software in the same language. In this paper, we present a simple and flexible design pattern for JVM-based languages---dubbed devise pattern---that can be used to express feature dependencies and behaviors with a light-weight syntax both at domain analysis and at domain implementation level. To showcase the qualities and feasibility of our approach, we present several variability-aware implementations of a MNIST-encoder---including one using the devise pattern---and compare strengths and weaknesses of each approach.},

Moreover, no framework was used to develop it, allowing any researcher to use the SPL without losing time learning some framework. In this work, we implemented an SPL test bed containing 34 functional features has 26.457 lines of code, 1493 methods and 496 classes.},

However, this is hard to achieve because energy-saving functions often depend on the hardware, and operating systems. The diversity of hardware components and operating systems makes the implementation time consuming and difficult. We propose an approach to automate energy optimization of programs by implementing energy-saving functionality as modular, separate implementation units (e.g., feature modules or aspects). These units are bundled as energy features into an energy-optimization feature library. Based on aspect-oriented and feature-oriented programming, we discuss different techniques to compose the source code of a client program and the implementation units of the energy features.},

abstract = {Clone-and-own development is a simple and flexible approach to realize multi-variant software systems in practice but typically provokes costly challenges in maintaining a continuously evolving set of variants. Therefore, managed clone-and-own development is key to efficiently mitigate these problems. While supporting techniques have been proposed in the literature, hardly any of them have been evaluated in a realistic setting due to a substantial lack of publicly available clone-and-own projects which could be used as experimental subjects. Recently, we presented the benchmark generation framework VEVOS for simulating clone-and-own development. However, it is yet unclear to which extent VEVOS can cover key scenarios for evaluating evolving variant-rich systems. This paper examines to what extent benchmarks created by VEVOS satisfy evaluation requirements for evolution scenarios demanded by the community. In addition, we report on our own experiences when employing VEVOS within six studies and elaborate on necessary extensions we implemented into VEVOS.},

abstract = {A number of product-line analysis approaches lift analyses such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving from the level of single programs to the level of product lines. These approaches share concepts and mechanisms that suggest an unexplored potential for reuse of key analysis steps and properties, implementation, and verification efforts. Despite the availability of taxonomies synthesizing such approaches, there still remains the underlying problem of not being able to describe product-line analyses and their properties precisely and uniformly. We propose a formal framework that models product-line analyses in a compositional manner, providing an overall understanding of the space of family-based, feature-based, and product-based analysis strategies. It defines precisely how the different types of product-line analyses compose and inter-relate. To ensure soundness, we formalize the framework, providing mechanized specification and proofs of key concepts and properties of the individual analyses. The formalization provides unambiguous definitions of domain terminology and assumptions as well as solid evidence of key properties based on rigorous formal proofs. To qualitatively assess the generality of the framework, we discuss to what extent it describes five representative product-line analyses targeting the following properties: safety, performance, dataflow facts, security, and functional program properties.},

Variation in space refers to differences among variants that are designed to coexist in parallel. There are numerous analyses to cope with variation in space (i.e., product-line analyses) and others that cope with variation in time (i.e., regression analyses). The goal of this work is to discuss to which extent product-line analyses can be applied to revisions and, conversely, where regression analyses can be applied to variants. In addition, we discuss challenges related to the combination of product-line and regression analyses.

A number of systematic literature reviews exist that identify the main characteristics offered by existing tools and the SPL phases in which they can be applied. However, these reviews do not really help to understand if those tools are offering what is really needed to apply SPLs to complex projects. These studies are mainly based on information extracted from the tool documentation or published papers. In this paper, we follow a different approach, in which we firstly identify those characteristics that are currently essential for the development of an SPL, and secondly analyze whether the tools provide or not support for those characteristics. We focus on those tools that satisfy certain selection criteria (e.g., they can be downloaded and are ready to be used). The paper presents a state of practice with the availability and usability of the existing tools for SPL, and defines different roadmaps that allow carrying out a complete SPL process with the existing tool support.},

Historical software product lines contains industrial secrets their owners do not want to disclose to a wide audience. The open source community contributed to large-scale cases such as Eclipse, Linux kernels, or web-based plugin systems (Drupal, WordPress). To assess accuracy of sampling and prediction approaches (bugs, performance), a case where all products can be enumerated is desirable. As configuration issues do not lie within only one place but are scattered across technologies and assets, a case exposing such diversity is an additional asset. To this end, we present in this paper our efforts in building an explicit product line on top of JHipster, an industrial open-source Web-app configurator that is both manageable in terms of configurations (≈ 163,000) and diverse in terms of technologies used. We present our efforts in building a variability-aware chain on top of JHipster's configurator and lessons learned using it as a teaching case at the University of Rennes. We also sketch the diversity of analyses that can be performed with our infrastructure as well as early issues found using it. Our long term goal is both to support students and researchers studying variability analysis and JHipster developers in the maintenance and evolution of their tools.},

abstract = {Software projects use build systems to automate the compilation, testing, and continuous deployment of their software products. As software becomes increasingly configurable, the build of multiple configurations is a pressing need, but expensive and challenging to implement. The current state of practice is to build independently (a.k.a., clean build) a software for a subset of configurations. While incremental build has been studied for software evolution and relatively small changes of the source code, it has surprisingly not been considered for software configurations. In this exploratory study, we examine the benefits and limits of building software configurations incrementally, rather than always building them cleanly. By using five real-life configurable systems as subjects, we explore whether incremental build works, outperforms a sequence of clean builds, is correct w.r.t. clean build, and can be used to find an optimal ordering for building configurations. Our results show that incremental build is feasible in 100% of the times in four subjects and in 78% of the times in one subject. In average, 88.5% of the configurations could be built faster with incremental build while also finding several alternatives faster incremental builds. However, only 60% of faster incremental builds are correct. Still, when considering those correct incremental builds with clean builds, we could always find an optimal order that is faster than just a collection of clean builds with a gain up to 11.76%.},

abstract = {Architecture-centric development addresses the increasing complexity and variability of software systems by focusing on architectural models, which are generally easier to understand and manipulate than source code. It requires a mechanism that can maintain architecture-implementation conformance during architectural development and evolution. The challenge is twofold. There is an abstraction gap between software architecture and implementation, and both may evolve. Existing approaches are deficient in support for both change mapping and product line architecture. This article presents a novel approach named 1.x-way mapping and its extension, 1.x-line mapping to support architecture-implementation mapping in single system development and in product line development, respectively. They specifically address mapping architecture changes to code, maintaining variability conformance between product line architecture and code, and tracing architectural implementation. We built software tools named xMapper and xLineMapper to realize the two approaches, and conducted case studies with two existing open-source systems to evaluate the approaches.

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing is getting more important since requirements for complex systems grow fast. In these systems, embedded devices have to fulfill different tasks. They have to monitor the environment, store data, communicate with other devices, and react to user input. In addition to this complexity, quality issues such as security and reliability have to be considered, as well, due to their increasing use in life critical application scenarios. Finally, different devices with different application goals are used, which results in interoperability problems. In this paper, we highlight challenges for interoperability, data management, and security, which arise with complex systems. Furthermore, we present approaches to overcome different problems and how an integrated solution can be realized using software product line techniques.},

abstract = {Product-line analysis has received considerable attention in the last decade. As it is often infeasible to analyze each product of a product line individually, researchers have developed analyses, called variability-aware analyses, that consider and exploit variability manifested in a code base. Variability-aware analyses are often significantly more efficient than traditional analyses, but each of them has certain weaknesses regarding applicability or scalability. We present the Product-Line-Analysis model, a formal model for the classification and comparison of existing analyses, including traditional and variability-aware analyses, and lay a foundation for formulating and exploring further, combined analyses. As a proof of concept, we discuss different examples of analyses in the light of our model, and demonstrate its benefits for systematic comparison and exploration of product-line analyses.},

As practitioners increasingly develop software systems as product lines, there is a growing potential to reuse product lines in other product lines, which we refer to as multi product line. We identify challenges when developing multi product lines and propose interfaces for different levels of abstraction ranging from variability modeling to functional and non-functional properties. We argue that these interfaces ease the reuse of product lines and identify research questions that need to be solved toward modular analysis of multi product lines.},

abstract = {Product Derivation is a key activity in Software Product Line Engineering. During this process, derivation operators modify or create core assets (e.g., model elements, source code instructions, components) by adding, removing or substituting them according to a given configuration. The result is a derived product that generally needs to conform to a programming or modeling language. Some operators lead to invalid products when applied to certain assets, some others do not; knowing this in advance can help to better use them, however this is challenging, specially if we consider assets expressed in extensive and complex languages such as Java. In this paper, we empirically answer the following question: which product line operators, applied to which program elements, can synthesize variants of programs that are incorrect, correct or perhaps even conforming to test suites? We implement source code transformations, based on the derivation operators of the Common Variability Language. We automatically synthesize more than 370,000 program variants from a set of 8 real large Java projects (up to 85,000 lines of code), obtaining an extensive panorama of the sanity of the operations.},

abstract = {The feature-interaction problem has been explored for many years. Still, we lack sufficient knowledge about the interplay of different kinds of interactions in software product lines. Exploring the relations between different kinds of feature interactions will allow us to learn more about the nature of interactions and their causes. This knowledge can then be applied for improving existing approaches for detecting, managing, and resolving feature interactions. We present a framework for studying relations between different kinds of interactions. Furthermore, we report and discuss the results of a preliminary study in which we examined correlations between internal feature interactions (quantified by a set of software measures) and external feature interactions (represented by product-line-specific type errors). We performed the evaluation on a set of 15 feature-oriented, Java-based product lines. We observed moderate correlations between the interactions under discussion. This gives us confidence that we can apply our approach to studying other types of external feature interactions (e.g., performance interactions).},

abstract = {Software Product Line has acquired a significant momentum at the end of the 1990ies since it allows the production of variable software systems corresponding to the same domain portfolio. The effectiveness of the derivation process depends on how well variability is defined and implemented which is a crucial topic area that was addressed among two essential trends: On the one hand, starting from Domain Specific Modelling Language to express domain requirements and automate the code generation with Model-Driven Engineering techniques and on the second hand, exploiting the soar of variability mechanisms.In this context, the current research presents a method that unifies the two aforementioned approaches to cover the overall strategies by defining a framework that allows a better code generation in terms of documentation, maintainability, rapidity,etc. The starting point is the usage of the Domain Specific Modelling Language to represent the stakeholders requirements. Then, the resulting meta-model will be converted into one our several Feature Diagrams on which variability mechanisms can be applied to generate all the family products.A preliminary experiment has been undertaken to design the methodology of the proposed software factory in a meta-model. The validation task was evaluated with an academic use case called HandiWeb developed to facilitate handicap persons access to the internet. The first results allow us to put the hand on the key challenges that must be resolved by the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {Data management functionality is not only needed in large-scale server systems, but also in embedded systems. Resource restrictions and heterogeneity of hardware, however, complicate the development of data management solutions for those systems. In current practice, this typically leads to the redevelopment of data management because existing solutions cannot be reused and adapted appropriately. In this paper, we present our ongoing work on FAME-DBMS, a research project that explores techniques to implement highly customizable data management solutions, and illustrate how such systems can be created with a software product line approach. With this approach a concrete instance of a DBMS is derived by composing features of the DBMS product line that are needed for a specific application scenario. This product derivation process is getting complex if a large number of features is available. Furthermore, in embedded systems also non-functional properties, e.g., memory consumption, have to be considered when creating a DBMS instance. To simplify the derivation process we present approaches for its automation.},

abstract = {Most contemporary programs are customizable. They provide many features that give rise to millions of program variants. Determining which feature selection yields an optimal performance is challenging, because of the exponential number of variants. Predicting the performance of a variant based on previous measurements proved successful, but induces a trade-off between the measurement effort and prediction accuracy. We propose the alternative approach of family-based performance measurement, to reduce the number of measurements required for identifying feature interactions and for obtaining accurate predictions. The key idea is to create a variant simulator (by translating compile-time variability to run-time variability) that can simulate the behavior of all program variants. We use it to measure performance of individual methods, trace methods to features, and infer feature interactions based on the call graph. We evaluate our approach by means of five feature-oriented programs. On average, we achieve accuracy of 98%, with only a single measurement per customizable program. Observations show that our approach opens avenues of future research in different domains, such an feature-interaction detection and testing.},

abstract = {The variability of a software product line (SPL)is often described with a feature model. To avoid highly complex models, stakeholders usually try to separate different variability dimensions, such as domain variability and implementation variability. This results in distinct variability models, which are easier to handle than one large model. On the other hand, it is sometimes required to analyze the variability dimensions of an SPL in combination using a single model only. To combine separate modeling and integrated analysis of variability, we present Velvet, a language for multi-dimensional variability modeling. Velvet allows stakeholders to model each variability dimension of an SPL separately and to compose the separated dimensions on demand. This improves reuse of feature models and supports independent modeling variability dimensions. Furthermore, Velvet integrates feature modeling and configuration in a single language. The combination of both concepts creates further reuse opportunities and allows stakeholders to independently configure variability dimensions.},
