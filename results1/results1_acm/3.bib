abstract = {Although Software Product Lines are recurrently praised as an efficient paradigm for systematic reuse, practical adoption remains challenging. For bottom-up Software Product Line adoption, where a set of artefact variants already exists, practitioners lack end-to-end support for chaining (1) feature identification, (2) feature location, (3) feature constraints discovery, as well as (4) reengineering approaches. This challenge can be overcome if there exists a set of principles for building a framework to integrate various algorithms and to support different artefact types. In this paper, we propose the principles of such a framework and we provide insights on how it can be extended with adapters, algorithms and visualisations enabling their use in different scenarios. We describe its realization in BUT4Reuse (Bottom--Up Technologies for Reuse) and we assess its generic and extensible properties by implementing a variety of extensions. We further empirically assess the complexity of integration by reproducing case studies from the literature. Finally, we present an experiment where users realize a bottom-up Software Product Line adoption building on the case study of Eclipse variants.},

abstract = {Most models of utility elicitation in decision support and interactive optimization assume a predefined set of "catalog" features over which user preferences are expressed. However, users may differ in the features over which they are most comfortable expressing their preferences. In this work we consider the problem of feature elicitation: a user's utility function is expressed using features whose definitions (in terms of "catalog" features) are unknown. We cast this as a problem of concept learning, but whose goal is to identify only enough about the concept to enable a good decision to be recommended. We describe computational procedures for identifying optimal alternatives w.r.t. minimax regret in the presence of concept uncertainty; and describe several heuristic query strategies that focus on reduction of relevant concept uncertainty.},
