abstract = {The lack of mature tool support is one of the main reasons that make the industry to be reluctant to adopt Software Product Line (SPL) approaches. A number of systematic literature reviews exist that identify the main characteristics offered by existing tools and the SPL phases in which they can be applied. However, these reviews do not really help to understand if those tools are offering what is really needed to apply SPLs to complex projects. These studies are mainly based on information extracted from the tool documentation or published papers. In this paper, we follow a different approach, in which we firstly identify those characteristics that are currently essential for the development of an SPL, and secondly analyze whether the tools provide or not support for those characteristics. We focus on those tools that satisfy certain selection criteria (e.g., they can be downloaded and are ready to be used). The paper presents a state of practice with the availability and usability of the existing tools for SPL, and defines different roadmaps that allow carrying out a complete SPL process with the existing tool support.},

However, preserving NFRs across product variants induces considerable challenges, particularly in goal-oriented SPLE where goals guide product derivation. This research proposes a novel framework to preserve NFRs in goal models using meta-models of SPLs and manage inconsistent NFRs. The framework utilizes product and domain meta-models to accurately capture and represent NFRs, addressing construct validity concerns. This research aims to enhance the credibility and generalizability of findings in SPL engineering, contributing to the advancement of goal-oriented modeling and NFR preservation practices.},

abstract = {A number of product-line analysis approaches lift analyses such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving from the level of single programs to the level of product lines. These approaches share concepts and mechanisms that suggest an unexplored potential for reuse of key analysis steps and properties, implementation, and verification efforts. Despite the availability of taxonomies synthesizing such approaches, there still remains the underlying problem of not being able to describe product-line analyses and their properties precisely and uniformly. We propose a formal framework that models product-line analyses in a compositional manner, providing an overall understanding of the space of family-based, feature-based, and product-based analysis strategies. It defines precisely how the different types of product-line analyses compose and inter-relate. To ensure soundness, we formalize the framework, providing mechanized specification and proofs of key concepts and properties of the individual analyses. The formalization provides unambiguous definitions of domain terminology and assumptions as well as solid evidence of key properties based on rigorous formal proofs. To qualitatively assess the generality of the framework, we discuss to what extent it describes five representative product-line analyses targeting the following properties: safety, performance, dataflow facts, security, and functional program properties.},

We analysed a subset (140) of all (593) papers published at the Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) until 2017. The subset was randomly selected to cover all years as well as types of papers. We assessed the research type of the papers (academic or industry), the kind of evaluation (application example, empirical, etc.), and the application domain. Also, we assessed which product line life-cycle phases, development practices, and topics the papers address. We present an analysis of the topics covered by academic vs. industry research and discuss the evolution of these topics and their relation over the years. We also discuss implications for researchers and practitioners. We conclude that even though several topics have received more attention than others, academic and industry research on software product lines are actually rather in line with each other.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is a compelling methodology that accomplishes systematic reuse in families of systems by relying on two key principles: (i) the decomposition of complex systems into composable and reusable building blocks (often logical units called features), and (ii) on-demand construction of products and product variants by composing these building blocks.However, unless the stakeholder responsible for product configuration has detailed knowledge of the technical ins and outs of the software product line (e.g., the architectural impact of a specific feature, or potential feature interactions), he is in many cases flying in the dark. Although many initial approaches and techniques have been proposed that take into account quality considerations and involve trade-off decisions during product configuration, no systematic support exists.In this paper, we present a reference architecture for product configuration tooling, providing support for (i) up-front generation of variants, and (ii) quality analysis of these variants. This allows pro-actively assessing and predicting architectural quality properties for each product variant and in turn, product configuration tools can take into account architectural considerations. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of techniques and tactics for dealing with the problem of variant explosion, and as such to maintain practical feasibility of such approaches.We validated and implemented our reference architecture in the context of a real-world industrial application, a product-line for the firmware of an automotive sensor. Our prototype, based on FeatureIDE, is open for extension and readily available.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineers put a lot of effort to ensure that, through the setting of a large number of possible configuration options, products are acceptable and well-tailored to customers' needs. Unfortunately, options and their mutual interactions create a huge configuration space which is intractable to exhaustively explore. Instead of testing all products, machine learning is increasingly employed to approximate the set of acceptable products out of a small training sample of configurations. Machine learning (ML) techniques can refine a software product line through learned constraints and a priori prevent non-acceptable products to be derived. In this paper, we use adversarial ML techniques to generate adversarial configurations fooling ML classifiers and pinpoint incorrect classifications of products (videos) derived from an industrial video generator. Our attacks yield (up to) a 100% misclassification rate and a drop in accuracy of 5%. We discuss the implications these results have on SPL quality assurance.},

abstract = {Modern software systems must fulfill the needs of an ever-growing customer base. Due to the innate diversity of human needs, software should be highly customizable and reconfigurable. Researchers and practitioners gained interest in software product lines (SPL), mimicking aspects of product lines in industrial production for the engineering of highly-variable systems. There are two main approaches towards the engineering of SPLs. The first uses macros---such as the #ifdef macro in C. The second---called feature-oriented programming (FOP)---uses variability-aware preprocessors called composers to generate a program variant from a set of features and a configuration. Both approaches have disadvantages. Most notably, these approaches are usually not supported by the base language; for instance Java is one of the most commonly used FOP languages among researchers, but it does not support macros rather it relies on the C preprocessor or a custom one to translate macros into actual Java code. As a result, developers must struggle to keep up with the evolution of the base language, hindering the general applicability of SPL engineering. Moreover, to effectively evolve a software configuration and its features, their location must be known. The problem of recording and maintaining traceability information is considered expensive and error-prone and it is once again handled externally through dedicated modeling languages and tools. Instead, to properly convey the FOP paradigm, software features should be treated as first-class citizens using concepts that are proper to the host language, so that the variability can be expressed and analyzed with the same tools used to develop any other software in the same language. In this paper, we present a simple and flexible design pattern for JVM-based languages---dubbed devise pattern---that can be used to express feature dependencies and behaviors with a light-weight syntax both at domain analysis and at domain implementation level. To showcase the qualities and feasibility of our approach, we present several variability-aware implementations of a MNIST-encoder---including one using the devise pattern---and compare strengths and weaknesses of each approach.},

On the other hand, systematic reviews are widely used in the software engineering research community to provide the overview of the research field and practitioners guidelines. Researchers have conducted many systematic studies on the different aspects of SPLs. To the best of our knowledge, till now there is no tertiary study conducted on systematic studies of SPL related research topics. In this paper, we aim at conducting a systematic mapping study of existing systematic studies to report the overview of the findings for researchers and practitioners. We performed snowballing and automated search to find out the relevant systematic studies. As a result, we analyzed 60 relevant studies to answer 5 research questions. The main focus of this tertiary study is to highlight the research topics, type of published reviews, active researchers and publication forums. Additionally, we highlight some of the limitations of the systematic studies. The important finding of this study is that the research field is well matured as the systematic studies covered a wide range of research topics. Another important finding is that many studies provided information for practitioners as well as researchers which is a notable improvement in the systematic reviews. However, many studies failed to assess the quality of the primary studies which is the major limitation of the existing systematic studies.},

Designers of variability-rich software face the challenge of reasoning about the impact of selecting such features on the quality attributes of the resulting software variant. Attributed feature models have been proposed to model such features and their impact on quality attributes, but existing variability modelling languages and tools have limited or no support for such models and the complex multi-objective optimization problem that arises. This paper presents ClaferMoo, a language and tool that addresses these shortcomings. ClaferMoo uses type inheritance to modularize the attribution of features in feature models and allows specifying multiple optimization goals. We evaluate an implementation of the language on a set of attributed feature models from the literature, showing that the optimization infrastructure can handle small-scale feature models with about a dozen features within seconds.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) engineering is a software development approach that takes advantage of the commonality and variability between products from a family, and supports the generation of specific products by reusing a set of core family assets. This paper proposes a UML model transformation approach for software product lines to derive a performance model for a specific product. The input to the proposed technique, the "source model", is a UML model of a SPL with performance annotations, which uses two separate profiles: a "product line" profile from literature for specifying the commonality and variability between products, and the MARTE profile recently standardized by OMG for performance annotations. The source model is generic and therefore its performance annotations must be parameterized. The proposed derivation of a performance model for a concrete product requires two steps: a) the transformation of a SPL model to a UML model with performance annotations for a given product, and b) the transformation of the outcome of the first step into a performance model. This paper focuses on the first step, whereas the second step will use the PUMA transformation approach of annotated UML models to performance models, developed in previous work. The output of the first step, named "target model", is a UML model with MARTE annotations, where the variability expressed in the SPL model has been analyzed and bound to a specific product, and the generic performance annotations have been bound to concrete values for the product. The proposed technique is illustrated with an e-commerce case study.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is one of the main techniques used in Software Product Line Engineering to manage the variability within the products of a family. Concrete products of the family can be generated through a configuration process. The configuration process selects and/or removes features from the feature model according to the stakeholders' requirements. Selecting the right set of features for one product from amongst all of the available features in the feature model is a complex task because: 1) the multiplicity of stakeholders' functional requirements; 2) the positive or negative impact of features on non-functional properties; and 3) the stakeholders' preferences w.r.t. the desirable non-functional properties of the final product. Many configurations techniques have already been proposed to facilitate automated product derivation. However, most of the current proposals are not designed to consider stakeholders' preferences and constraints especially with regard to non-functional properties. We address the software product line configuration problem and propose a framework, which employs an artificial intelligence planning technique to automatically select suitable features that satisfy both the stakeholders' functional and non-functional preferences and constraints. We also provide tooling support to facilitate the use of our framework. Our experiments show that despite the complexity involved with the simultaneous consideration of both functional and non-functional properties our configuration technique is scalable.},

abstract = {Efficient configuration management system is crucial for the success of any software product line (SPL). Due to ever changing needs of customers, SPL undergoes constant changes that are to be tracked in real time. In the context of customer-driven development, anticipation and change management are to be given paramount importance. It demands implementation of software variability that drives home changed, extended and customized configurations besides economy at scale. Moreover, the emergence of distributed technologies, the unprecedented growth of component based, serviceoriented systems throw ever increasing challenges to software product line configuration management. Derivation of a new product is a dynamic process in software product line that should consider functionality and quality attributes. Very few approaches are found on configuration management (CM) of SPL though CM is enough matured for traditional products. They are tailor made and inadequate to provide a general solution. Stated differently, a comprehensive approach for SPL configuration management and product derivation is still to be desired. In this paper, we proposed a framework that guides in doing so besides helping in SPL definitions in generic way. Our framework facilitates SPL configuration management and product derivation based on critical path analysis, weight computation and feedback. We proposed two algorithms namely Quality Driven Product Derivation (QDPD) and Composition Analysis algorithm for generating satisfied compositions and to find best possible composition respectively. The usage of weights and critical path analysis improves quality of product derivation. The framework is extensible and flexible thus it can be leveraged with variability-aware design patterns and ontology. We built a prototype that demonstrates the proof of concept. We tested our approach with Dr. School product line. The results reveal that the framework supports configuration management of SPL and derivation of high quality product in the product line. We evaluated results with ground truth to establish significance of our implementation},

abstract = {The detection of interactions is a challenging task present in almost all stages of software development. In feature-oriented system design, this task is mainly investigated for interactions of features within a single system, detected by their emergent behaviors. We propose a formalism to describe interactions in hierarchies of feature-oriented systems (hierarchical interactions) and the actual situations where features interact (active interplays). Based on the observation that such interactions are also crucial in role-based systems, we introduce a compositional modeling framework based on concepts and notions of roles, comprising role-based automata (RBAs). To describe RBAs, we present a modeling language that is close to the input language of the probabilistic model checker Prism. To exemplify the use of RBAs, we implemented a tool that translates RBA models into Prism and thus enables the formal analysis of functional and non-functional properties including system dynamics, contextual changes, and interactions. We carry out two case studies as a proof of concept of such analyses: First, a peer-to-peer protocol case study illustrates how undesired hierarchical interactions can be discovered automatically. Second, a case study on a self-adaptive production cell demonstrates how undesired interactions influence quality-of-service measures such as reliability and throughput.},

abstract = {Within software product lines, customers may have different quality needs. To produce products with purposefully different quality attributes, several challenges must be addressed. First, one must be able to distinguish product quality attributes to the customers in a meaningful way. Second, one must create the desired quality attribute differences during product-line architecture design and derivation. To study how performance is varied purposefully in software product lines, we conducted a comparison and re-analysis of two industrial case studies in the telecommunication and mobile game domains. The results show that performance variants must be communicated to the customer in a way that links to customer value and her role. When performance or its adaptation are crucial for the customer, performance differences must be explicitly "designed in" with software or hardware means. Due to the emergent nature of performance, it is important to test performance and manage how other variability affects performance.},

abstract = {Product Derivation is a key activity in Software Product Line Engineering. During this process, derivation operators modify or create core assets (e.g., model elements, source code instructions, components) by adding, removing or substituting them according to a given configuration. The result is a derived product that generally needs to conform to a programming or modeling language. Some operators lead to invalid products when applied to certain assets, some others do not; knowing this in advance can help to better use them, however this is challenging, specially if we consider assets expressed in extensive and complex languages such as Java. In this paper, we empirically answer the following question: which product line operators, applied to which program elements, can synthesize variants of programs that are incorrect, correct or perhaps even conforming to test suites? We implement source code transformations, based on the derivation operators of the Common Variability Language. We automatically synthesize more than 370,000 program variants from a set of 8 real large Java projects (up to 85,000 lines of code), obtaining an extensive panorama of the sanity of the operations.},

abstract = {Many systems in the industrial automation domain include information systems. They manage manufacturing processes and control numerous distributed hardware and software components. In current practice, the development and reuse of such systems is costly and time-consuming, due to the variability of systems' topology and processes. Up to now, product line approaches for systematic modeling and management of variability have not been well established for such complex domains.In this paper, we present a model-based approach to support the derivation of systems in the target domain. The proposed architecture of the derivation infrastructure enables feature-, topology- and process configuration to be integrated into the multi-staged derivation process. We have developed a prototype to prove feasibility and improvement of derivation efficiency. We report the evaluation results that we collected through semi-structured interviews from domain stakeholders. The results show high potential to improve derivation efficiency by adopting the approach in practice. Finally, we report the lessons learned that raise the opportunities and challenges for future research.},

abstract = {Business calculations like break-even, return on investment, or cost are essential in many domains to support decision making while configuring products. For instance, customers and sales people need to estimate and compare the business value of different product variants. Some product line approaches provide initial support, e.g., by defining quality attributes in relation to features. However, an approach that allows domain engineers to easily define business calculations together with variability models is still lacking. In product configuration, calculation results need to be instantly presented to end users after making configuration choices. Further, due to the often high number of calculations, the presentation of calculation results to end users can be challenging. These challenges cannot be addressed by integrating off-the-shelf applications performing the calculations with product line tools. We thus present an approach based on dedicated calculation models that are related to variability models. Our approach seamlessly integrates business calculations with product configuration and provides support for formatting calculations and calculation results. We use the DOPLER tool suite to deploy calculations together with variability models to end users in product configuration. We evaluate the expressiveness and practical relevance of the approach by investigating the development of business calculations for 15 product lines from the domain of industrial automation.},

Two important pillars of this initiative are "smart products" and "smart factories". From the perspective of product line engineering, these can be seen as two product lines (product line of factories and product line of goods) that need to be integrated for a common systems engineering approach. In this paper, we look at this problem from the perspective of configuration technologies, outline the research challenges in this area and illustrate our vision using an industrial example. The factory product line goes hand-in-hand with the product line of the products to be manufactured. Future research in product line engineering needs to consider an ecosystem of a multitude of stakeholders - e.g., factory component vendors, product designers, factory owners/operators and end-consumers.},

This activity gets even more complicated when it involves multiple stakeholders in the configuration process. Research work has proposed approaches to aid multi-stakeholder feature model configuration, but they rely on systematic processes that constraint decisions of some of the stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the multi-stakeholder configuration process, considering stakeholders' preferences expressed through both hard and soft constraints. Based on such preferences, we recommend different product configurations using different strategies from the social choice theory. We conducted an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies with respect to individual stakeholder satisfaction and fairness among all stakeholders. Results indicate that particular strategies perform best with respect to these aspects.},

abstract = {Software that support various groups of customers usually require complicated configurations to attain different functionalities. To model the configuration options, feature model is proposed to capture the commonalities and competing variabilities of the product variants in software family or Software Product Line (SPL). A key challenge for deriving a new product is to find a set of features that do not have inconsistencies or conflicts, yet optimize multiple objectives (e.g., minimizing cost and maximizing number of features), which are often competing with each other. Existing works have attempted to make use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to address this problem. In this work, we incorporated a novel feedback-directed mechanism into existing EAs. Our empirical results have shown that our method has improved noticeably over all unguided version of EAs on the optimal feature selection. In particular, for case studies in SPLOT and LVAT repositories, the feedback-directed Indicator-Based EA (IBEA) has increased the number of correct solutions found by 72.33% and 75%, compared to unguided IBEA. In addition, by leveraging a pre-computed solution, we have found 34 sound solutions for Linux X86, which contains 6888 features, in less than 40 seconds.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) engineering has emerged to provide the means to efficiently model, produce, and maintain multiple similar software variants, exploiting their common properties, and managing their variabilities (differences). With over two decades of existence, the community of SPL researchers and practitioners is thriving, as can be attested by the extensive research output and the numerous successful industrial projects. Education has a key role to support the next generation of practitioners to build highly complex, variability-intensive systems. Yet, it is unclear how the concepts of variability and SPLs are taught, what are the possible missing gaps and difficulties faced, what are the benefits, and what is the material available. Also, it remains unclear whether scholars teach what is actually needed by industry. In this article, we report on three initiatives we have conducted with scholars, educators, industry practitioners, and students to further understand the connection between SPLs and education, that is, an online survey on teaching SPLs we performed with 35 scholars, another survey on learning SPLs we conducted with 25 students, as well as two workshops held at the International Software Product Line Conference in 2014 and 2015 with both researchers and industry practitioners participating. We build upon the two surveys and the workshops to derive recommendations for educators to continue improving the state of practice of teaching SPLs, aimed at both individual educators as well as the wider community.},

While developing an educational software product line, we identified a lack of support to specify variability in quality concerns. To address this problem we propose an approach to model variability in quality concerns, which is an extension of quality attribute scenarios. In particular, we propose domain quality attribute scenarios, which extend standard quality attribute scenarios with additional information to support specification of variability and deriving product specific scenarios. We demonstrate the approach with scenarios for robustness and upgradability requirements in the educational software product line.},

From recent works on product properties resulting from configurations and the optimisation of these properties, one comes quickly to more complex challenges such as multi-objective optimisation, conflicting objectives, multiple stakeholders, and conflict resolution. The intuition is that Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) can draw from other disciplines that deal with decision spaces and complex decision scenarios.Objectives. We aim to (1) explore links to such disciplines, (2) systematise and compare concepts, and (3) identify opportunities, where SPLE approaches can be enriched.Method. We undertake an exploratory study: Starting from common SPLE activities and artefacts, we identify aspects where we expect to find corresponding counterparts in other disciplines. We focus on Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO), and Design Space Exploration (DSE), and perform a comparison of the key concepts.Results. The resulting comparison relates SPLE activities and artefacts to concepts from MCDA, MOO, and DSE and identifies areas where SPLE approaches can be enriched. We also provide examples of existing work at the intersections of SPLE with the other fields. These findings are aimed to foster the conversation on research opportunities where SPLE can draw techniques from other disciplines dealing with complex decision scenarios.},

Resource restrictions and heterogeneity of hardware, however, complicate the development of data management solutions for those systems. In current practice, this typically leads to the redevelopment of data management because existing solutions cannot be reused and adapted appropriately. In this paper, we present our ongoing work on FAME-DBMS, a research project that explores techniques to implement highly customizable data management solutions, and illustrate how such systems can be created with a software product line approach. With this approach a concrete instance of a DBMS is derived by composing features of the DBMS product line that are needed for a specific application scenario. This product derivation process is getting complex if a large number of features is available. Furthermore, in embedded systems also non-functional properties, e.g., memory consumption, have to be considered when creating a DBMS instance. To simplify the derivation process we present approaches for its automation.},

A configuration problem is defined as generating the most optimal combination of software features given a requirements specification and given a set of configuration rules. Current approaches however provide little support for expressing complex configuration rules between problem and solution space that support incomplete requirements specifications. In this paper, we propose an approach to model complex configuration rules based on a generalization of the concept of problem-solution feature interactions. These are interactions between solution-space features that only arise in specific problem contexts. The use of an existing tool to support our approach is also discussed: we use the DLV answer set solver to express a particular configuration problem as a logic program whose answer set corresponds to the optimal combinations of solution-space features. We motivate and illustrate our approach with a case study in the field of managing dynamic adaptations in distributed software, where the goal is to generate an optimal protocol for accommodating a given adaptation.},

abstract = {Context: Many software systems are highly configurable. Different configuration options could lead to varying performances of the system. It is difficult to measure system performance in the presence of an exponential number of possible combinations of these options.Goal: Predicting software performance by using a small configuration sample.Method: This paper proposes Perf-AL to address this problem via adversarial learning. Specifically, we use a generative network combined with several different regularization techniques (L1 regularization, L2 regularization and a dropout technique) to output predicted values as close to the ground truth labels as possible. With the use of adversarial learning, our network identifies and distinguishes the predicted values of the generator network from the ground truth value distribution. The generator and the discriminator compete with each other by refining the prediction model iteratively until its predicted values converge towards the ground truth distribution.Results: We argue that (i) the proposed method can achieve the same level of prediction accuracy, but with a smaller number of training samples. (ii) Our proposed model using seven real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. This help to further promote software configurable performance.Conclusion: Experimental results on seven public real-world datasets demonstrate that PERF-AL outperforms state-of-the-art software performance prediction methods.},

abstract = {A Software Product Line (SPL) is a set of similar software systems that share a common set of features. Instead of building each product from scratch, SPL development takes advantage of the reusability of the core assets shared among the SPL members. In this work, we integrate performance analysis in the early phases of SPL development process, applying the same reusability concept to the performance annotations. Instead of annotating from scratch the UML model of every derived product, we propose to annotate the SPL model once with generic performance annotations. After deriving the model of a product from the family model by an automatic transformation, the generic performance annotations need to be bound to concrete product-specific values provided by the developer. Dealing manually with a large number of performance annotations, by asking the developer to inspect every diagram in the generated model and to extract these annotations is an error-prone process. In this paper we propose to automate the collection of all generic parameters from the product model and to present them to the developer in a user-friendly format (e.g., a spreadsheet per diagram, indicating each generic parameter together with guiding information that helps the user in providing concrete binding values). There are two kinds of generic parametric annotations handled by our approach: product-specific (corresponding to the set of features selected for the product) and platform-specific (such as device choices, network connections, middleware, and runtime environment). The following model transformations for (a) generating a product model with generic annotations from the SPL model, (b) building the spreadsheet with generic parameters and guiding information, and (c) performing the actual binding are all realized in the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL).},

abstract = {Software product lines (SPL) aim at reducing time-to-market and increasing software quality through extensive, planned reuse of artifacts. An essential activity in SPL is variability management, i.e., defining and managing commonality and variability among member products. Due to the large scale and complexity of today's software-intensive systems, variability management has become increasingly complex to conduct. Accordingly, tool support for variability management has been gathering increasing momentum over the last few years and can be considered a key success factor for developing and maintaining SPLs. While several studies have already been conducted on variability management, none of these analyzed the available tool support in detail. In this work, we report on a survey in which we analyzed 37 existing variability management tools identified using a systematic literature review to understand the tools’ characteristics, maturity, and the challenges in the field. We conclude that while most studies on variability management tools provide a good motivation and description of the research context and challenges, they often lack empirical data to support their claims and findings. It was also found that quality attributes important for the practical use of tools such as usability, integration, scalability, and performance were out of scope for most studies.},

abstract = {Feature toggles and configuration options are techniques to include or exclude functionality in software. The research contributions to these two techniques have most often been focused on either one of them. However, focusing on the similarities of these two techniques and the use of a common terminology may enable a combined family of research on software configuration (a term we use to encompass both techniques) and prevent duplication of effort. The goal of this study is to aid researchers in conducting a family of research on software configuration by extending an existing model of software configuration that provides a common terminology for feature toggles and configuration options in research studies. We started with Siegmund et al.’s Model of Software Configuration (MSC), which was developed based on configuration option-related resources. We extend the MSC by qualitative analysis of feature toggle-related resources. From our analysis, we proposed MSCv2 and evaluated it through its application on publications and an industrial system. Our results indicate researchers studying the same system may provide different definitions of software configuration in publications, similar research questions may be answered repeatedly because of a lack of a clear definition of software configuration, and having an MSC may enable generalized research on this family of research.},

abstract = {The Software Product Lines (SPL) paradigm has arisen for taking advantage of existing common aspects between different products, while also considering product-specific features. The architecture of a SPL comprises a model that will result in product architectures, and may include solutions leading to bad (architectural) design. One way to assess such design decisions is through the identification of architectural bad smells, which are properties that prejudice the overall software quality, but are not necessarily faulty or errant. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study that aims at characterizing bad smells in the context of product line architectures. We analyzed an open source SPL project and extracted its architecture to investigate the occurrence or absence of four smells initially studied in single systems. In addition, we propose a smell specific to the SPL context and discuss possible causes and implications of having those smells in the architecture of a product line. The results indicate that the granularity of the SPL features may influence on the occurrence of smells.},

abstract = {Customizable programs and program families provide user-selectable features to allow users to tailor a program to an application scenario. Knowing in advance which feature selection yields the best performance is difficult because a direct measurement of all possible feature combinations is infeasible. Our work aims at predicting program performance based on selected features. However, when features interact, accurate predictions are challenging. An interaction occurs when a particular feature combination has an unexpected influence on performance. We present a method that automatically detects performance-relevant feature interactions to improve prediction accuracy. To this end, we propose three heuristics to reduce the number of measurements required to detect interactions. Our evaluation consists of six real-world case studies from varying domains (e.g., databases, encoding libraries, and web servers) using different configuration techniques (e.g., configuration files and preprocessor flags). Results show an average prediction accuracy of 95%.},

abstract = {Variability in software-intensive systems is usually understood as the ability of a software artifact to be changed in order to fit different contexts, environments, or purposes. Software architecture on the other hand determines the structure of a software system, and is described in an architecture description. This description includes the major stakeholders of a software system and their concerns. Variability is reflected in and facilitated through the software architecture. The First International Workshop on Variability in Software Architecture (VARSA) was held jointly with WICSA 2011 in Boulder, Colorado. The goal of the workshop was to explore and advance the state-of-the art in variability in software architecture. It featured four research paper presentations, two invited talks, and three working groups that discussed specific topics. This report summarizes the themes of the workshop, presents the results of the working group discussions, and suggests topics for further research.},

abstract = {Product line engineering relies on heterogeneous models and artifacts to define and implement the product line's reusable assets. The complexity and heterogeneity of product line artifacts as well as their interdependencies make it hard to maintain consistency during development and evolution, regardless of the modeling approaches used. Engineers thus need support for detecting and resolving inconsistencies within and between the various artifacts. In this paper we present a framework for checking and maintaining consistency of arbitrary product line artifacts. Our approach is flexible and extensible regarding the supported artifact types and the definition of constraints. We discuss tool support developed for the DOPLER product line tool suite. We report the results of applying the approach to sales support applications of industrial product lines.},

abstract = {Due to dynamic variability, identifying the specific conditions under which non-functional requirements (NFRs) are satisfied may be only possible at runtime. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the dynamic treatment of relevant information during the requirements specifications. The associated data can be gathered by monitoring the execution of the application and its underlying environment to support reasoning about how the current application configuration is fulfilling the established requirements. This paper presents a dynamic decision-making infrastructure to support both NFRs representation and monitoring, and to reason about the degree of satisfaction of NFRs during runtime. The infrastructure is composed of: (i) an extended feature model aligned with a domain-specific language for representing NFRs to be monitored at runtime; (ii) a monitoring infrastructure to continuously assess NFRs at runtime; and (iii) a flexible decision-making process to select the best available configuration based on the satisfaction degree of the NRFs. The evaluation of the approach has shown that it is able to choose application configurations that well fit user NFRs based on runtime information. The evaluation also revealed that the proposed infrastructure provided consistent indicators regarding the best application configurations that fit user NFRs. Finally, a benefit of our approach is that it allows us to quantify the level of satisfaction with respect to NFRs specification.},

Despite a significant body of research on SECOs there is still a need to empirically investigate the characteristics of SECOs in specific industrial environments to understand and improve development processes. In particular, when defining software processes understanding the roles of the participants in the SECO is crucial. This paper thus reports results of an exploratory case study in the industrial automation domain. We explore two research questions on SECO characteristics and discuss research issues we derived from our analyses. While our study confirms key SECO characteristics reported in the literature we also identify additional properties relevant for development processes in the domain of industrial automation.},

abstract = {Architecture-centric development addresses the increasing complexity and variability of software systems by focusing on architectural models, which are generally easier to understand and manipulate than source code. It requires a mechanism that can maintain architecture-implementation conformance during architectural development and evolution. The challenge is twofold. There is an abstraction gap between software architecture and implementation, and both may evolve. Existing approaches are deficient in support for both change mapping and product line architecture. This article presents a novel approach named 1.x-way mapping and its extension, 1.x-line mapping to support architecture-implementation mapping in single system development and in product line development, respectively. They specifically address mapping architecture changes to code, maintaining variability conformance between product line architecture and code, and tracing architectural implementation. We built software tools named xMapper and xLineMapper to realize the two approaches, and conducted case studies with two existing open-source systems to evaluate the approaches. The result shows that our approaches are applicable to the implementation of a real software system and are capable of maintaining architecture-implementation conformance during system evolution.},

abstract = {We are delighted to welcome you to Melbourne, Australia for ACM Multimedia 2024, the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia. ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.For the first time since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's conference returns to the Asia-Pacific region and resumes as a full-fledged, inperson event. With no travel restrictions or significant visa challenges, we are excited to once again experience the warmth of face-to-face gatherings, where we can reconnect with colleagues and friends.The enthusiasm and support from the community have been incredible. ACM Multimedia 2024 received over 4,300 main conference submissions, accepting more than 1,100 papers (please refer to the TPC Chairs' message for details). In addition, 10 Grand Challenges were selected from 22 submissions, 18 workshops from 30 submissions, and 8 tutorials from 13 proposals. We've prepared an exciting five-day program: workshops, grand challenges, and tutorials will be held on the 1st and 5th days, with the main conference occupying the middle three days. All accepted papers will be accessible online prior to the conference, and we are working to ensure proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library around the conference period.This year's conference features three distinguished academic keynote speeches, several prestigious SIGMM award talks, a panel discussion on Generative AI in Multimedia, a refreshed Brave New Idea (BNI) session, and our inaugural industry program.The opening keynote will be delivered by Prof. Pascale Fung from HKUST, a Fellow of AAAI, ACL, and IEEE. Her talk will explore the pressing topic of Agents in the Large Language Model (LLM) Era. Prof. Judy Kay from the University of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous computing, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester, a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of Academia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will discuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program committee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to align with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionally, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks, and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclusive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multimedia 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM travel grants. Over 20 local students have also been recruited as volunteers, benefiting from complimentary registration. Furthermore, we have arranged childcare facilities to accommodate attendees with young children. A welcome reception will take place on the 2nd day of the conference, followed by a gala dinner on the 3rd day, featuring exciting cultural performances.We hope you find this year's program engaging and thought-provoking and that it offers valuable opportunities to exchange ideas with fellow researchers and practitioners from around the globe. We also encourage you to take time to explore the beautiful city of Melbourne and its surrounding regions.},
