abstract = {In the era of big data, data storage and computation have become a mainstream issue. Hadooop, as a distributed computing framework capable of handling large-scale datasets, the computing performance of its computing component MapReduce greatly affects the efficiency of big data processing. However, the current MapReduce computing component has the problem of uneven resource allocation during the Map computing phase. By analyzing the calculation process of MapReduce in the article, it is concluded that two main resource allocation parameters, mapreduce. task. io. sport. mb and mapreduce. map. sport. spool. percentage, affect the computational performance of the Map phase. Thus, a MapReduce resource allocation optimization algorithm MRAbF based on fairness strategy was proposed. By comparing the WordCount calculation experiment with the native MapReduce, the optimized MapReduce calculation performance can be improved by 4.8% to 17.2%.},

abstract = {Compilers are highly configurable systems. One can influence the performance of a compiled program by activating and deactivating selected compiler optimizations. However, automatically finding well-performing configurations is a challenging task. We consider expensive iteration, paired with recompilation of the program to optimize, as one of the main shortcomings of state-of-the-art approaches. Therefore, we propose Optimization Space Learning, a lightweight and noniterative technique. It exploits concepts known from configuration space learning and recommender systems to discover well-performing compiler configurations. This reduces the overhead induced by the approach significantly, compared to existing approaches. The process of finding a well-performing configuration is 800k times faster than with the state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {In this article, we investigate multi-agent techniques to install autonomy and adaptation in IoT-based smart environment settings, like smart home scenarios. We particularly make use of the smart environment configuration problem (SECP) framework, and map it to a distributed optimization problem (DCOP). This consists in enabling smart objects to coordinate and self-configure as to meet both user-defined requirements and energy efficiency, by operating a distributed constraint reasoning process over a computation graph. As to cope with the dynamics of the environment and infrastructure (e.g., by adding or removing devices), we also specify the k-resilient distribution of graph-structured computations supporting agent decisions, over dynamic and physical multi-agent systems. We implement a self-organizing distributed repair method, based on a distributed constraint optimization algorithm to adapt the distribution as to ensure the system still performs collective decisions and remains resilient to upcoming changes. We provide a full stack of mechanisms to install resilience in operating stateless DCOP solution methods, which results in a robust approach using a fast DCOP algorithm to repair any stateless DCOP solution methods at runtime. We experimentally evaluate the performances of these techniques when operating stateless DCOP algorithms to solve SECP instances.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Data-Driven Search-based Software Engineering (DSE), which combines insights from Mining Software Repositories (MSR) and Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE). While MSR formulates software engineering problems as data mining problems, SBSE reformulate Software Engineering (SE) problems as optimization problems and use meta-heuristic algorithms to solve them. Both MSR and SBSE share the common goal of providing insights to improve software engineering. The algorithms used in these two areas also have intrinsic relationships. We, therefore, argue that combining these two fields is useful for situations (a) which require learning from a large data source or (b) when optimizers need to know the lay of the land to find better solutions, faster.This paper aims to answer the following three questions: (1) What are the various topics addressed by DSE?, (2) What types of data are used by the researchers in this area?, and (3) What research approaches do researchers use? The paper briefly sets out to act as a practical guide to develop new DSE techniques and also to serve as a teaching resource.This paper also presents a resource (tiny.cc/data-se) for exploring DSE. The resource contains 89 artifacts which are related to DSE, divided into 13 groups such as requirements engineering, software product lines, software processes. All the materials in this repository have been used in recent software engineering papers; i.e., for all this material, there exist baseline results against which researchers can comparatively assess their new ideas.},

abstract = {Secure Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is becoming increasingly important with the ever-growing number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in our daily life. To achieve secure D2D communication, the key agreement between different IoT devices without any prior knowledge is becoming desirable. Although various approaches have been proposed in the literature, they suffer from a number of limitations, such as low key generation rate and short pairing distance. In this paper, we present InaudibleKey, an inaudible acoustic signal based key generation protocol for mobile devices. Based on acoustic channel reciprocity, InaudibleKey exploits the acoustic channel frequency response of two legitimate devices as a common secret to generating keys. InaudibleKey employs several novel technologies to significantly improve its performance. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed system in different real environments. Compared to state-of-the-art works, InaudibleKey improves key generation rate by 3 times, extends pairing distance by 3.2 times, and reduces information reconciliation counts by 2.5 times. Security analysis demonstrates that InaudibleKey is resilient to a number of malicious attacks. We also implement InaudibleKey on modern smartphones and resource-limited IoT devices. Results show that it is energy-efficient and can run on both powerful and resource-limited IoT devices without incurring excessive resource consumption.},

abstract = {This paper presents a low-power and miniaturized design for acoustic direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation and source localization, called Owlet. The required aperture, power consumption, and hardware complexity of the traditional array-based spatial sensing techniques make them unsuitable for small and power-constrained IoT devices. Aiming to overcome these fundamental limitations, Owlet explores acoustic microstructures for extracting spatial information. It uses a carefully designed 3D-printed metamaterial structure that covers the microphone. The structure embeds a direction-specific signature in the recorded sounds. Owlet system learns the directional signatures through a one-time in-lab calibration. The system uses an additional microphone as a reference channel and develops techniques that eliminate environmental variation, making the design robust to noises and multipaths in arbitrary locations of operations. Owlet prototype shows 3.6° median error in DoA estimation and 10cm median error in source localization while using a 1.5cm \texttimes{} 1.3cm acoustic structure for sensing. The prototype consumes less than 100th of the energy required by a traditional microphone array to achieve similar DoA estimation accuracy. Owlet opens up possibilities of low-power sensing through 3D-printed passive structures.},

abstract = {We are delighted to introduce the first volume of the ASPLOS proceedings for 2025. The conference is in its third year of an experiment with a three-deadline structure: authors can submit to any of three separate review cycles handled by a single year-long program committee. This volume includes papers from the first two review cycles, which had submission deadlines in the spring and summer of 2024. We combined the two cycles because submission volumes in the spring cycle were disproportionately small.This volume contains 72 of the 74 papers accepted to ASPLOS 2025 to date. This includes papers accepted in the spring and summer cycles and those invited to submit a revision in the spring cycle that was ultimately accepted. Two of these 74 accepted papers are still undergoing artifact evaluation and will be published in a subsequent volume. The spring and summer review cycles saw a combined 586 submissions. These submissions were reviewed by a 208-person Program Committee augmented by 57 External Review Committee members. On occasion, we solicited a small number of external expert reviews. On the PC, 129 members self-reported they were in an academic role and 77 self-reported they were in an industrial role. On the ERC it was 43 and 13 respectively. The median PhD year of the combined committees was 2014. In addition to these committees, we engaged ten vice chairs, experienced and trusted reviewers who helped us monitor the review process for each paper.These committees reviewed all of the submissions that were not desk rejected (11 papers) or withdrawn (4 papers). In keeping with recent norms, the technical review happened in two phases. Each paper received three reviews in the first round, with, in most cases, two additional reviews in the second round for the 54% of submissions that advanced. To assign reviews, we used the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to provide a preliminary review assignment that matched reviewer expertise. We then manually inspected and adjusted these assignments as needed: for example, to correct errors in TPMS's topic modeling or adjust to late-discovered conflicts. In addition, each paper was assigned a non-conflicted chair and a non-conflicted vice chair to provide two extra sets of eyes to monitor and facilitate the process. Due to the size and distribution of the PC, which spanned 14 time zones, the PC did not meet synchronously. Instead, each paper was discussed by the reviewers via comments in the HotCRP system. Ultimately, the discussion for each paper reached one of three outcomes: rejection, conditional acceptance, or major revision. All conditionally accepted papers were shepherded. Major revision papers were invited to revise and resubmit their paper for a second round of review by a subset of the original reviewers. All authors of papers that advanced to the second round of review were given the opportunity to see and respond to their reviewer questions prior to the reviewer discussion.},

To address these issues, we introduce variability-based model transformation. The key idea is to encode a set of similar rules into a compact representation, called variability-based rule. We provide an algorithm for applying such rules in an efficient manner. In addition, we introduce rule merging, a three-component mechanism for enabling the automatic creation of variability-based rules. Our rule application and merging mechanisms are supported by a novel formal framework, using category theory to provide precise definitions and to prove correctness. In two realistic application scenarios, the created variability-based rules enabled considerable speedups, while also allowing the overall specifications to become more compact.},

abstract = {We are delighted to welcome you to Melbourne, Australia for ACM Multimedia 2024, the 32nd ACM International Conference on Multimedia. ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.For the first time since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's conference returns to the Asia-Pacific region and resumes as a full-fledged, inperson event. With no travel restrictions or significant visa challenges, we are excited to once again experience the warmth of face-to-face gatherings, where we can reconnect with colleagues and friends.The enthusiasm and support from the community have been incredible. ACM Multimedia 2024 received over 4,300 main conference submissions, accepting more than 1,100 papers (please refer to the TPC Chairs' message for details). In addition, 10 Grand Challenges were selected from 22 submissions, 18 workshops from 30 submissions, and 8 tutorials from 13 proposals. We've prepared an exciting five-day program: workshops, grand challenges, and tutorials will be held on the 1st and 5th days, with the main conference occupying the middle three days. All accepted papers will be accessible online prior to the conference, and we are working to ensure proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library around the conference period.This year's conference features three distinguished academic keynote speeches, several prestigious SIGMM award talks, a panel discussion on Generative AI in Multimedia, a refreshed Brave New Idea (BNI) session, and our inaugural industry program.The opening keynote will be delivered by Prof. Pascale Fung from HKUST, a Fellow of AAAI, ACL, and IEEE. Her talk will explore the pressing topic of Agents in the Large Language Model (LLM) Era. Prof. Judy Kay from the University of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous computing, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester, a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of Academia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will discuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program committee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to align with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionally, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks, and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclusive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multimedia 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM travel grants. Over 20 local students have also been recruited as volunteers, benefiting from complimentary registration. Furthermore, we have arranged childcare facilities to accommodate attendees with young children. A welcome reception will take place on the 2nd day of the conference, followed by a gala dinner on the 3rd day, featuring exciting cultural performances.We hope you find this year's program engaging and thought-provoking and that it offers valuable opportunities to exchange ideas with fellow researchers and practitioners from around the globe. We also encourage you to take time to explore the beautiful city of Melbourne and its surrounding regions.},

abstract = {Kubernetes has emerged as a prominent open-source platform for managing cloud applications, including stateful databases. These monolithic applications rely on vertical scaling, adjusting CPU cores based on load fluctuations. However, our analysis of Kubernetes-based Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) offerings at Microsoft revealed that many customers consistently over-provision resources for peak workloads, neglecting cost-saving opportunities through resource scale-down. We found that there is a gap in the ability of existing vertical autoscaling tools to minimize resource slack and respond promptly to throttling, leading to increased costs and impacting crucial metrics such as throughput and availability.To address this challenge, we propose CaaSPER, a vertical autoscaling algorithm that blends reactive and proactive strategies. By dynamically adjusting CPU resources, CaaSPER minimizes resource slack, maintains optimal CPU utilization, and reduces throttling. Importantly, customers have the flexibility to prioritize either cost savings or high performance based on their preferences. Extensive testing demonstrates that CaaSPER effectively reduces throttling and keeps CPU utilization within target levels. CaaSPER is designed to be application-agnostic and platform-agnostic, with potential for extension to other applications requiring vertical autoscaling.},
