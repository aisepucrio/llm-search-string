abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) emerges for software organizations interested in customized products at reasonable costs. Based on the selection of features, stakeholders can derive programs satisfying a range of functional properties and non-functional ones. The explicit definition of Non-Functional Properties (NFP) during software configuration has been considered a challenging task. Dealing with them is not well established yet, neither in theory nor in practice. In this sense, we present a framework to specify NFP for SPLE and we also propose a reuse approach that promotes the reuse of NFP values during the product configuration. We discuss the results of a case study aimed to evaluate the applicability of the proposed work.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) engineering has emerged to provide the means to efficiently model, produce, and maintain multiple similar software variants, exploiting their common properties, and managing their variabilities (differences). With over two decades of existence, the community of SPL researchers and practitioners is thriving, as can be attested by the extensive research output and the numerous successful industrial projects. Education has a key role to support the next generation of practitioners to build highly complex, variability-intensive systems. Yet, it is unclear how the concepts of variability and SPLs are taught, what are the possible missing gaps and difficulties faced, what are the benefits, and what is the material available. Also, it remains unclear whether scholars teach what is actually needed by industry. In this article, we report on three initiatives we have conducted with scholars, educators, industry practitioners, and students to further understand the connection between SPLs and education, that is, an online survey on teaching SPLs we performed with 35 scholars, another survey on learning SPLs we conducted with 25 students, as well as two workshops held at the International Software Product Line Conference in 2014 and 2015 with both researchers and industry practitioners participating. We build upon the two surveys and the workshops to derive recommendations for educators to continue improving the state of practice of teaching SPLs, aimed at both individual educators as well as the wider community.},

abstract = {Dynamic software product lines demand self-adaptation of their behavior to deal with runtime contextual changes in their environment and offer a personalized product to the user. However, taking user preferences and context into account impedes the manual configuration process, and thus, an efficient and automated procedure is required. To automate the configuration process, context-aware recommendation techniques have been acknowledged as an effective mean to provide suggestions to a user based on their recognized context. In this work, we propose a collaborative filtering method based on tensor factorization that allows an integration of contextual data by modeling an N-dimensional tensor User-Feature-Context instead of the traditional two-dimensional User-Feature matrix. In the proposed approach, different types of non-functional properties are considered as additional contextual dimensions. Moreover, we show how to self-configure software product lines by applying our N-dimensional tensor factorization recommendation approach. We evaluate our approach by means of an empirical study using two datasets of configurations derived for medium-sized product lines. Our results reveal significant improvements in the predictive accuracy of the configuration over a state-of-the-art non-contextual matrix factorization approach. Moreover, it can scale up to a 7-dimensional tensor containing hundred of configurations in a couple of milliseconds.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are a mature approach for the derivation of a family of products using systematic reuse. Different combinations of predefined features enable tailoring the product to fit the needs of each customer. These needs are related to functional properties of the system (optional features) as well as non-functional properties (e.g., performance or cost of the final product). In industrial scenarios, the configuration process of a final product is complex and the tool support is usually limited to check functional properties interdependencies. In addition, the importance of nonfunctional properties as relevant drivers during configuration has been overlooked. Thus, there is a lack of holistic paradigms integrating recommendation systems and visualizations that can help the decision makers. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an interrelated set of visualizations for the configuration process filling these gaps. We integrate them as part of the FeatureIDE tool and we evaluate its effectiveness, scalability, and performance.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineers put a lot of effort to ensure that, through the setting of a large number of possible configuration options, products are acceptable and well-tailored to customers' needs. Unfortunately, options and their mutual interactions create a huge configuration space which is intractable to exhaustively explore. Instead of testing all products, machine learning is increasingly employed to approximate the set of acceptable products out of a small training sample of configurations. Machine learning (ML) techniques can refine a software product line through learned constraints and a priori prevent non-acceptable products to be derived. In this paper, we use adversarial ML techniques to generate adversarial configurations fooling ML classifiers and pinpoint incorrect classifications of products (videos) derived from an industrial video generator. Our attacks yield (up to) a 100% misclassification rate and a drop in accuracy of 5%. We discuss the implications these results have on SPL quality assurance.},

Despite various approaches to managing variability in SPLs, existing tools fall short of fully meeting industry needs, such as capturing non-functional requirements, modelling variability mechanisms, combining multiple tactics, maintaining traceability across features, tactics and assets, and ultimately, deriving products. The Bespoke project addresses these gaps by introducing a novel model-driven approach that transitions from Domain-Specific Modelling Language (DSML) to Feature Model (FM), allowing the integration of non-functional properties, and guiding products derivation with comprehensive tactics management. This solution is later validated through evaluation on a real-world SPL project focused on ageing. By leveraging existing tools and focusing on product derivation, this project aims to significantly improve code reuse and product derivation in SPLs, offering practical solutions for industry adoption.

Researchers have conducted many systematic studies on the different aspects of SPLs. To the best of our knowledge, till now there is no tertiary study conducted on systematic studies of SPL related research topics. In this paper, we aim at conducting a systematic mapping study of existing systematic studies to report the overview of the findings for researchers and practitioners. We performed snowballing and automated search to find out the relevant systematic studies. As a result, we analyzed 60 relevant studies to answer 5 research questions. The main focus of this tertiary study is to highlight the research topics, type of published reviews, active researchers and publication forums. Additionally, we highlight some of the limitations of the systematic studies. The important finding of this study is that the research field is well matured as the systematic studies covered a wide range of research topics. Another important finding is that many studies provided information for practitioners as well as researchers which is a notable improvement in the systematic reviews. However, many studies failed to assess the quality of the primary studies which is the major limitation of the existing systematic studies.},

abstract = {Software product lines (SPL) aim at reducing time-to-market and increasing software quality through extensive, planned reuse of artifacts. An essential activity in SPL is variability management, i.e., defining and managing commonality and variability among member products. Due to the large scale and complexity of today's software-intensive systems, variability management has become increasingly complex to conduct. Accordingly, tool support for variability management has been gathering increasing momentum over the last few years and can be considered a key success factor for developing and maintaining SPLs. While several studies have already been conducted on variability management, none of these analyzed the available tool support in detail. In this work, we report on a survey in which we analyzed 37 existing variability management tools identified using a systematic literature review to understand the tools’ characteristics, maturity, and the challenges in the field. We conclude that while most studies on variability management tools provide a good motivation and description of the research context and challenges, they often lack empirical data to support their claims and findings. It was also found that quality attributes important for the practical use of tools such as usability, integration, scalability, and performance were out of scope for most studies.},

abstract = {Many approaches to software product line engineering have been founded on the development of a single product line platform. However as customer requirements change and new products are added to the product line, software producers recognize that the platform cannot be "stretched" indefinitely and a significant problem is striking a balance between development efficiency by increasing platform commonality and customer dissatisfaction from products with additional undesirable features and properties.One alternative is to develop multiple product lines (MPLs). However the challenge remains about what to include in a multiple product line platform. Drawing upon industrial experience of working with 4 companies, this paper explores the characteristics of the contexts in which MPLs are a viable alternative development strategy and then proposes a framework of approaches to platform development.},

abstract = {A configurable system is characterized by the configuration options present or absent in its variants. Selecting and deselecting those configuration options directly influences the functional properties of the system. Apart from functional properties, there are system characteristics that influence the performance (e.g., power demand), safety (e.g., fault probabilities), and security (e.g., susceptibility to attacks) of the system, called Non-Functional Properties (NFPs). Knowledge of NFPs is crucial for evaluating a system’s feasibility, usability, and resource demands. Although variability influences these characteristics, NFPs do not compose linearly for every selected feature. Feature interactions can increase the overall NFP values through (potentially exponential) amplification or decrease them through mitigation effects. In this paper, we propose an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict NFP values for new configurations based on previously measured configuration values. Using AutoML, we leverage the advantages of machine learning for predicting NFPs without having to parameterize and fine-tune machine learning models. This approach and the resulting pipeline aim to reduce the complexity of performance prediction for configurable systems. We test the feasibility of our pipeline in a first evaluation on 4 real-world subject systems and discuss cases where AutoML may improve the prediction of NFPs.},

abstract = {Modern software systems must fulfill the needs of an ever-growing customer base. Due to the innate diversity of human needs, software should be highly customizable and reconfigurable. Researchers and practitioners gained interest in software product lines (SPL), mimicking aspects of product lines in industrial production for the engineering of highly-variable systems. There are two main approaches towards the engineering of SPLs. The first uses macros---such as the #ifdef macro in C. The second---called feature-oriented programming (FOP)---uses variability-aware preprocessors called composers to generate a program variant from a set of features and a configuration. Both approaches have disadvantages. Most notably, these approaches are usually not supported by the base language; for instance Java is one of the most commonly used FOP languages among researchers, but it does not support macros rather it relies on the C preprocessor or a custom one to translate macros into actual Java code. As a result, developers must struggle to keep up with the evolution of the base language, hindering the general applicability of SPL engineering. Moreover, to effectively evolve a software configuration and its features, their location must be known. The problem of recording and maintaining traceability information is considered expensive and error-prone and it is once again handled externally through dedicated modeling languages and tools. Instead, to properly convey the FOP paradigm, software features should be treated as first-class citizens using concepts that are proper to the host language, so that the variability can be expressed and analyzed with the same tools used to develop any other software in the same language. In this paper, we present a simple and flexible design pattern for JVM-based languages---dubbed devise pattern---that can be used to express feature dependencies and behaviors with a light-weight syntax both at domain analysis and at domain implementation level. To showcase the qualities and feasibility of our approach, we present several variability-aware implementations of a MNIST-encoder---including one using the devise pattern---and compare strengths and weaknesses of each approach.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is a compelling methodology that accomplishes systematic reuse in families of systems by relying on two key principles: (i) the decomposition of complex systems into composable and reusable building blocks (often logical units called features), and (ii) on-demand construction of products and product variants by composing these building blocks.However, unless the stakeholder responsible for product configuration has detailed knowledge of the technical ins and outs of the software product line (e.g., the architectural impact of a specific feature, or potential feature interactions), he is in many cases flying in the dark. Although many initial approaches and techniques have been proposed that take into account quality considerations and involve trade-off decisions during product configuration, no systematic support exists.In this paper, we present a reference architecture for product configuration tooling, providing support for (i) up-front generation of variants, and (ii) quality analysis of these variants. This allows pro-actively assessing and predicting architectural quality properties for each product variant and in turn, product configuration tools can take into account architectural considerations. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of techniques and tactics for dealing with the problem of variant explosion, and as such to maintain practical feasibility of such approaches.We validated and implemented our reference architecture in the context of a real-world industrial application, a product-line for the firmware of an automotive sensor. Our prototype, based on FeatureIDE, is open for extension and readily available.},

Software Product Lines (SPLs) address this trend by describing a family of software products that share a common set of features. However, choosing the appropriate set of features that matches a user's individual interests is hampered due to the overwhelming amount of possible SPL configurations. Recommender systems can address this challenge by filtering the number of configurations and suggesting a suitable set of features for the user's requirements. In this paper, we propose a context-aware recommender system for predicting feature selections in an extended SPL configuration scenario, i.e. taking nonfunctional properties of features into consideration. We present an empirical evaluation based on a large real-world dataset of configurations derived from industrial experience in the Enterprise Resource Planning domain. Our results indicate significant improvements in the predictive accuracy of our context-aware recommendation approach over a state-of-the-art binary-based approach.},

abstract = {Creating and managing valid configurations is one of the main tasks in software product line engineering. Due to the often complex constraints from a feature model, some kind of automated configuration generation is required to facilitate the configuration process for users and developers. For instance, decision propagation can be applied to support users in configuring a product from a software product line (SPL) with less manual effort and error potential, leading to a semi-automatic configuration process. Furthermore, fully-automatic configuration processes, such as random sampling or t-wise interaction sampling can be employed to test or to optimize an SPL. However, current techniques for automated configuration generation still do not scale well to SPLs with large and complex feature models. Within our thesis, we identify current challenges regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of the semi- and fully-automatic configuration process and aim to address these challenges by introducing novel techniques and improving current ones. Our preliminary results show already show promising progress for both, the semi- and fully-automatic configuration process.},

We present an analysis of the topics covered by academic vs. industry research and discuss the evolution of these topics and their relation over the years.

abstract = {The colossal solution spaces of most configurable systems make intractable their exhaustive exploration. Accordingly, relevant analyses remain open research problems. There exist analyses alternatives such as SAT solving or constraint programming. However, none of them have explored simulation-based methods. Monte Carlo-based decision making is a simulation-based method for dealing with colossal solution spaces using randomness. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that tackles various of those analyses using Monte Carlo methods, which have proven to succeed in vast search spaces (e.g., game theory). Our general framework is described formally, and its flexibility to cope with a diversity of analysis problems is discussed (e.g., finding defective configurations, feature model reverse engineering or getting optimal performance configurations). Additionally, we present a Python implementation of the framework that shows the feasibility of our proposal. With this contribution, we envision that different problems can be addressed using Monte Carlo simulations and that our framework can be used to advance the state of the art a step forward.},

abstract = {A number of product-line analysis approaches lift analyses such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving from the level of single programs to the level of product lines. These approaches share concepts and mechanisms that suggest an unexplored potential for reuse of key analysis steps and properties, implementation, and verification efforts. Despite the availability of taxonomies synthesizing such approaches, there still remains the underlying problem of not being able to describe product-line analyses and their properties precisely and uniformly. We propose a formal framework that models product-line analyses in a compositional manner, providing an overall understanding of the space of family-based, feature-based, and product-based analysis strategies. It defines precisely how the different types of product-line analyses compose and inter-relate. To ensure soundness, we formalize the framework, providing mechanized specification and proofs of key concepts and properties of the individual analyses. The formalization provides unambiguous definitions of domain terminology and assumptions as well as solid evidence of key properties based on rigorous formal proofs. To qualitatively assess the generality of the framework, we discuss to what extent it describes five representative product-line analyses targeting the following properties: safety, performance, dataflow facts, security, and functional program properties.},

abstract = {Feature models are arguably one of the most intuitive and successful notations for modeling the features of a variant-rich software system. Feature models help developers to keep an overall understanding of the system, and also support scoping, planning, development, variant derivation, configuration, and maintenance activities that sustain the system's long-term success. Unfortunately, feature models are difficult to build and evolve. Features need to be identified, grouped, organized in a hierarchy, and mapped to software assets. Also, dependencies between features need to be declared. While feature models have been the subject of three decades of research, resulting in many feature-modeling notations together with automated analysis and configuration techniques, a generic set of principles for engineering feature models is still missing. It is not even clear whether feature models could be engineered using recurrent principles. Our work shows that such principles in fact exist. We analyzed feature-modeling practices elicited from ten interviews conducted with industrial practitioners and from 31 relevant papers. We synthesized a set of 34 principles covering eight different phases of feature modeling, from planning over model construction, to model maintenance and evolution. Grounded in empirical evidence, these principles provide practical, context-specific advice on how to perform feature modeling, describe what information sources to consider, and highlight common characteristics of feature models. We believe that our principles can support researchers and practitioners enhancing feature-modeling tooling, synthesis, and analyses techniques, as well as scope future research.},

abstract = {Efficient configuration management system is crucial for the success of any software product line (SPL). Due to ever changing needs of customers, SPL undergoes constant changes that are to be tracked in real time. In the context of customer-driven development, anticipation and change management are to be given paramount importance. It demands implementation of software variability that drives home changed, extended and customized configurations besides economy at scale. Moreover, the emergence of distributed technologies, the unprecedented growth of component based, serviceoriented systems throw ever increasing challenges to software product line configuration management. Derivation of a new product is a dynamic process in software product line that should consider functionality and quality attributes. Very few approaches are found on configuration management (CM) of SPL though CM is enough matured for traditional products. They are tailor made and inadequate to provide a general solution. Stated differently, a comprehensive approach for SPL configuration management and product derivation is still to be desired. In this paper, we proposed a framework that guides in doing so besides helping in SPL definitions in generic way. Our framework facilitates SPL configuration management and product derivation based on critical path analysis, weight computation and feedback. We proposed two algorithms namely Quality Driven Product Derivation (QDPD) and Composition Analysis algorithm for generating satisfied compositions and to find best possible composition respectively. The usage of weights and critical path analysis improves quality of product derivation. The framework is extensible and flexible thus it can be leveraged with variability-aware design patterns and ontology. We built a prototype that demonstrates the proof of concept. We tested our approach with Dr. School product line. The results reveal that the framework supports configuration management of SPL and derivation of high quality product in the product line. We evaluated results with ground truth to establish significance of our implementation},

abstract = {Cardinality-based feature models permit to select multiple copies of the same feature, thus generalizing the notion of product configurations from subsets of Boolean features to multisets of feature instances. This increased expressiveness shapes a-priori infinite and non-convex configuration spaces, which renders established solution-space mappings based on Boolean presence conditions insufficient for cardinality-based feature models. To address this issue, we propose weighted automata over featured multiset semirings as a novel behavioral variability modeling formalism for cardinality-based feature models. The formalism uses multisets over features as a predefined semantic domain for transition weights. It permits to use any algebraic structure forming a proper semiring on multisets to aggregate the weights traversed along paths to map accepted words to multiset configurations. In particular, tropical semirings constitute a promising sub-class with a reasonable trade-off between expressiveness and computational tractability of canonical analysis problems. The formalism is strictly more expressive than featured transition systems, as it enables upper-bound multiplicity constraints depending on the length of words. We provide a tool implementation of the behavioral variability model and present preliminary experimental results showing applicability and computational feasibility of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Variability-rich software, such as software product lines, offers optional and alternative features to accommodate varying needs of users. Designers of variability-rich software face the challenge of reasoning about the impact of selecting such features on the quality attributes of the resulting software variant. Attributed feature models have been proposed to model such features and their impact on quality attributes, but existing variability modelling languages and tools have limited or no support for such models and the complex multi-objective optimization problem that arises. This paper presents ClaferMoo, a language and tool that addresses these shortcomings. ClaferMoo uses type inheritance to modularize the attribution of features in feature models and allows specifying multiple optimization goals. We evaluate an implementation of the language on a set of attributed feature models from the literature, showing that the optimization infrastructure can handle small-scale feature models with about a dozen features within seconds.},

The non-functional requirements are often informally defined and their management does not provide traceability mechanisms for their validation. In this paper, we present a multimodel approach that allows the explicit representation of non-functional requirements for software product lines both at domain engineering, and application engineering levels. The multimodel allows the representation of different viewpoints of a software product line, including the non-functional requirements and the relationships that these non-functional requirements might have with features and functionalities. The feasibility of this approach is illustrated through a specific example from the automotive domain.},

abstract = {Though variability is everywhere, there has always been a shortage of publicly available cases for assessing variability-aware tools and techniques as well as supports for teaching variability-related concepts. Historical software product lines contains industrial secrets their owners do not want to disclose to a wide audience. The open source community contributed to large-scale cases such as Eclipse, Linux kernels, or web-based plugin systems (Drupal, WordPress). To assess accuracy of sampling and prediction approaches (bugs, performance), a case where all products can be enumerated is desirable. As configuration issues do not lie within only one place but are scattered across technologies and assets, a case exposing such diversity is an additional asset. To this end, we present in this paper our efforts in building an explicit product line on top of JHipster, an industrial open-source Web-app configurator that is both manageable in terms of configurations (≈ 163,000) and diverse in terms of technologies used. We present our efforts in building a variability-aware chain on top of JHipster's configurator and lessons learned using it as a teaching case at the University of Rennes. We also sketch the diversity of analyses that can be performed with our infrastructure as well as early issues found using it. Our long term goal is both to support students and researchers studying variability analysis and JHipster developers in the maintenance and evolution of their tools.},

A number of systematic literature reviews exist that identify the main characteristics offered by existing tools and the SPL phases in which they can be applied. However, these reviews do not really help to understand if those tools are offering what is really needed to apply SPLs to complex projects. These studies are mainly based on information extracted from the tool documentation or published papers. In this paper, we follow a different approach, in which we firstly identify those characteristics that are currently essential for the development of an SPL, and secondly analyze whether the tools provide or not support for those characteristics. We focus on those tools that satisfy certain selection criteria (e.g., they can be downloaded and are ready to be used). The paper presents a state of practice with the availability and usability of the existing tools for SPL, and defines different roadmaps that allow carrying out a complete SPL process with the existing tool support.},

abstract = {Today’s competitive marketplace requires the industry to understand unique and particular needs of their customers. Product line practices enable companies to create individual products for every customer by providing an interdependent set of features. Users configure personalized products by consecutively selecting desired features based on their individual needs. However, as most features are interdependent, users must understand the impact of their gradual selections in order to make valid decisions. Thus, especially when dealing with large feature models, specialized assistance is needed to guide the users in configuring their product. Recently, recommender systems have proved to be an appropriate mean to assist users in finding information and making decisions. In this paper, we propose an advanced feature recommender system that provides personalized recommendations to users. In detail, we offer four main contributions: (i) We provide a recommender system that suggests relevant features to ease the decision-making process. (ii) Based on this system, we provide visual support to users that guides them through the decision-making process and allows them to focus on valid and relevant parts of the configuration space. (iii) We provide an interactive open-source configurator tool encompassing all those features. (iv) In order to demonstrate the performance of our approach, we compare three different recommender algorithms in two real case studies derived from business experience.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is one of the main techniques used in Software Product Line Engineering to manage the variability within the products of a family. Concrete products of the family can be generated through a configuration process. The configuration process selects and/or removes features from the feature model according to the stakeholders' requirements. Selecting the right set of features for one product from amongst all of the available features in the feature model is a complex task because: 1) the multiplicity of stakeholders' functional requirements; 2) the positive or negative impact of features on non-functional properties; and 3) the stakeholders' preferences w.r.t. the desirable non-functional properties of the final product. Many configurations techniques have already been proposed to facilitate automated product derivation. However, most of the current proposals are not designed to consider stakeholders' preferences and constraints especially with regard to non-functional properties. We address the software product line configuration problem and propose a framework, which employs an artificial intelligence planning technique to automatically select suitable features that satisfy both the stakeholders' functional and non-functional preferences and constraints. We also provide tooling support to facilitate the use of our framework. Our experiments show that despite the complexity involved with the simultaneous consideration of both functional and non-functional properties our configuration technique is scalable.},

abstract = {The specialization of the configuration space of a software system has been considered for targeting specific configuration profiles, usages, deployment scenarios, or hardware settings. The challenge is to find constraints among options' values that only retain configurations meeting a performance objective. Since the exponential nature of configurable systems makes a manual specialization unpractical, several approaches have considered its automation using machine learning, i.e., measuring a sample of configurations and then learning what options' values should be constrained. Even focusing on learning techniques based on decision trees for their built-in explainability, there is still a wide range of possible approaches that need to be evaluated, i.e., how accurate is the specialization with regards to sampling size, performance thresholds, and kinds of configurable systems. In this paper, we compare six learning techniques: three variants of decision trees (including a novel algorithm) with and without the use of model-based feature selection. We first perform a study on 8 configurable systems considered in previous related works and show that the accuracy reaches more than 90% and that feature selection can improve the results in the majority of cases. We then perform a study on the Linux kernel and show that these techniques performs as well as on the other systems. Overall, our results show that there is no one-size-fits-all learning variant (though high accuracy can be achieved): we present guidelines and discuss tradeoffs.},

Multiple product variants are represented in a product line, however the selection of a particular configuration depends on stakeholders' functional and non-functional requirements. Methods like constraint programming and evolutionary algorithms have been used to support the configuration process. They consider a set of product requirements like resource constraints, stakeholders' preferences, and optimization objectives. Nevertheless, scalability and performance concerns start to be an issue when facing large-scale product lines and runtime environments. Thus, this paper presents a survey that analyses strengths and drawbacks of 21 approaches that support product line configuration. This survey aims to: i) evidence which product requirements are currently supported by studied methods; ii) how scalability and performance is considered in existing approaches; and iii) point out some challenges to be addressed in future research.},

abstract = {Live Training Transformation (LT2) is the product line strategy put in place by the United States Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI). The purpose of the LT2 product line is to provide a common set of core assets including architectures, software components, standards and processes that form the basis of all Army Live Training systems. As products consuming LT2 core assets evolve to meet the latest requirements of the military live training community, changes to the core product line architecture must also be made. Based on thorough analysis of the LT2 core capabilities and user trends toward web-enabled and mobile computing technologies, a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) strategy was identified and adopted as the objective architecture for the evolving LT2 product line. Future success of the LT2 product line now depends on the alignment of product line engineering concepts with the business and technical benefits of SOA, and to ensure that systematic reuse continues to provide substantial return-on-investment for the Army. This paper addresses the challenges of adopting SOA into an existing software product line, the unique circumstances of the LT2 SOA environment, and present a set of analysis and design considerations for the product line engineering community.},

abstract = {Architecture-centric development addresses the increasing complexity and variability of software systems by focusing on architectural models, which are generally easier to understand and manipulate than source code. It requires a mechanism that can maintain architecture-implementation conformance during architectural development and evolution. The challenge is twofold. There is an abstraction gap between software architecture and implementation, and both may evolve. Existing approaches are deficient in support for both change mapping and product line architecture. This article presents a novel approach named 1.x-way mapping and its extension, 1.x-line mapping to support architecture-implementation mapping in single system development and in product line development, respectively. They specifically address mapping architecture changes to code, maintaining variability conformance between product line architecture and code, and tracing architectural implementation. We built software tools named xMapper and xLineMapper to realize the two approaches, and conducted case studies with two existing open-source systems to evaluate the approaches. The result shows that our approaches are applicable to the implementation of a real software system and are capable of maintaining architecture-implementation conformance during system evolution.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity of embedded systems leads to the development of variable software, such as software product lines. From such a family of programs, stakeholders select the specific variant that satisfies their functional requirements. However, different functionality exposes different non-functional properties of these variants. Especially in the embedded-system domain, non-functional requirements are vital, because resources are scarce. Hence, when selecting an appropriate variant, we have to fulfill also non-functional requirements. Since more systems are interconnected, the challenge is to find a variant that additionally satisfies global nonfunctional (or quality) requirements. In this paper, we advert the problem of achieving interoperability of non-functional requirements among multiple interacting systems using a real-world scenario. Furthermore, we show an approach to find optimal variants for multiple systems that reduces computation effort by means of a stepwise configuration process.},

From recent works on product properties resulting from configurations and the optimisation of these properties, one comes quickly to more complex challenges such as multi-objective optimisation, conflicting objectives, multiple stakeholders, and conflict resolution. The intuition is that Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) can draw from other disciplines that deal with decision spaces and complex decision scenarios.Objectives. We aim to (1) explore links to such disciplines, (2) systematise and compare concepts, and (3) identify opportunities, where SPLE approaches can be enriched.Method. We undertake an exploratory study: Starting from common SPLE activities and artefacts, we identify aspects where we expect to find corresponding counterparts in other disciplines. We focus on Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO), and Design Space Exploration (DSE), and perform a comparison of the key concepts.Results. The resulting comparison relates SPLE activities and artefacts to concepts from MCDA, MOO, and DSE and identifies areas where SPLE approaches can be enriched. We also provide examples of existing work at the intersections of SPLE with the other fields. These findings are aimed to foster the conversation on research opportunities where SPLE can draw techniques from other disciplines dealing with complex decision scenarios.},

However, this is hard to achieve because energy-saving functions often depend on the hardware, and operating systems. The diversity of hardware components and operating systems makes the implementation time consuming and difficult. We propose an approach to automate energy optimization of programs by implementing energy-saving functionality as modular, separate implementation units (e.g., feature modules or aspects). These units are bundled as energy features into an energy-optimization feature library. Based on aspect-oriented and feature-oriented programming, we discuss different techniques to compose the source code of a client program and the implementation units of the energy features.},

The transformation may provide the basis for new functionalities or improve or maintain non-functional properties in order to match the application better to its operational requirements and standards. Software Product Line Engineering has rich methods and techniques in variability modeling and management which is one of the main issues in developing self-adaptive systems. Dynamic software product lines (DSPL) have been proposed to exploit the knowledge acquired in SPLE to develop self-adaptive software systems.In this tutorial, we portray the problem of developing self-adaptive systems. Then we investigate how the idea of dynamic software product line could help to deal with the challenges that we face in developing efficient self-adaptive software. We also offer insight into the different approaches that use dynamic software product line engineering for developing self-adaptive systems focusing on practical approaches by showing how the approaches are applied to real case studies and also methods for evaluating these approaches. This tutorial also discuss how DSPL could be used some relevant areas to self-adaptive systems and challenges which still exist in the area.},

abstract = {Product Derivation is a key activity in Software Product Line Engineering. During this process, derivation operators modify or create core assets (e.g., model elements, source code instructions, components) by adding, removing or substituting them according to a given configuration. The result is a derived product that generally needs to conform to a programming or modeling language. Some operators lead to invalid products when applied to certain assets, some others do not; knowing this in advance can help to better use them, however this is challenging, specially if we consider assets expressed in extensive and complex languages such as Java. In this paper, we empirically answer the following question: which product line operators, applied to which program elements, can synthesize variants of programs that are incorrect, correct or perhaps even conforming to test suites? We implement source code transformations, based on the derivation operators of the Common Variability Language. We automatically synthesize more than 370,000 program variants from a set of 8 real large Java projects (up to 85,000 lines of code), obtaining an extensive panorama of the sanity of the operations.},

Resource restrictions and heterogeneity of hardware, however, complicate the development of data management solutions for those systems. In current practice, this typically leads to the redevelopment of data management because existing solutions cannot be reused and adapted appropriately. In this paper, we present our ongoing work on FAME-DBMS, a research project that explores techniques to implement highly customizable data management solutions, and illustrate how such systems can be created with a software product line approach. With this approach a concrete instance of a DBMS is derived by composing features of the DBMS product line that are needed for a specific application scenario. This product derivation process is getting complex if a large number of features is available. Furthermore, in embedded systems also non-functional properties, e.g., memory consumption, have to be considered when creating a DBMS instance. To simplify the derivation process we present approaches for its automation.},

abstract = {Handling configurable systems with thousands of configuration options is a challenging problem in research and industry. One of the most common approaches to manage the configuration options of large systems is variability modelling. The verification and configuration process of large variability models is manually infeasible. Hence, they are usually assisted by automated analyses based on solving satisfiability problems (SAT). Recent advances in satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) could prove SMT solvers as a viable alternative to SAT solvers. However, SMT solvers are typically not utilized for variability analyses. A comparison for SAT and SMT could help to estimate SMT solvers potential for the automated analysis. We integrated two SMT solvers into FeatureIDE and compared them against a SAT solver on analyses for feature models, configurations, and realization artifacts. We give an overview of all variability analyses in FeatureIDE and present the results of our empirical evaluation for over 122 systems. We observed that SMT solvers are generally faster in generating explanations of unsatisfiable requests. However, the evaluated SAT solver outperformed SMT solvers for other analyses.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of software systems which share a common sets of feature and are developed through common set of core assets in order to promotes software reusability, mass customization, reducing cost, time-to-market and improving the quality of the product. SPLs are sets (i.e., families) of software applications developed as a whole for a specific business domain. Particular applications are derived from software families by selecting the desired features through configuration process. Traditionally, SPLs are implemented with systematically developed components, shared by members of the SPLs and reused every time a new application is derived. In this paper, we propose an approach to the development and configuration of Service-Oriented SPLs in which services are used as reusable assets and building blocks of implementation. Our proposed approach also suggests prioritization of family features according to stakeholder's non-functional requirements (NFRs) and preferences. Priorities of NFRs are used to filter the most important features of the family, which is performed by Stratified Analytic Hierarchical Process (S-AHP). The priorities also are used further for the selection of appropriate services implementation for business processes realizing features. We apply Mixed Integer Linear Programming to find the optimal service selection within the constraints boundaries specified by stakeholders.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is a paradigm that advocates the reusability of software engineering assets and the rapid development of new applications for a target domain. These objectives are achieved by capturing the commonalities and variabilities between the applications of a target domain and through the development of comprehensive and variability-covering domain models. The domain models developed within the software product line development process need to cover all of the possible features and aspects of the target domain. In other words, the domain models often described using feature models should be elaborate representations of the feature space of that domain. In order to operationalize feature-based representations of a software application, appropriate implementation mechanisms need to be employed. In this paper, we propose a Semantic Web-oriented language, called Semantic Annotations for Feature Modeling Description Language (SAFMDL) that provides the means to semantically describe feature models. We will show that using SAFMDL along with Semantic Web Query techniques, we are able to bridge the gap between software product lines and SOA technology. Our proposed work allows software practitioners to use Semantic Web technology to quickly and rapidly develop new software products based on SOA technology from software product lines.},

abstract = {Variability in software systems is a key concept in mastering complexity. Most software systems exhibit functionalities that can either be implemented in several different ways or may be options that can be chosen late in their design, depending on the deployment conditions. Expressing these forms of variability attracted a lot of attention since several years, leading to a predominant expression media: Feature models. Feature models can express the mandatory/optional status of a feature, as well as alternative realizations of a feature, exclusive of each others or not. Though extensions of feature models have been proposed to express more properties, they are still limited in their ability to capture complex configuration problems, especially those involving extra functional properties. Lines of research have proposed extended feature models with non-functional attributes and constraint-solving approach to reason about them. Yet, these approaches appear too restrictive and inflexible to cater for really complex SPL. In this paper, we rather propose to extend feature models with conditional preferences concepts from the multi-criteria decision-making field, and more specifically on relationships introduced in the graphical modeling approach of the * CP-net family of models. We show how these new relationships enable the expression of complex configuration constraints, while ensuring that the feature models remain intuitive and user-friendly across various feature model analysis-based activities.},

The factory product line goes hand-in-hand with the product line of the products to be manufactured.

abstract = {Feature toggles and configuration options are techniques to include or exclude functionality in software. The research contributions to these two techniques have most often been focused on either one of them. However, focusing on the similarities of these two techniques and the use of a common terminology may enable a combined family of research on software configuration (a term we use to encompass both techniques) and prevent duplication of effort. The goal of this study is to aid researchers in conducting a family of research on software configuration by extending an existing model of software configuration that provides a common terminology for feature toggles and configuration options in research studies. We started with Siegmund et al.’s Model of Software Configuration (MSC), which was developed based on configuration option-related resources. We extend the MSC by qualitative analysis of feature toggle-related resources. From our analysis, we proposed MSCv2 and evaluated it through its application on publications and an industrial system. Our results indicate researchers studying the same system may provide different definitions of software configuration in publications, similar research questions may be answered repeatedly because of a lack of a clear definition of software configuration, and having an MSC may enable generalized research on this family of research.},

abstract = {Automation systems in industry are often software-intensive systems consisting of software and hardware components. During their development several engineers of different disciplines are involved, such as mechanical, electrical and software engineering. Each engineer focuses on specific system aspects to be developed. To enable an efficient development, product lines especially with feature models for variability modeling are promising technologies. In order to reduce the complexity of both feature models and development process, views on feature models can be applied. The use of views for filtering purposes constitutes an established method. However, views also enable further options missing in current approaches, such as evaluations regarding requirements, including non-functional ones. This paper presents an approach for evaluation across multiple views to enable collaborative development for developers who focus on different system aspects. We validate our approach by applying it in an industrial project for the planning of flying saws.},

abstract = {Kconfig is the de facto configuration language for describing and configuring the variability of the Linux kernel. Nonetheless, it has been used since the early stages of kernel development. Moreover, Kconfig is also used as a niche configuration languages, such as microkernel compilation for air navigation systems, proprietary routers or embedded systems. In the last decade, the software product line (SPL) community worked intensively on observing Linux Kernel and Kconfig. However, the official documentation is difficult to understand, and the examples are long and challenging to synthesize for non-Kconfig experts, such as SPL engineers, and researchers. In this paper, we propose a Kconfig metamodel based on the documentation and the feedback of a kernel developer expert. Thanks to this metamodel, the design of transformations from Kconfig to other variability models such as UVL (Universal Variability Language) can be facilitated. To our knowledge, this is the first proposal for a metamodel of the Kconfig language. This opens the door to further research, such as Kconfig analysis and transformations, and leverage interoperability among the Kconfig toolchain and SPL tools.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) engineering is a software development approach that takes advantage of the commonality and variability between products from a family, and supports the generation of specific products by reusing a set of core family assets. This paper proposes a UML model transformation approach for software product lines to derive a performance model for a specific product. The input to the proposed technique, the "source model", is a UML model of a SPL with performance annotations, which uses two separate profiles: a "product line" profile from literature for specifying the commonality and variability between products, and the MARTE profile recently standardized by OMG for performance annotations. The source model is generic and therefore its performance annotations must be parameterized. The proposed derivation of a performance model for a concrete product requires two steps: a) the transformation of a SPL model to a UML model with performance annotations for a given product, and b) the transformation of the outcome of the first step into a performance model. This paper focuses on the first step, whereas the second step will use the PUMA transformation approach of annotated UML models to performance models, developed in previous work. The output of the first step, named "target model", is a UML model with MARTE annotations, where the variability expressed in the SPL model has been analyzed and bound to a specific product, and the generic performance annotations have been bound to concrete values for the product. The proposed technique is illustrated with an e-commerce case study.},

abstract = {With the rise of containerization, cloud development, and continuous integration and delivery, configuration has become an essential aspect not only to tailor software to user requirements, but also to configure a software system’s environment and infrastructure. This heterogeneity of activities, domains, and processes blurs the term configuration, as it is not clear anymore what tasks, artifacts, or stakeholders are involved and intertwined. However, each re- search study and each paper involving configuration places their contributions and findings in a certain context without making the context explicit. This makes it difficult to compare findings, translate them to practice, and to generalize the results. Thus, we set out to evaluate whether these different views on configuration are really distinct or can be summarized under a common umbrella. By interviewing practitioners from different domains and in different roles about the aspects of configuration and by analyzing two qualitative studies in similar areas, we derive a model of configuration that provides terminology and context for research studies, identifies new research opportunities, and allows practitioners to spot possible challenges in their current tasks. Although our interviewees have a clear view about configuration, it substantially differs due to their personal experience and role. This indicates that the term configuration might be overloaded. However, when taking a closer look, we see the interconnections and dependencies among all views, arriving at the conclusion that we need to start considering the entire spectrum of dimensions of configuration.},

abstract = {A widespread business model in cloud computing is to offer software as a service (SaaS) over the Internet. Such applications are often multi-tenant aware, which means that multiple tenants share hardware and software resources of the same application instance. However, SaaS stakeholders have different or even contradictious requirements and interests: For a user, the application's quality and non-functional properties have to be maximized (e.g., choosing the fastest available algorithm for a computation at runtime). In contrast, a resource or application provider is interested in minimizing the operating costs while maximizing his profit. Finally, tenants are interested in offering a customized functionality to their users. To identify an optimal compromise for all these objectives, multiple levels of variability have to be supported by reference architectures for multi-tenant SaaS applications. In this paper, we identify requirements for such a runtime architecture addressing the individual interests of all involved stakeholders. Furthermore, we show how our existing architecture for dynamically adaptive applications can be extended for the development and operation of multi-tenant applications.},

abstract = {The variability of a software product line (SPL)is often described with a feature model. To avoid highly complex models, stakeholders usually try to separate different variability dimensions, such as domain variability and implementation variability. This results in distinct variability models, which are easier to handle than one large model. On the other hand, it is sometimes required to analyze the variability dimensions of an SPL in combination using a single model only. To combine separate modeling and integrated analysis of variability, we present Velvet, a language for multi-dimensional variability modeling. Velvet allows stakeholders to model each variability dimension of an SPL separately and to compose the separated dimensions on demand. This improves reuse of feature models and supports independent modeling variability dimensions. Furthermore, Velvet integrates feature modeling and configuration in a single language. The combination of both concepts creates further reuse opportunities and allows stakeholders to independently configure variability dimensions.},

abstract = {Due to dynamic variability, identifying the specific conditions under which non-functional requirements (NFRs) are satisfied may be only possible at runtime. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the dynamic treatment of relevant information during the requirements specifications. The associated data can be gathered by monitoring the execution of the application and its underlying environment to support reasoning about how the current application configuration is fulfilling the established requirements. This paper presents a dynamic decision-making infrastructure to support both NFRs representation and monitoring, and to reason about the degree of satisfaction of NFRs during runtime. The infrastructure is composed of: (i) an extended feature model aligned with a domain-specific language for representing NFRs to be monitored at runtime; (ii) a monitoring infrastructure to continuously assess NFRs at runtime; and (iii) a flexible decision-making process to select the best available configuration based on the satisfaction degree of the NRFs. The evaluation of the approach has shown that it is able to choose application configurations that well fit user NFRs based on runtime information. The evaluation also revealed that the proposed infrastructure provided consistent indicators regarding the best application configurations that fit user NFRs. Finally, a benefit of our approach is that it allows us to quantify the level of satisfaction with respect to NFRs specification.},

Current approaches focus on avoiding such conflicts, applying the mutual exclusion principle. However, this perspective has a negative impact on users satisfaction, who cannot make any decision fairly. In this work, we propose an interpretation of multi-user configuration as a game theoretic problem. Game theory is a well-known discipline which analyzes conflicts and cooperation among intelligent rational decision-makers. We present a taxonomy of multi-user configuration approaches, and how they can be interpreted as different problems of game theory. We focus on cooperative game theory to propose and automate a tradeoff-based bargaining approach, as a way to solve the conflicts and maximize user satisfaction at the same time.},

abstract = {Multi-tenancy is a key pillar of cloud services. It allows different tenants to share computing resources transparently and, at the same time, guarantees substantial cost savings for the providers. However, from a user perspective, one of the major drawbacks of multi-tenancy is lack of configurability. Depending on the isolation degree, the same service instance and even the same service configuration may be shared among multiple tenants (i.e. shared multi-tenant service). Moreover tenants usually have different - and in most of the cases - conflicting configuration preferences. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel approach to support user-centric adaptation in shared multi-tenant services. The adaptation objective aims to maximise tenants’ satisfaction, even when tenants and their preferences change during the service life-time. This paper describes how to engineer the activities of the MAPE loop to support user-centric adaptation, and focuses on the analysis of tenants’ preferences. In particular, we use a game theoretic analysis to identify a service configuration that maximises tenants’ preferences satisfaction. We illustrate and motivate our approach by utilising a multi-tenant desktop scenario. Obtained experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed analysis.},

Different application areas, such as enterprise resource planning, mobile devices, telecommunications, and so on, require different and specialized platforms. Many of them offer their services using standardized interface technologies to support integration with the applications built on top of them and with other platforms. The diversity of platform technologies and interfaces, however, renders the integration of multiple platforms challenging. In this paper, we discuss design alternatives for tailoring heterogeneous service platforms by studying high-level and low-level architectural design decisions for integrating and for adapting platforms. We survey and organize existing patterns and design decisions in the literature as a pattern language. With this pattern language, we address the various decision categories and interconnections for the service-based integration and the adaptation of applications developed based on software platforms. We apply this pattern language in an industry case study.},

abstract = {It is common for organizations to maintain multiple variants of a given business process, such as multiple sales processes for different products or multiple bookkeeping processes for different countries. Conventional business process modeling languages do not explicitly support the representation of such families of process variants. This gap triggered significant research efforts over the past decade, leading to an array of approaches to business process variability modeling. In general, each of these approaches extends a conventional process modeling language with constructs to capture customizable process models. A customizable process model represents a family of process variants in a way that a model of each variant can be derived by adding or deleting fragments according to customization options or according to a domain model. This survey draws up a systematic inventory of approaches to customizable process modeling and provides a comparative evaluation with the aim of identifying common and differentiating modeling features, providing criteria for selecting among multiple approaches, and identifying gaps in the state of the art. The survey puts into evidence an abundance of customizable process-modeling languages, which contrasts with a relative scarcity of available tool support and empirical comparative evaluations.},
