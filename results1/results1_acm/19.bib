abstract = {Modern high-performance applications are highly-configurable systems that provide hundreds of configuration options. Performance models offer insights into the performance of these applications and help users understand the impact of these options. Yet, crafting models for such applications proves costly due to the many configuration options and their unknown performance impacts that need to be modeled. However, some options are performance-irrelevant, and removing them can reduce construction costs without compromising accuracy. This paper explores an approach to automatically identify performance-irrelevant configuration options empirically. By leveraging established performance modeling methods, we devise cost-efficient preliminary prediction models that rely on fewer samples and analyze them to identify such options. We evaluate our approach using a real-world HPC application to demonstrate our method's effectiveness in recognizing performance-irrelevant options and the potential to save costs for performance modeling.},

abstract = {A key challenge of the development and maintenance of configurable systems is to predict the performance of individual system variants based on the features selected. It is usually infeasible to measure the performance of all possible variants, due to feature combinatorics. Previous approaches predict performance based on small samples of measured variants, but it is still open how to dynamically determine an ideal sample that balances prediction accuracy and measurement effort. In this paper, we adapt two widely-used sampling strategies for performance prediction to the domain of configurable systems and evaluate them in terms of sampling cost, which considers prediction accuracy and measurement effort simultaneously. To generate an initial sample, we introduce a new heuristic based on feature frequencies and compare it to a traditional method based on t-way feature coverage. We conduct experiments on six real-world systems and provide guidelines for stakeholders to predict performance by sampling.},

abstract = {Most software systems provide options that allow users to tailor the system in terms of functionality and qualities. The increased flexibility raises challenges for understanding the configuration space and the effects of options and their interactions on performance and other non-functional properties. To identify how options and interactions affect the performance of a system, several sampling and learning strategies have been recently proposed. However, existing approaches usually assume a fixed environment (hardware, workload, software release) such that learning has to be repeated once the environment changes. Repeating learning and measurement for each environment is expensive and often practically infeasible. Instead, we pursue a strategy that transfers knowledge across environments but sidesteps heavyweight and expensive transfer-learning strategies. Based on empirical insights about common relationships regarding (i) influential options, (ii) their interactions, and (iii) their performance distributions, our approach, L2S (Learning to Sample), selects better samples in the target environment based on information from the source environment. It progressively shrinks and adaptively concentrates on interesting regions of the configuration space. With both synthetic benchmarks and several real systems, we demonstrate that L2S outperforms state of the art performance learning and transfer-learning approaches in terms of measurement effort and learning accuracy.},

abstract = {Context: Many software systems are highly configurable. Different configuration options could lead to varying performances of the system. It is difficult to measure system performance in the presence of an exponential number of possible combinations of these options.Goal: Predicting software performance by using a small configuration sample.Method: This paper proposes Perf-AL to address this problem via adversarial learning. Specifically, we use a generative network combined with several different regularization techniques (L1 regularization, L2 regularization and a dropout technique) to output predicted values as close to the ground truth labels as possible. With the use of adversarial learning, our network identifies and distinguishes the predicted values of the generator network from the ground truth value distribution. The generator and the discriminator compete with each other by refining the prediction model iteratively until its predicted values converge towards the ground truth distribution.Results: We argue that (i) the proposed method can achieve the same level of prediction accuracy, but with a smaller number of training samples. (ii) Our proposed model using seven real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. This help to further promote software configurable performance.Conclusion: Experimental results on seven public real-world datasets demonstrate that PERF-AL outperforms state-of-the-art software performance prediction methods.},

With this understanding, stakeholders can debug performance behavior and make deliberate configuration decisions. Current black-box techniques to build such models combine various sampling and learning strategies, resulting in tradeoffs between measurement effort, accuracy, and interpretability. We present Comprex, a white-box approach to build performance-influence models for configurable systems, combining insights of local measurements, dynamic taint analysis to track options in the implementation, compositionality, and compression of the configuration space, without relying on machine learning to extrapolate incomplete samples. Our evaluation on 4 widely-used, open-source projects demonstrates that Comprex builds similarly accurate performance-influence models to the most accurate and expensive black-box approach, but at a reduced cost and with additional benefits from interpretable and local models.},

abstract = {Almost every complex software system today is configurable. While configurability has many benefits, it challenges performance prediction, optimization, and debugging. Often, the influences of individual configuration options on performance are unknown. Worse, configuration options may interact, giving rise to a configuration space of possibly exponential size. Addressing this challenge, we propose an approach that derives a performance-influence model for a given configurable system, describing all relevant influences of configuration options and their interactions. Our approach combines machine-learning and sampling heuristics in a novel way. It improves over standard techniques in that it (1) represents influences of options and their interactions explicitly (which eases debugging), (2) smoothly integrates binary and numeric configuration options for the first time, (3) incorporates domain knowledge, if available (which eases learning and increases accuracy), (4) considers complex constraints among options, and (5) systematically reduces the solution space to a tractable size. A series of experiments demonstrates the feasibility of our approach in terms of the accuracy of the models learned as well as the accuracy of the performance predictions one can make with them.},

abstract = {Many software systems provide users with a set of configuration options and different configurations may lead to different runtime performance of the system. As the combination of configurations could be exponential, it is difficult to exhaustively deploy and measure system performance under all possible configurations. Recently, several learning methods have been proposed to build a performance prediction model based on performance data collected from a small sample of configurations, and then use the model to predict system performance under a new configuration. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model highly configurable software system using a deep feedforward neural network (FNN) combined with a sparsity regularization technique, e.g. the L1 regularization. Besides, we also design a practical search strategy for automatically tuning the network hyperparameters efficiently. Our method, called DeepPerf, can predict performance values of highly configurable software systems with binary and/or numeric configuration options at much higher prediction accuracy with less training data than the state-of-the art approaches. Experimental results on eleven public real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Software systems provide user-relevant configuration options called features. Features affect functional and non-functional system properties, whereas selections of features represent system configurations. A subset of configuration space forms a Pareto frontier of optimal configurations in terms of multiple properties, from which a user can choose the best configuration for a particular scenario. However, when a well-studied system is redeployed on a different hardware, information about property value and the Pareto frontier might not apply. We investigate whether it is possible to transfer this information across heterogeneous hardware environments. We propose a methodology for approximating and transferring Pareto frontiers of configurable systems across different hardware environments. We approximate a Pareto frontier by training an individual predictor model for each system property, and by aggregating predictions of each property into an approximated frontier. We transfer the approximated frontier across hardware by training a transfer model for each property, by applying it to a respective predictor, and by combining transferred properties into a frontier. We evaluate our approach by modeling Pareto frontiers as binary classifiers that separate all system configurations into optimal and non-optimal ones. Thus we can assess quality of approximated and transferred frontiers using common statistical measures like sensitivity and specificity. We test our approach using five real-world software systems from the compression domain, while paying special attention to their performance. Evaluation results demonstrate that accuracy of approximated frontiers depends linearly on predictors' training sample sizes, whereas transferring introduces only minor additional error to a frontier even for small training sizes.},

While the ill effects of misconfiguration or improper resource allocation are well-known, there are no effective a priori metrics to quantify the impact of the configuration on the desired system attributes such as performance, availability, etc. In this paper, we propose a Configuration Health Index (CHI) framework specifically attuned to the performance attribute to capture the influence of CVs on the performance aspects of the system. We show how CHI, which is defined as a configuration scoring system, can take advantage of the domain knowledge and the available (but rather limited) performance data to produce important insights into the configuration settings. We compare the CHI with both well-advertised segmented non-linear models and state-of-the-art data-driven models, and show that the CHI not only consistently provides better results but also avoids the dangers of a pure data drive approach which may predict incorrect behavior or eliminate some essential configuration variables from consideration.},

abstract = {Many modern software systems are highly configurable, allowing the user to tune them for performance and more. Current performance modeling approaches aim at finding performance-optimal configurations by building performance models in a black-box manner. While these models provide accurate estimates, they cannot pinpoint causes of observed performance behavior to specific code regions. This does not only hinder system understanding, but it also complicates tracing the influence of configuration options to individual methods.We propose a white-box approach that models configuration-dependent performance behavior at the method level. This allows us to predict the influence of configuration decisions on individual methods, supporting system understanding and performance debugging. The approach consists of two steps: First, we use a coarse-grained profiler and learn performance-influence models for all methods, potentially identifying some methods that are highly configuration- and performance-sensitive, causing inaccurate predictions. Second, we re-measure these methods with a fine-grained profiler and learn more accurate models, at higher cost, though. By means of 9 real-world Java software systems, we demonstrate that our approach can efficiently identify configuration-relevant methods and learn accurate performance-influence models.},

abstract = {Modern software systems are built to be used in dynamic environments using configuration capabilities to adapt to changes and external uncertainties. In a self-adaptation context, we are often interested in reasoning about the performance of the systems under different configurations. Usually, we learn a black-box model based on real measurements to predict the performance of the system given a specific configuration. However, as modern systems become more complex, there are many configuration parameters that may interact and we end up learning an exponentially large configuration space. Naturally, this does not scale when relying on real measurements in the actual changing environment. We propose a different solution: Instead of taking the measurements from the real system, we learn the model using samples from other sources, such as simulators that approximate performance of the real system at low cost. We define a cost model that transform the traditional view of model learning into a multi-objective problem that not only takes into account model accuracy but also measurements effort as well. We evaluate our cost-aware transfer learning solution using real-world configurable software including (i) a robotic system, (ii) 3 different stream processing applications, and (iii) a NoSQL database system. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve (a) a high prediction accuracy, as well as (b) a high model reliability.},

abstract = {Uncertainty is particularly critical in software performance engineering when it relates to the values of important parameters such as workload, operational profile, and resource demand, because such parameters inevitably affect the overall system performance. Prior work focused on monitoring the performance characteristics of software systems while considering influence of configuration options. The problem of incorporating uncertainty as a first-class concept in the software development process to identify performance issues is still challenging. The PLUS (Performance Learning for Uncertainty of Software) approach aims at addressing these limitations by investigating the specification of a new class of performance models capturing how the different uncertainties underlying a software system affect its performance characteristics. The main goal of PLUS is to answer a fundamental question in the software performance engineering domain: How to model the variable configuration options (i.e., software and hardware resources) and their intrinsic uncertainties (e.g., resource demand, processor speed) to represent the performance characteristics of software systems? This way, software engineers are exposed to a quantitative evaluation of their systems that supports them in the task of identifying performance critical configurations along with their uncertainties.},
