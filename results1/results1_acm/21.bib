abstract = {Within software product lines, customers may have different quality needs. To produce products with purposefully different quality attributes, several challenges must be addressed. First, one must be able to distinguish product quality attributes to the customers in a meaningful way. Second, one must create the desired quality attribute differences during product-line architecture design and derivation. To study how performance is varied purposefully in software product lines, we conducted a comparison and re-analysis of two industrial case studies in the telecommunication and mobile game domains. The results show that performance variants must be communicated to the customer in a way that links to customer value and her role. When performance or its adaptation are crucial for the customer, performance differences must be explicitly "designed in" with software or hardware means. Due to the emergent nature of performance, it is important to test performance and manage how other variability affects performance.},

abstract = {Structure-based cohesion metrics, such as the well-known Chidamber and Kemerer's Lack of Cohesion in Methods (LCOM), fail to capture the semantic notion of a software component's cohesion. Some researchers claim that it is one of the reasons they are not good indicators of change proneness. The Lack of Concern-based Cohesion metric (LCC) is an alternative cohesion metric which is centered on counting the number of concerns a component implements. A concern is any important concept, feature, property or area of interest of a system that we want to treat in a modular way. In this way, LCC focus on what really matters for assessing a component's cohesion - the amount of responsibilities placed on them. Our aim in this paper is to present an initial investigation about the applicability of this concern-based cohesion metric as a change proneness indicator. We also checked if this metric has a correlation with efferent coupling. An initial empirical assessment work was done with two small to medium-sized systems. Our results indicated a moderate to strong correlation between LCC and change proneness, and also a strong correlation between LCC and efferent coupling.},

abstract = {Background. This article describes a case study on the benefits of software reuse in a large telecom product. The reused components were developed in-house and shared in a product-family approach. Methods. Quantitative data mined from company repositories are combined with other quantitative data and qualitative observations. Results. We observed significantly lower fault density and less modified code between successive releases of the reused components. Reuse and standardization of software architecture and processes allowed easier transfer of development when organizational changes happened. Conclusions. The study adds to the evidence of quality benefits of large-scale reuse programs and explores organizational motivations and outcomes.},
