    title: Selecting Discrete and Continuous Features Based on Neighborhood Decision Error Minimization
    abstract: —Feature selection plays an important role in pattern recognition and machine learning. Feature evaluation and classification complexity estimation arise as key issues in the construction of selection algorithms. To estimate classification complexity in different feature subspaces, a novel feature evaluation measure, called the neighborhood decision error rate (NDER), is proposed, which is applicable to both categorical and numerical features. We first introduce a neighborhood rough-set model to divide the sample set into decision positive regions and decision boundary regions. Then, the samples that fall within decision boundary regions are further grouped into recognizable and misclassified subsets based on class probabilities that occur in neighborhoods. The percentage of misclassified samples is viewed as the estimate of classification complexity of the corresponding feature subspaces. We present a forward greedy strategy for searching the feature subset, which minimizes the NDER and, correspondingly, minimizes the classification complexity of the selected feature subset. Both theoretical and experimental comparison with other feature selection algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm is effective for discrete and continuous features, as well as their mixture.

In this paper, we classify network traffic by using the PCA technique together with six machine learning algorithms — Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 1-Nearest Neighbor (NN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and H2O. We analyze the impact of PCA through classifying the data set by each algorithm with and without PCA.

The computational time is also considered in analysis phase. Our results show that Random Forest and NN are the top two algorithms among the six. Specifically, both of them behave well in classification under the most cases of input sets regardless of applying PCA. Lastly, PCA significantly boosts NN algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and shortens the classification time for Random Forest.

    title: "An extensible framework for software configuration optimization on
    heterogeneous computing systems: Time and energy case study"
    abstract: Context: Application of component based software engineering methods to heterogeneous computing (HC) enables different software configurations to realize the same function with different non–functional properties (NFP). Finding the best software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs is a non–trivial task. Objective: We propose a Software Component Allocation Framework (SCAF) with the goal to acquire a (sub–) optimal software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs, thus providing performance prediction of a software configuration in its early design phase. We focus on the software configuration optimization for the average energy consumption and average execution time. Method: We validated SCAF through its instantiation on a real–world demonstrator and a simulation. Firstly, we verified the correctness of our model through comparing the performance prediction of six software configurations to the actual performance, obtained through extensive measurements with a confidence interval of 95%. Secondly, to demonstrate how SCAF scales up, we performed software configuration optimization on 55 generated use–cases (with solution spaces ranging from 1030 to 3070) and benchmark the results against best performing random configurations. Results: The performance of a configuration as predicted by our framework matched the configuration implemented and measured on a real–world platform. Furthermore, by applying the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to the weight function given in SCAF, we obtain sub–optimal software configurations differing in performance at most 7% and 13% from the optimal configuration (respectfully). Conclusion: SCAF is capable of correctly describing a HC platform and reliably predict the performance of software configuration in the early design phase. Automated in the form of an Eclipse plugin, SCAF allows software architects to model architectural constraints and preferences, acting as a multi–criterion software architecture decision support system. In addition to said, we also point out several interesting research directions, to further investigate and improve our approach.

Group the keywords into clusters using a semantic proximity criterion.
Ensure that the clusters contain coherently related terms, where each cluster should represent a specific topic.
Search String Assembly:
Connect the terms within each cluster using OR.
Connect the clusters with each other using AND.
Simulated Refinement:
Imagine that the extracted terms were used to search for relevant articles.
Generate a new list of keywords based on how the terms could be expanded to capture more relevant articles.
Build a second version of the search string, expanded with suggested terms.
Final Adjustment:
Present the generated string and the identified clusters.
Expected Output:
Present the final search string in boolean format.
    

    title: "An extensible framework for software configuration optimization on
    heterogeneous computing systems: Time and energy case study"
    abstract: Context: Application of component based software engineering methods to heterogeneous computing (HC) enables different software configurations to realize the same function with different non–functional properties (NFP). Finding the best software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs is a non–trivial task. Objective: We propose a Software Component Allocation Framework (SCAF) with the goal to acquire a (sub–) optimal software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs, thus providing performance prediction of a software configuration in its early design phase. We focus on the software configuration optimization for the average energy consumption and average execution time. Method: We validated SCAF through its instantiation on a real–world demonstrator and a simulation. Firstly, we verified the correctness of our model through comparing the performance prediction of six software configurations to the actual performance, obtained through extensive measurements with a confidence interval of 95%. Secondly, to demonstrate how SCAF scales up, we performed software configuration optimization on 55 generated use–cases (with solution spaces ranging from 1030 to 3070) and benchmark the results against best performing random configurations. Results: The performance of a configuration as predicted by our framework matched the configuration implemented and measured on a real–world platform. Furthermore, by applying the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to the weight function given in SCAF, we obtain sub–optimal software configurations differing in performance at most 7% and 13% from the optimal configuration (respectfully). Conclusion: SCAF is capable of correctly describing a HC platform and reliably predict the performance of software configuration in the early design phase. Automated in the form of an Eclipse plugin, SCAF allows software architects to model architectural constraints and preferences, acting as a multi–criterion software architecture decision support system. In addition to said, we also point out several interesting research directions, to further investigate and improve our approach.
    
Answer:Here is the generated search string:

"(software configuration optimization OR component allocation framework) AND (heterogeneous computing systems OR non-functional properties) AND (energy consumption OR execution time) AND (performance prediction OR software architecture decision support system)"

Note: The clusters are identified as follows:
Cluster 1: Software Configuration Optimization, Component Allocation Framework
Cluster 2: Heterogeneous Computing Systems, Non-Functional Properties
Cluster 3: Energy Consumption, Execution Time, Performance Prediction

The search string is constructed by connecting the terms within each cluster using OR and connecting the clusters with each other using AND.
