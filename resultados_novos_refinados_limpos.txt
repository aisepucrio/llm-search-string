After searching with the extracted terms, the following new list of keywords is generated to expand the search string:

* To capture more relevant articles on optimization of non-functional properties in SPLs:
	+ Optimization techniques (e.g., genetic algorithms, simulated annealing)
	+ Performance metrics (e.g., response time, throughput)
	+ Energy efficiency
	+ Footprint reduction
	+ Variability management
* To focus on the application domains mentioned in the abstract:
	+ Database management systems
	+ Operating systems

The second version of the search string is:

("software product lines" OR "SPL engineering") AND ("non-functional properties" OR "optimization goals") AND ((genetic algorithms OR simulated annealing) OR (performance metrics OR response time OR throughput) OR energy efficiency OR footprint reduction OR variability management OR database management systems OR operating systems)

Final search string:
