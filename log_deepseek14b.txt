    network architecture for both selection and classifreation
    tasks. 
    
Answer:<think>
Okay, so I need to generate an academic search string based on the provided title and abstract. Let me start by understanding what the article is about.

The title is "Input Sample Selection for RBF Neural Network Classification Problems Using Sensitivity Measure." So the main topics here are Input Sample Selection, RBF Neural Networks, and Sensitivity Measures in the context of classification problems.

Looking at the abstract: It discusses how large datasets with irrelevant or redundant samples can reduce learning performance and increase costs. The authors compare various sample selection and active learning techniques and propose a new method using the stochastic radial basis function neural network sensitivity measure (Sw). They tested this on the UCI MLR dataset, achieving significant results—removing 99% of data while maintaining 92% classification accuracy. Their approach uses the same RBFNN architecture for both selection and classification.

So, to create a search string, I should focus on key terms that capture these elements: Input Sample Selection, RBF Neural Networks, Sensitivity Measures, Classification, Feature Selection, Active Learning, and maybe something about efficiency or dataset reduction.

I want the search string to be as specific as possible but still broad enough to retrieve relevant articles. Combining terms like "input sample selection," "RBF neural network," "sensitivity measure," "classification," "feature selection," and "data reduction" could effectively capture similar research.

Putting it all together, a possible search string would include these key phrases. I should use Boolean operators (AND, OR) to combine them appropriately. Maybe start with the most specific terms first: RBF Neural Network AND Input Sample Selection AND Sensitivity Measure. Then add related terms like Classification, Feature Selection, Active Learning, Data Reduction.

Let me structure it:

("Input sample selection" OR "sample selection") AND ("RBF neural network" OR "radial basis function network") AND ("sensitivity measure" OR "feature selection") AND (classification OR "data reduction")

I think that covers the main aspects. Using quotation marks for exact phrases to ensure precision, and ORs to include synonyms or related terms.

    title: Analysis of Machine Learning Techniques for Context Extraction
    abstract: "’Context is key’ conveys the importance of capturing the
    digital environment of a knowledge worker. Knowing the
    user’s context offers various possibilities for support, like
    for example enhancing information delivery or providing
    work guidance. Hence, user interactions have to be aggregated and mapped to predefined task categories. Without
    machine learning tools, such an assignment has to be done
    manually. The identification of suitable machine learning
    algorithms is necessary in order to ensure accurate and
    timely classification of the user’s context without inducing
    additional workload.
    This paper provides a methodology for recording user interactions and an analysis of supervised classification models, feature types and feature selection for automatically detecting the current task and context of a user. Our analysis
    is based on a real world data set and shows the applicability
    of machine learning techniques."
    
Answer:<think>
Alright, let me try to figure out how to generate the right search string for this query. The title is about analyzing machine learning techniques for context extraction, so I know that's the main topic. The abstract talks about using machine learning algorithms to classify user interactions into predefined task categories. They mention supervised classification models and feature types.

So, I need a search string that captures all these elements. It should include terms related to machine learning, context extraction, maybe task classification or interaction analysis. Also, the methodology they used involves analyzing real-world datasets, so including words like "analysis" or "methodology" might help. 

I should combine keywords like "machine learning techniques", "context extraction", and possibly "user interactions". Maybe add terms like "supervised classification models" to be more specific. But I don't want the string to be too long. Let me try putting it together:

"Machine Learning Techniques Context Extraction Task Classification"

That seems to cover all the main points without being redundant. It includes the primary focus areas from both the title and abstract.

    title: Selecting Discrete and Continuous Features Based on Neighborhood Decision Error Minimization
    abstract: —Feature selection plays an important role in pattern recognition and machine learning. Feature evaluation and classification complexity estimation arise as key issues in the construction of selection algorithms. To estimate classification complexity in different feature subspaces, a novel feature evaluation measure, called the neighborhood decision error rate (NDER), is proposed, which is applicable to both categorical and numerical features. We first introduce a neighborhood rough-set model to divide the sample set into decision positive regions and decision boundary regions. Then, the samples that fall within decision boundary regions are further grouped into recognizable and misclassified subsets based on class probabilities that occur in neighborhoods. The percentage of misclassified samples is viewed as the estimate of classification complexity of the corresponding feature subspaces. We present a forward greedy strategy for searching the feature subset, which minimizes the NDER and, correspondingly, minimizes the classification complexity of the selected feature subset. Both theoretical and experimental comparison with other feature selection algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm is effective for discrete and continuous features, as well as their mixture.
    
Answer:<think>
Okay, so I need to create an academic search string based on the given title and abstract. The title is about selecting discrete and continuous features using a neighborhood decision error minimization approach. The abstract mentions feature selection, pattern recognition, machine learning, NDER (neighborhood decision error rate), classification complexity, rough-set model, forward greedy strategy, and comparisons with other algorithms.

First, I'll break down the key terms from the title and abstract. The main topics are "feature selection" since that's central to both. It specifically talks about discrete and continuous features, so including those terms would be good. The method used is neighborhood decision error minimization, which should definitely be part of the search string.

Looking at the abstract, important concepts include "neighborhood rough-set model," "classification complexity estimation," and "forward greedy strategy." These terms are crucial for pinpointing relevant literature. Also, since the paper deals with both types of features (discrete and continuous), including those ensures that the search captures all related studies.

I should also consider synonyms or related terms. For example, "feature evaluation" is mentioned, which could be another keyword to include. Terms like "pattern recognition," "machine learning," and "algorithm" might also be relevant as they are broader fields where feature selection is applied.

Putting it all together, I want the search string to cover the specific method (neighborhood decision error minimization), the types of features involved, the evaluation measure (NDER), and the strategies used. Maybe combining these terms with Boolean operators like "AND" or using parentheses for phrase matching can make the search more effective.

I need to ensure that the search string is concise but comprehensive enough to retrieve all relevant articles. It shouldn't be too broad, so including specific terms like "neighborhood decision error minimization," "discrete and continuous features," and "feature selection" should help in narrowing down the results effectively.
</think>

(feature selection AND (discrete OR continuous features)) AND (neighborhood decision error minimization OR NDER) AND ("rough set model" OR classification complexity estimation OR forward greedy strategy) AND (pattern recognition OR machine learning)

This search string is designed to capture articles that specifically address feature selection in the context of both discrete and continuous features, utilizing neighborhood decision error minimization or its equivalent measure. It also includes related methodologies such as rough set models, classification complexity estimation, and forward greedy strategies within the broader fields of pattern recognition and machine learning.

    title: Comprehensive Analysis of Network Traffic Data
    abstract: With the large volume of network traffic flow, it is necessary to preprocess raw data before classification to gain the accurate results speedily. Feature selection is an essential approach in preprocessing phase. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is recognized as an effective and efficient method. In this paper, we classify network traffic by using the PCA technique together with six machine learning algorithms — Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 1-Nearest Neighbor (NN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and H2O. We analyze the impact of PCA through classifying the data set by each algorithm with and without PCA. Experiments are set out by varying the size of input data sets, and the performances are measured from two metrics including overall accuracy and Fmeasure. The computational time is also considered in analysis phase. Our results show that Random Forest and NN are the top two algorithms among the six. Specifically, both of them behave well in classification under the most cases of input sets regardless of applying PCA. Lastly, PCA significantly boosts NN algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and shortens the classification time for Random Forest.
    
Answer:<think>
Alright, so I need to generate a search string based on the title and abstract provided. The title is "Comprehensive Analysis of Network Traffic Data." From that, I can tell it's about analyzing network traffic, which falls under data analysis in computer science or cybersecurity.

Looking at the abstract, the main focus seems to be on feature selection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for preprocessing network traffic data before classification. They used six machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 1-Nearest Neighbor (NN), Random Forest, SVM, and H2O. The study evaluates the impact of PCA on these algorithms' performance in terms of accuracy, F-measure, and computational time.

So, to create a search string that captures all relevant aspects, I should include keywords related to network traffic analysis, feature selection with PCA, machine learning algorithms used, and possibly performance metrics like classification accuracy. 

I'll start by including "Network Traffic Data" since that's the core topic. Then, since they mention preprocessing and feature selection, adding "Feature Selection" makes sense. The paper specifically uses PCA, so I should include "Principal Component Analysis." They evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms, so terms like "Machine Learning Algorithms," "Classification Algorithms," or more specific ones like "Naive Bayes" might be good to add.

However, considering the search string needs to be concise and just one, I need to pick keywords that are broad enough to capture all relevant articles but specific enough to avoid irrelevant results. Including too many specific algorithms might limit the scope, so perhaps sticking with broader terms is better.

Putting it all together, a possible search string could be: "Network Traffic Data Classification using Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms." But I can make it more concise by removing "using" and maybe adding "Performance Analysis" since they discussed metrics like accuracy and computational time.

Alternatively, including "Feature Selection" might also be beneficial as it's part of the preprocessing they mentioned. So a refined version could be: "Network Traffic Feature Selection with PCA for Machine Learning Classification."

Wait, but in the abstract, they specifically used PCA together with those algorithms, so maybe including both PCA and machine learning terms is essential.

I think the most comprehensive single search string would include all key elements: Network Traffic Data, PCA (Principal Component Analysis), and the machine learning aspect. So combining these, it might be "Network traffic data analysis using Principal Component Analysis and machine learning classification."

But to make it more precise, I can structure it as a title, so perhaps "Comprehensive Analysis of Network Traffic Data Using Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning." That captures the comprehensive angle mentioned in the title.

Alternatively, since they did feature selection with PCA for classification, another approach is "Network traffic classification using Principal Component Analysis and machine learning algorithms."

But I think the most effective string combines all the key elements without being too verbose. Maybe something like: "Network Traffic Data Classification with Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms." This includes the main topic (network traffic data), the method used (PCA), and the application (machine learning algorithms).

I should also consider that some articles might use different terminology, so including synonyms could help, but since it's one string, I can't include too many. Therefore, sticking to the most common terms is better.

After considering all this, the best single search string would be: "Network Traffic Data Classification using Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms."

    title: "An extensible framework for software configuration optimization on
    heterogeneous computing systems: Time and energy case study"
    abstract: Context: Application of component based software engineering methods to heterogeneous computing (HC) enables different software configurations to realize the same function with different non–functional properties (NFP). Finding the best software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs is a non–trivial task. Objective: We propose a Software Component Allocation Framework (SCAF) with the goal to acquire a (sub–) optimal software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs, thus providing performance prediction of a software configuration in its early design phase. We focus on the software configuration optimization for the average energy consumption and average execution time. Method: We validated SCAF through its instantiation on a real–world demonstrator and a simulation. Firstly, we verified the correctness of our model through comparing the performance prediction of six software configurations to the actual performance, obtained through extensive measurements with a confidence interval of 95%. Secondly, to demonstrate how SCAF scales up, we performed software configuration optimization on 55 generated use–cases (with solution spaces ranging from 1030 to 3070) and benchmark the results against best performing random configurations. Results: The performance of a configuration as predicted by our framework matched the configuration implemented and measured on a real–world platform. Furthermore, by applying the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to the weight function given in SCAF, we obtain sub–optimal software configurations differing in performance at most 7% and 13% from the optimal configuration (respectfully). Conclusion: SCAF is capable of correctly describing a HC platform and reliably predict the performance of software configuration in the early design phase. Automated in the form of an Eclipse plugin, SCAF allows software architects to model architectural constraints and preferences, acting as a multi–criterion software architecture decision support system. In addition to said, we also point out several interesting research directions, to further investigate and improve our approach.
    
Answer:<think>
Alright, I need to generate one academic search string based on the provided title and abstract. The article is about a framework called SCAF for optimizing software configurations in heterogeneous computing systems, focusing on time and energy.

First, I'll identify keywords from the title: "extensible framework," "software configuration optimization," "heterogeneous computing systems," and "time and energy." These are core concepts.

Looking at the abstract, key terms include "component-based software engineering," "non-functional properties (NFP)," "performance prediction," "genetic algorithm," and "simulated annealing." Also, mentions of "software architecture decision support system" and "Eclipse plugin" could be relevant.

I should combine these keywords effectively. Using Boolean operators like AND to connect main concepts and OR for synonyms or related terms will help. For example, combining "heterogeneous computing systems" with "component-based software engineering."

I'll structure the search string to include all major aspects: the framework, optimization, performance prediction, algorithms used (genetic algorithm, simulated annealing), and the application in software architecture.

Let me piece it together:

Software Configuration Optimization AND Heterogeneous Computing Systems AND Performance Prediction AND Genetic Algorithm AND Simulated Annealing AND Component-Based Software Engineering

This covers the main topics without being too broad or narrow. It should retrieve relevant articles on optimizing software configurations, especially focusing on time and energy aspects in heterogeneous systems.

Answer:<think>
Okay, so I need to create a search string based on the given title and abstract. Let me start by understanding what the article is about. The title mentions "Input Sample Selection for RBF Neural Network Classification Problems Using Sensitivity Measure." From this, I can tell that the main topics are input sample selection, RBF neural networks, classification problems, and sensitivity measures.

Looking at the abstract, it talks about how large datasets with irrelevant or redundant samples can reduce learning performance and increase costs. They compare various sample selection techniques and propose a novel method using the stochastic radial basis function neural network's sensitivity measure (Sw). The experiments show that 99% of data can be removed while maintaining 92% classification accuracy. They also mention proposing a single, consistent method for both feature and sample selection in supervised RBFNN systems.

So, I need to extract keywords from the title and abstract. Let me list them out:

- Input Sample Selection
- RBF Neural Network
- Classification Problems
- Sensitivity Measure
- Stochastic Radial Basis Function
- Feature Selection
- Active Learning Techniques
- UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Data Set
- Redundant Data Removal

Wait, "UCI IRlS data set" might be a typo. It should probably be "UCI Machine Learning Repository." Also, the abstract mentions "UCI IRlS," which I think is an abbreviation but not sure. Maybe it's better to just include "data set" as a general term unless I can confirm.

Next, I need to group these keywords into clusters based on semantic proximity. Let me see:

Cluster 1: Everything related to RBF Neural Networks and their classification.
- RBF Neural Network
- Classification Problems
- Stochastic Radial Basis Function

Cluster 2: Methods for selecting samples and features.
- Input Sample Selection
- Feature Selection
- Sensitivity Measure
- Redundant Data Removal

Cluster 3: Techniques and experiments related to machine learning data.
- Active Learning Techniques
- UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Data Set
- Experimental Results

Wait, but maybe I should group "Sensitivity Measure" with the sample selection since it's a method used there. So perhaps:

Cluster 1: RBF Neural Network, Classification Problems, Stochastic Radial Basis Function.

Cluster 2: Input Sample Selection, Feature Selection, Sensitivity Measure, Redundant Data Removal.

Cluster 3: Active Learning Techniques, UCI Machine Learning Repository, Experimental Results, Large Datasets.

But I'm not sure if "Large Datasets" is in the abstract. It does mention that large datasets with irrelevant or redundant samples reduce performance, so maybe include that.

Alternatively, perhaps:

Cluster 1: RBF Neural Network, Classification Problems, Stochastic Radial Basis Function.

Cluster 2: Input Sample Selection, Feature Selection, Sensitivity Measure.

Cluster 3: Redundant Data Removal, Large Datasets, Experimental Results, UCI Machine Learning Repository, Active Learning Techniques.

I think that's better because each cluster has terms closely related. Now, I'll connect the terms within each cluster using OR and clusters with AND.

So, Cluster 1: RBF Neural Network OR Classification Problems OR Stochastic Radial Basis Function

Cluster 2: Input Sample Selection OR Feature Selection OR Sensitivity Measure

Cluster 3: Redundant Data Removal OR Large Datasets OR Experimental Results OR UCI Machine Learning Repository OR Active Learning Techniques

Then the search string would be:

(RBF Neural Network OR Classification Problems OR "Stochastic Radial Basis Function") AND (Input Sample Selection OR Feature Selection OR Sensitivity Measure) AND (Redundant Data Removal OR Large Datasets OR Experimental Results OR "UCI Machine Learning Repository" OR Active Learning Techniques)

But wait, I'm not sure if all these terms are necessary. Maybe the core is RBF Neural Network and Classification Problems, along with sensitivity measure and sample selection.

Alternatively, maybe focus on the main aspects: RBFNNs, classification, sensitivity measure, sample selection.

So perhaps clusters could be:

Cluster 1: RBF Neural Network OR "Stochastic Radial Basis Function" (since both are about RBFNN)

Cluster 2: Classification Problems OR Feature Selection

Cluster 3: Sensitivity Measure OR Input Sample Selection

Then the search string would be:

("RBF Neural Network" OR "Stochastic Radial Basis Function") AND (Classification Problems OR Feature Selection) AND (Sensitivity Measure OR Input Sample Selection)

But I'm not sure if that's optimal. The user might want to include terms related to dataset and experiments as well.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to have:

Cluster 1: RBF Neural Network OR "Stochastic Radial Basis Function" OR Classification Problems

Cluster 2: Input Sample Selection OR Feature Selection OR Sensitivity Measure

Then the search string is (RBF Neural Network OR "Stochastic Radial Basis Function" OR Classification Problems) AND (Input Sample Selection OR Feature Selection OR Sensitivity Measure)

This seems more focused on the core topics without including too many peripheral terms.

I think this makes sense because it captures the main focus of the article: RBFNNs in classification and their sample/feature selection using sensitivity measures.
</think>

**Search String:**  
(RBF Neural Network OR "Stochastic Radial Basis Function" OR Classification Problems) AND (Input Sample Selection OR Feature Selection OR Sensitivity Measure)

Answer:<think>
Alright, I need to generate a search string based on the provided title and abstract. Let me start by identifying the most important terms from both.

Looking at the title: "Analysis of Machine Learning Techniques for Context Extraction." The key words here are 'Machine Learning Techniques,' 'Context Extraction.' 

Now the abstract mentions things like user interactions, task categories, automatic detection, classification models, feature types, and feature selection. These seem crucial as they elaborate on how machine learning is applied.

Next step is keyword identification. I'll list all relevant terms: Machine Learning, Context Extraction, User Interactions, Task Categories, Automatic Detection, Classification Models, Feature Types, Feature Selection, Data Set.

Now for clustering. I need to group these into semantically related clusters. 

First cluster could be around the core concepts of Machine Learning Techniques and their application in Context Extraction. That's two terms together.

The next parts might be about how these techniques are applied: so User Interactions, Task Categories, and Feature Selection. These all relate to data collection and processing methods.

Then we have the models and analysis aspects: Classification Models, Feature Types, and Data Set. These tie into the methodology and evaluation of the machine learning approach.

Finally, the outcome or application: Automatic Detection, which is about the system's ability to identify context without manual intervention.

Putting it all together, each cluster will be connected with ORs, and clusters themselves with ANDs. So the search string becomes:

(Machine Learning Techniques OR Context Extraction) AND (User Interactions OR Task Categories OR Feature Selection) AND (Classification Models OR Feature Types OR Data Set) AND (Automatic Detection).

I think this covers all important aspects without being too broad or narrow.

    title: Selecting Discrete and Continuous Features Based on Neighborhood Decision Error Minimization

Answer:<think>
Okay, I'm trying to tackle this user's query where they want me to generate a search string based on an article title and abstract. The instructions are pretty detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them step by step.

First, the title is "Selecting Discrete and Continuous Features Based on Neighborhood Decision Error Minimization." That gives me some keywords right away: discrete features, continuous features, neighborhood decision error minimization. Those seem crucial because they directly relate to what the article is about.

Next, looking at the abstract, it's about feature selection in pattern recognition and machine learning. It mentions NDER (Neighborhood Decision Error Rate) as a new measure for both categorical and numerical features. There’s also something about dividing sample sets into decision regions and using a forward greedy strategy to minimize NDER.

I need to extract keywords from the abstract. The key terms seem to be feature selection, pattern recognition, machine learning, classification complexity, neighborhood decision error rate (NDER), feature evaluation, and forward greedy strategy. Also, the fact that it applies to discrete and continuous features is important, so including those makes sense.

Now, for clustering these keywords. I think they can be grouped into a few main topics. The first cluster would focus on feature selection methods, including things like feature evaluation, classification complexity, and NDER. The second cluster could be about the techniques used, such as the neighborhood rough-set model and the forward greedy strategy. Lastly, since the article handles both discrete and continuous features, that's another cluster.

Putting this together for the search string: I'll use OR within each cluster to connect related terms and AND between clusters. So it would look like "feature selection OR feature evaluation OR classification complexity" combined with "neighborhood decision error rate OR neighborhood rough-set model" and then "discrete features OR continuous features." 

I should make sure not to add any extra info, just the search string as per their request. I also need to list out the extracted keywords and clusters clearly so they can see how I arrived at the final string.
</think>

**Search String:**  
`("feature selection" OR "feature evaluation" OR "classification complexity") AND ("neighborhood decision error rate" OR "neighborhood rough-set model") AND ("discrete features" OR "continuous features")`

**Extracted Keywords and Clusters:**

- **Keywords**: feature selection, feature evaluation, classification complexity, neighborhood decision error rate (NDER), neighborhood rough-set model, discrete features, continuous features, forward greedy strategy

    title: Comprehensive Analysis of Network Traffic Data
    abstract: With the large volume of network traffic flow, it is necessary to preprocess raw data before classification to gain the accurate results speedily. Feature selection is an essential approach in preprocessing phase. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is recognized as an effective and efficient method. In this paper, we classify network traffic by using the PCA technique together with six machine learning algorithms — Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 1-Nearest Neighbor (NN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and H2O. We analyze the impact of PCA through classifying the data set by each algorithm with and without PCA. Experiments are set out by varying the size of input data sets, and the performances are measured from two metrics including overall accuracy and Fmeasure. The computational time is also considered in analysis phase. Our results show that Random Forest and NN are the top two algorithms among the six. Specifically, both of them behave well in classification under the most cases of input sets regardless of applying PCA. Lastly, PCA significantly boosts NN algorithms in terms of classification accuracy and shortens the classification time for Random Forest.

Okay, so I need to help create a search string based on the provided title and abstract. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here. The user has given an article about analyzing network traffic data using PCA with various machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 1-NN, Random Forest, SVM, and H2O. They tested these with and without PCA and looked at accuracy, F-measure, and time.

First, I should extract the most important terms from both the title and abstract. The title is "Comprehensive Analysis of Network Traffic Data," so keywords here include "Network Traffic Data" obviously. In the abstract, the main focus is on preprocessing with feature selection, specifically PCA (Principal Component Analysis) as an effective method. They used six machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 1-Nearest Neighbor (NN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and H2O.

They compared performance metrics like accuracy and F-measure, and also considered computational time. The results showed that Random Forest and NN performed best, especially with PCA improving NN's accuracy and speeding up Random Forest.

So the important terms here are: network traffic data, feature selection, principal component analysis (PCA), machine learning algorithms, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 1-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, H2O, classification accuracy, F-measure, computational time. 

Next, I need to group these keywords into clusters based on semantic proximity. Let's see:

Cluster 1: Core techniques and methods
This would include the main approaches used in the study: feature selection (which is part of preprocessing), PCA (a dimensionality reduction technique), and machine learning algorithms as a whole.

Cluster 2: Specific algorithms
These are the individual ML algorithms they tested: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, 1-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, H2O. I can group them together since they all fall under machine learning models used for classification.

Cluster 3: Performance metrics and outcomes
This would cover how they evaluated the performance—accuracy, F-measure—and other factors like computational time. It's about what was measured during their experiments.

Now, to form the search string, I need to connect terms within each cluster with ORs and clusters with ANDs. So for Cluster 1: "network traffic data" OR "feature selection" OR "principal component analysis (PCA)" OR "machine learning algorithms". 

Cluster 2: "Naive Bayes" OR "Decision Tree" OR "1-Nearest Neighbor" OR "Random Forest" OR "Support Vector Machine" OR "H2O".

Cluster 3: "classification accuracy" OR "F-measure" OR "computational time".

Putting it all together, the search string would be the three clusters connected with ANDs between them.

I think that covers all important aspects. I should make sure not to include any extra terms beyond what's necessary and ensure each cluster is cohesive.

    title: "An extensible framework for software configuration optimization on
    heterogeneous computing systems: Time and energy case study"
    abstract: Context: Application of component based software engineering methods to heterogeneous computing (HC) enables different software configurations to realize the same function with different non–functional properties (NFP). Finding the best software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs is a non–trivial task. Objective: We propose a Software Component Allocation Framework (SCAF) with the goal to acquire a (sub–) optimal software configuration with respect to multiple NFPs, thus providing performance prediction of a software configuration in its early design phase. We focus on the software configuration optimization for the average energy consumption and average execution time. Method: We validated SCAF through its instantiation on a real–world demonstrator and a simulation. Firstly, we verified the correctness of our model through comparing the performance prediction of six software configurations to the actual performance, obtained through extensive measurements with a confidence interval of 95%. Secondly, to demonstrate how SCAF scales up, we performed software configuration optimization on 55 generated use–cases (with solution spaces ranging from 1030 to 3070) and benchmark the results against best performing random configurations. Results: The performance of a configuration as predicted by our framework matched the configuration implemented and measured on a real–world platform. Furthermore, by applying the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing to the weight function given in SCAF, we obtain sub–optimal software configurations differing in performance at most 7% and 13% from the optimal configuration (respectfully). Conclusion: SCAF is capable of correctly describing a HC platform and reliably predict the performance of software configuration in the early design phase. Automated in the form of an Eclipse plugin, SCAF allows software architects to model architectural constraints and preferences, acting as a multi–criterion software architecture decision support system. In addition to said, we also point out several interesting research directions, to further investigate and improve our approach.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to create a search string based on the given title and abstract of a scientific article. The user has provided a detailed example, but now it's my turn to think through the process step by step.

First, I'll start by reading the title and abstract carefully to understand the main topic of the paper. The title mentions an "extensible framework for software configuration optimization on heterogeneous computing systems," specifically looking at time and energy. So, keywords related to software configuration optimization, frameworks, and heterogeneous computing seem important.

Looking at the abstract, it talks about component-based software engineering in HC enabling different configurations with varying non-functional properties (NFPs). The goal is to find the best configuration regarding multiple NFPs like energy consumption and execution time. They developed a framework called SCAF, which predicts performance early in the design phase. They validated this through a demonstrator and simulation, using methods like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.

So, breaking down the main concepts: software configuration optimization, heterogeneous computing systems, non-functional properties (especially time and energy), frameworks, and maybe terms related to performance prediction and genetic algorithms/simulated annealing for optimization.

Next, I need to identify keywords. These should be specific terms that are central to the topic. From the title, "extensible framework," "software configuration optimization," "heterogeneous computing systems," "time and energy." From the abstract, adding terms like "non-functional properties," "performance prediction," "genetic algorithm," "simulated annealing," "Eclipse plugin," and maybe "component-based software engineering."

Now, I'll group these keywords into clusters based on semantic proximity. Clusters should represent specific topics.

- Cluster 1: Software Configuration Optimization, Heterogeneous Computing Systems
- Cluster 2: Non-functional Properties (NFPs), Energy Consumption, Execution Time
- Cluster 3: Framework Development, Performance Prediction, Early Design Phase
- Cluster 4: Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Optimization Techniques
- Cluster 5: Component-Based Software Engineering, Eclipse Plugin

Wait, maybe some of these can be combined. For example, "component-based software engineering" and "framework development" could be one cluster since they relate to the architecture and tooling aspect.

Alternatively, perhaps:

Cluster 1: Software Configuration Optimization, Heterogeneous Computing
Cluster 2: Non-functional Properties (NFPs), Energy Consumption, Execution Time
Cluster 3: Framework Development, Performance Prediction, Early Design Phase
Cluster 4: Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Optimization Techniques

This way, each cluster covers a distinct area but related to the overall topic.

Now, I need to create the search string. Within each cluster, I'll connect terms with OR, and between clusters with AND. So:

(Cluster1 keywords connected by OR) AND (Cluster2 keywords connected by OR) AND ... etc.

Putting it all together, the search string would look something like this:

"Software Configuration Optimization OR Heterogeneous Computing" AND "Non-functional Properties OR Energy Consumption OR Execution Time" AND "Framework Development OR Performance Prediction OR Early Design Phase" AND "Genetic Algorithm OR Simulated Annealing OR Optimization Techniques"

But I should make sure to include all the important keywords without making it too broad. Maybe I can refine the clusters a bit more.

Looking back, perhaps the term "component-based software engineering" is also crucial, so maybe include that in another cluster or combine it with framework development.

Alternatively, adjust the clusters as:

Cluster 1: Software Configuration Optimization, Heterogeneous Computing
Cluster 2: Energy Consumption, Execution Time
Cluster 3: Framework Development, Performance Prediction
Cluster 4: Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing

And also include "component-based software engineering" in Cluster 5.

So the search string would be:

(Software Configuration Optimization OR Heterogeneous Computing) AND (Energy Consumption OR Execution Time) AND (Framework Development OR Performance Prediction) AND (Genetic Algorithm OR Simulated Annealing)

But maybe including more specific terms from the abstract like "component-based software engineering" and "Eclipse plugin" could help, but they might be too specific. It's a balance between specificity and relevance.

I think the main clusters should focus on the core aspects: optimization in heterogeneous systems, NFPs (time and energy), framework development, and optimization techniques. So, I'll proceed with those four clusters as above.
</think>

**Search String:**

("Software Configuration Optimization" OR "Heterogeneous Computing") AND ("Energy Consumption" OR "Execution Time") AND ("Framework Development" OR "Performance Prediction") AND ("Genetic Algorithm" OR "Simulated Annealing")

**Extracted Keywords:**
- Software Configuration Optimization
- Heterogeneous Computing
- Energy Consumption
- Execution Time
- Framework Development
- Performance Prediction
- Genetic Algorithm
- Simulated Annealing

**Clusters Formed:**
1. **Software Configuration Optimization, Heterogeneous Computing**
2. **Energy Consumption, Execution Time**
3. **Framework Development, Performance Prediction**
4. **Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing**

This search string effectively captures the core aspects of the paper by grouping related terms and ensuring a focused retrieval of relevant articles.
