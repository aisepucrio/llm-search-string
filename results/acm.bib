abstract = {Self-supervised learning has recently shown great potential in graph representation learning. However, there are still challenges in using pre-trained models for downstream tasks such as molecule properties prediction. To address this, we propose node-level and graph-level self-supervised strategies for pre-training graph neural networks(GNNs) to capture molecular graphs’ local and global structural patterns. We propose a node-level method called local contrastive learning, which aims to embed nodes that appear in similar local structures across different graphs in close proximity to each other. At the graph level, we propose a predictive learning method to predict the occurrence of functional groups in a molecule. Our empirical results show that our proposed strategies achieves competitive or better performance compared to state-of-the-art strategies.},

abstract = {In the two-past decade, by using the methods of machine learning, the accuracy of performing computer-aided tasks successfully improved. Search engines (Google, Baidu, Bing...) use classification methods to rank the billion pages available on the world wide web. Rankings are made according to the algorithms with various features, which classify each page for a search engine request. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the performance of various machine learning models applied on features selected through different techniques. A dataset, composed of 31 features with 28,000 observations, has been evaluated considering only the characteristics with the highest correlation. To achieve that goal three filter methods were used (Chi-square, Gini index and Fisher) and three wrapper methods (Forward Selection, Backward Elimination and Bidirectional Elimination). To continue the research various classification algorithms were tested to create combination models with previous filtered and wrapper methods. Then, a comparison was done to determine the optimal features' combinations, to improve the correct prediction for an URL to be on Google Top10 SERP. From the research, it can be concluded that for this dataset, the Random Forest model combined with the Fisher filter method or Backward Elimination wrapper method could produce the best results among others.},

abstract = {Deep learning-based recommender systems have achieved remarkable success in recent years. However, these methods usually heavily rely on labeled data (i.e., user-item interactions), suffering from problems such as data sparsity and cold-start. Self-supervised learning, an emerging paradigm that extracts information from unlabeled data, provides insights into addressing these problems. Specifically, contrastive self-supervised learning, due to its flexibility and promising performance, has attracted considerable interest and recently become a dominant branch in self-supervised learning-based recommendation methods. In this survey, we provide an up-to-date and comprehensive review of current contrastive self-supervised learning-based recommendation methods. Firstly, we propose a unified framework for these methods. We then introduce a taxonomy based on the key components of the framework, including view generation strategy, contrastive task, and contrastive objective. For each component, we provide detailed descriptions and discussions to guide the choice of the appropriate method. Finally, we outline open issues and promising directions for future research.},

abstract = {Machine learning models are only as good as their training data. Simple models trained on well-chosen features extracted from the raw data often outperform complex models trained directly on the raw data. Data preparation pipelines, which clean and derive features from the data, are therefore important for machine learning applications. However, constructing such pipelines is a resource-intensive process that involves deep human expertise.Our goal is to design an efficient framework for automatically finding high-quality data preparation pipelines. The main challenge is how to explore a large search space of pipeline components with the objective of computing features that maximize the performance of the downstream models. Existing solutions are limited in terms of feature quality, which results in low accuracies of the downstream models, while incurring significant runtime overhead. We present CtxPipe, a novel framework that addresses the limitations of previous works by leveraging contextual information to improve the pipeline construction process. Specifically, it uses pre-trained embedding models to capture the data semantics, which are then used to guide the selection of pipeline components. We implement CtxPipe with deep reinforcement learning and evaluate it against state-of-the-art automated pipeline construction solutions. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CtxPipe outperforms all of the baselines in both model performance and runtime cost.},

This involves managing daily incoming tasks based on their level of urgency and importance.To allow all workers to utilize the urgency-importance matrix as a time-management tool, we need to automate this tool. The textual content of incoming tasks are analyzed, and metrics related to urgency and importance are extracted. A third factor (i.e., the response variable) is defined based on the two input variables (urgency and importance). Then, machine learning applied to the data to predict the class of incoming tasks based on data outcome desired. We used ordinal regression, neural networks, and decision tree algorithms to predict the four levels of task priority. We measure the performance of all using recalls, precisions, and F-scores. All classifiers perform higher than 89% in terms of all measures.},

The T1-weighted, diffusion-weighted and susceptibility-weighted images from healthy controls (n=67), PD patients (n=75) and PPS patients (n=29) were collected. For HC versus PD, the optimal performance was achieved by the integration of QSM with T1 or DTI with an accuracy of 86%, recall of 80%, precision of 100% and f1 score of 89%. For HC versus PS, DTI performed best with an accuracy of 73%, recall of 100%, precision of 57% and f1 score of 73%. For PD versus PS, the combinations involving QSM exhibited the optimal performance with an accuracy of 83%, recall of 100%, precision of 50% and f1 score of 67%.

abstract = {This paper explores human activities recognition from sensor-based multi-dimensional streams. Recently, deep learning-based methods such as LSTM and CNN have achieved important progress in practical application scenarios. However, in most previous deep learning-based methods exist potential challenges such as class imbalance and multi-modal heterogeneity with time and sensor signals. To handle those problems, we propose a graph LSTM and Metric Learning model (GLML) with multiple construction graph fusion by modeling the sensor-aspect signals and the graph-aspect activities. GLML is a semi-supervised co-training architecture, which can be seen as several iteratively pseudo-labels sampling processing in the unlabeled data. Specifically, we construct three graphs to capture the different relations in each timestamp. Meanwhile, the graph attention model and attention mechanism are proposed to integrate multiple graph interactions for different sensor signals. Furthermore, to obtain a fixed representation of hidden state units and their neighboring nodes, we introduce the Graph LSTM to learn the graph-aspect relations from graph-structured constructed graphs. Notably, we propose a multi-task classification model combining loss function for classification distribution with deep metric learning to enhance the representation ability of the multi-modal sensor data. Experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our proposed GLML model has at least 2.44% improved in average against the state-of-the-art methods.},

However, these become distorted and misleading when explaining predictions of images that are subject to systematic error (bias) by perturbations and corruptions. Furthermore, the distortions persist despite model fine-tuning on images biased by different factors (blur, color temperature, day/night). We present Debiased-CAM to recover explanation faithfulness across various bias types and levels by training a multi-input, multi-task model with auxiliary tasks for explanation and bias level predictions. In simulation studies, the approach not only enhanced prediction accuracy, but also generated highly faithful explanations about these predictions as if the images were unbiased. In user studies, debiased explanations improved user task performance, perceived truthfulness and perceived helpfulness. Debiased training can provide a versatile platform for robust performance and explanation faithfulness for a wide range of applications with data biases.},

abstract = {The multitude of data generated by sensors available on users' mobile devices, combined with advances in machine learning techniques, support context-aware services in recognizing the current situation of a user (i.e., physical context) and optimizing the system's personalization features. However, context-awareness performances mainly depend on the accuracy of the context inference process, which is strictly tied to the availability of large-scale and labeled datasets. In this work, we present a framework developed to collect datasets containing heterogeneous sensing data derived from personal mobile devices. The framework has been used by 3 voluntary users for two weeks, generating a dataset with more than 36K samples and 1331 features. We also propose a lightweight approach to model the user context able to efficiently perform the entire reasoning process on the user mobile device. To this aim, we used six dimensionality reduction techniques in order to optimize the context classification. Experimental results on the generated dataset show that we achieve a 10x speed up and a feature reduction of more than 90% while keeping the accuracy loss less than 3%.},

abstract = {Deep learning methods are successfully used in applications pertaining to ubiquitous computing, pervasive intelligence, health, and well-being. Specifically, the area of human activity recognition (HAR) is primarily transformed by the convolutional and recurrent neural networks, thanks to their ability to learn semantic representations directly from raw input. However, in order to extract generalizable features massive amounts of well-curated data are required, which is a notoriously challenging task; hindered by privacy issues and annotation costs. Therefore, unsupervised representation learning (i.e., learning without manually labeling the instances) is of prime importance to leverage the vast amount of unlabeled data produced by smart devices. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised technique for feature learning from sensory data that does not require access to any form of semantic labels, i.e., activity classes. We learn a multi-task temporal convolutional network to recognize transformations applied on an input signal. By exploiting these transformations, we demonstrate that simple auxiliary tasks of the binary classification result in a strong supervisory signal for extracting useful features for the down-stream task. We extensively evaluate the proposed approach on several publicly available datasets for smartphone-based HAR in unsupervised, semi-supervised and transfer learning settings. Our method achieves performance levels superior to or comparable with fully-supervised networks trained directly with activity labels, and it performs significantly better than unsupervised learning through autoencoders. Notably, for the semi-supervised case, the self-supervised features substantially boost the detection rate by attaining a kappa score between 0.7 - 0.8 with only 10 labeled examples per class. We get similar impressive performance even if the features are transferred from a different data source. Self-supervision drastically reduces the requirement of labeled activity data, effectively narrowing the gap between supervised and unsupervised techniques for learning meaningful representations. While this paper focuses on HAR as the application domain, the proposed approach is general and could be applied to a wide variety of problems in other areas.},

abstract = {With access to large datasets, deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved human-level accuracy in image and speech recognition tasks. However, in chemistry data is inherently small and fragmented. In this work, we develop an approach of using rule-based knowledge for training ChemNet, a transferable and generalizable deep neural network for chemical property prediction that learns in a weak-supervised manner from large unlabeled chemical databases. When coupled with transfer learning approaches to predict other smaller datasets for chemical properties that it was not originally trained on, we show that ChemNet's accuracy outperforms contemporary DNN models that were trained using conventional supervised learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ChemNet pre-training approach is equally effective on both CNN (Chemception) and RNN (SMILES2vec) models, indicating that this approach is network architecture agnostic and is effective across multiple data modalities. Our results indicate a pre-trained ChemNet that incorporates chemistry domain knowledge and enables the development of generalizable neural networks for more accurate prediction of novel chemical properties.},

abstract = {Recommender system is one of the most popular data mining topics that keep drawing extensive attention from both academia and industry. Among them, POI (point of interest) recommendation is extremely practical but challenging: it greatly benefits both users and businesses in real-world life, but it is hard due to data scarcity and various context. While a number of algorithms attempt to tackle the problem w.r.t. specific data and problem settings, they often fail when the scenarios change. In this work, we propose to devise a general and principled SSL (semi-supervised learning) framework, to alleviate data scarcity via smoothing among neighboring users and POIs, and treat various context by regularizing user preference based on context graphs. To enable such a framework, we develop PACE (Preference And Context Embedding), a deep neural architecture that jointly learns the embeddings of users and POIs to predict both user preference over POIs and various context associated with users and POIs. We show that PACE successfully bridges CF (collaborative filtering) and SSL by generalizing the de facto methods matrix factorization of CF and graph Laplacian regularization of SSL. Extensive experiments on two real location-based social network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PACE.},

Real-time user activity fingerprinting, an effective method within continuous authentication, examines behaviors like keystroke patterns, mouse movements, and browsing habits to craft a distinctive user profile or "fingerprint." This approach boasts advantages over traditional authentication methods such as passwords or tokens, enhancing security by complicating imitation of user behavior while also streamlining the login process.

abstract = {Cyberbullying has emerged as a large-scale societal problem that demands accurate methods for its detection in an effort to mitigate its detrimental consequences. While automated, data-driven techniques for analyzing and detecting cyberbullying incidents have been developed, the scalability of existing approaches has largely been ignored. At the same time, the complexities underlying cyberbullying behavior (e.g., social context and changing language) make the automatic identification of "the best subset of features" to use challenging. We address this gap by formulating cyberbullying detection as a sequential hypothesis testing problem. Based on this formulation, we propose a novel algorithm to drastically reduce the number of features used in classification. We demonstrate the utility, scalability and responsiveness of our approach using a real-world dataset from Instagram, the online social media platform with the highest percentage of users reporting experiencing cyberbullying. Our approach improves recall by a staggering 700%, while at the same time reducing the average number of features by up to 99.82% compared to state-of-the-art supervised cyberbullying detection methods, learning approaches that require weak supervision, and traditional offline feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques.},

abstract = {The ever-growing computation and storage capability of mobile phones have given rise to mobile-centric context recognition systems, which are able to sense and analyze the context of the carrier so as to provide an appropriate level of service. As nonintrusive autonomous sensing and context recognition are desirable characteristics of a personal sensing system; efforts have been made to develop opportunistic sensing techniques on mobile phones. The resulting combination of these approaches has ushered in a new realm of applications, namely opportunistic user context recognition with mobile phones.This article surveys the existing research and approaches towards realization of such systems. In doing so, the typical architecture of a mobile-centric user context recognition system as a sequential process of sensing, preprocessing, and context recognition phases is introduced. The main techniques used for the realization of the respective processes during these phases are described, and their strengths and limitations are highlighted. In addition, lessons learned from previous approaches are presented as motivation for future research. Finally, several open challenges are discussed as possible ways to extend the capabilities of current systems and improve their real-world experience.},

To accomplish this on smartphones, we propose a system that analyzes the user's text typing behavior using a semi-supervised deep learning pipeline for predicting affective states measured by valence, arousal, and dominance. Using a data collection study with 70 participants on text conversations designed to trigger different affective responses, we developed a variational auto-encoder to learn efficient feature embeddings of two-dimensional heat maps generated from touch data while participants engaged in these conversations. Using the learned embedding in a cross-validated analysis, our system predicted three levels (low, medium, high) of valence (AUC up to 0.84), arousal (AUC up to 0.82), and dominance (AUC up to 0.82). These results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to accurately predict affective states based only on touch data.},

The energy expenses of the platform determine the reliability of green IoT based services and applications. This manuscript introduces a decisive energy management scheme for optimal resource allocation and offloading along with energy constraints. This scheme handles both the allocation and energy-cost in a balanced manner through deterministic task offloading. In particular, resource allocation solution for non-delay tolerant green IoT applications is focused by confining the failures of discrete tasks through neural learning. The dropout process augmented with the learning process improves the feasible conditions for resource handling and task offloading among the active IoT service providers. Through extensive simulations the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed and energy consumption, failure rate, processing, and completion time metrics are used for a comparative study. Further, the optimal utilization and on-demand dissipation of such stored resources help to improve the sustainability of green power and communication technologies in the smart city environment.},

abstract = {Counterfactual frameworks have grown popular in machine learning for both explaining algorithmic decisions but also defining individual notions of fairness, more intuitive than typical group fairness conditions. However, state-of-the-art models to compute counterfactuals are either unrealistic or unfeasible. In particular, while Pearl's causal inference provides appealing rules to calculate counterfactuals, it relies on a model that is unknown and hard to discover in practice. We address the problem of designing realistic and feasible counterfactuals in the absence of a causal model. We define transport-based counterfactual models as collections of joint probability distributions between observable distributions, and show their connection to causal counterfactuals. More specifically, we argue that optimal-transport theory defines relevant transport-based counterfactual models, as they are numerically feasible, statistically-faithful, and can coincide under some assumptions with causal counterfactual models. Finally, these models make counterfactual approaches to fairness feasible, and we illustrate their practicality and efficiency on fair learning. With this paper, we aim at laying out the theoretical foundations for a new, implementable approach to counterfactual thinking.},

We tested the counterfactual generation process using four algorithms (DiCE, WatcherCF, prototype, and GrowingSpheresCF) in the literature in 25 different datasets.

Algorithms that do not consider plausibility in their internal mechanisms will lead to biased and unreliable conclusions if evaluated with the current state-of-the-art metrics; (4) A counterfactual inspection analysis is strongly recommended to ensure a robust examination of counterfactual explanations and the potential identification of biases.},

abstract = {The Brain Computer Interface provides a channel of communication to physically challenged individuals who have fully or partially lost the power to interact with their surroundings. The strength of a BCI system lies in its ability to determine the appropriate features for a given task and to be able to correctly classify a task amid many other mental tasks. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a cost effect and efficient means to capture the intent of a person with motor disorder. Wavelet decomposition for feature extraction from EEG is suitable for the analysis of non-linear and non-stationary time series. Hence, Wavelet decomposition of EEG is used in this study to form a feature set. Of the extracted features, a subset of discriminatory and relevant features is selected using ratio of scatter matrices, Chernoff distance measure and linear regression. The performance of different mental tasks using the selected features is compared and evaluated in terms of classification accuracy and the dimension of features. Experimental results on publicly available data show that there is significant improvement in classification accuracies with different feature selection methods. Linear regression performs better in comparison to other two methods and Support Vector Machine requires lesser number of features to build the model.},

abstract = {The application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) across a wide range of domains comes with both high expectations of its benefits and dire predictions of misuse. While AI systems have largely been driven by a technology-centered design approach, the potential societal consequences of AI have mobilized both HCI and AI researchers towards researching human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI). However, there remains considerable ambiguity about what it means to frame, design and evaluate HCAI. This paper presents a critical review of the large corpus of peer-reviewed literature emerging on HCAI in order to characterize what the community is defining as HCAI. Our review contributes an overview and map of HCAI research based on work that explicitly mentions the terms ‘human-centered artificial intelligence’ or ‘human-centered machine learning’ or their variations, and suggests future challenges and research directions. The map reveals the breadth of research happening in HCAI, established clusters and the emerging areas of Interaction with AI and Ethical AI. The paper contributes a new definition of HCAI, and calls for greater collaboration between AI and HCI research, and new HCAI constructs.},

abstract = {The ability to draw logical conclusions in ontologies from explicitly given axioms and facts is one of the key advantages of using semantic technologies. Based on the W3C recommendation of the Web Ontology Language (OWL) a variety of reasoners have been developed for this task. Different language profiles, reasoning algorithms, and special-purpose optimisation techniques have brought up reasoners with various strengths and weaknesses. Selecting the most suitable reasoner for a given reasoning scenario thus is a challenge. This paper presents an automatic reasoner selection approach based on machine learning techniques. The most important ontology and query features are identified and used for learning a model that can be used to predict the best performing reasoner for a given request. The approach is implemented as a strategy in a reasoning broker framework called HERAKLES. Using a training set consisting of 187 real-world ontologies found on the Internet, we evaluated four different machine learning techniques. The results show that a machine learning based reasoner selection strategy can predict the best performing reasoner for a given reasoning request with more than 77% accuracy.},

abstract = {Behavior decision-making in the dialogue domain is the key to the success of the dialogue system. Existing machine learning algorithm based on statistics and an deep learning algorithm based on pre-training are difficult to adapt to all tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-task classification model based on soft gating. Firstly, based on the existing models, a multi-task model suitable for specific fields is designed, which makes the model fully consider the characteristics of the data set itself. Secondly, soft gating is used to divide the model to reduce the interaction between model parameters. Then, we manually annotate and extend the existing session behavior data set. Finally, the trained model is used to recognize dialogue behavior. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the score is 89.1%. The experimental results show that the performance of SGSAM better than other models.},

abstract = {The environmental context of a mobile device determines how it is used and how the device can optimize operations for greater efficiency and usability. We consider the problem of detecting if a device is indoor or outdoor. Towards this end, we present a general method employing semi-supervised machine learning and using only the lightweight sensors on a smartphone. We find that a particular semi-supervised learning method called co-training, when suitably engineered, is most effective. It is able to automatically learn characteristics of new environments and devices, and thereby provides a detection accuracy exceeding 90% even in unfamiliar circumstances. It can learn and adapt online, in real time, at modest computational costs. Thus the method is suitable for on-device learning. Implementation of the indoor-outdoor detection service based on our method is lightweight in energy use -- it can sleep when not in use and does not need to track the device state continuously. It is shown to outperform existing indoor-outdoor detection techniques that rely on static algorithms or GPS, in terms of both accuracy and energy-efficiency.},

abstract = {It is widely agreed that information retrieval (IR) systems benefit enormously from considering not only the user's query but also contextual data. In enterprise IR systems corporate knowledge bases and additional manually triggered information about users are normally taken to obtain such contextual data.In this paper we propose a solution for role-specific search in enterprise environments without the need of manual administration of mappings between roles and documents. We include collaboratively constructed knowledge engineering systems for computing similarity measures between user role attributes and relevant information snippets in enterprise documents.Our approach suggestsoptimizing such enterprise search systems by a role-sensitive ranking algorithm that relates contextually-derived information needs of users to unstructured (textual) data in documents. Hence we introduce a linguistic conceptfor generatingrole describing word vectorsbased on query (search) histories and corporate knowledge base generation.The Introduction outlines some basic ideas concerning the major areas of enterprise search, some relevant differences between web search and enterprise search. Subsequently we sketch our optimized enterprise search model.In Chapter 2some theoretical background and Related Work is briefly discussed.Chapter 3depicts some linguistically relevant details of our proposed model. We discuss our concept of User Roles, Role Term Vectors, some approaches for Role Term Extraction andTerm Extraction incorporating knowledge bases and query histories. In Chapter4 we describe our ranking mechanism, the re-ranking strategy and the method for Role Relevance Scoring. Chapter 5 gives a conclusion of the work as well as an outlook on future work.},

abstract = {RSSI-based indoor localization is getting much attention. Thanks to a number of researchers, the localization accuracy has already reached a sufficient level. However, it is still not easy-to-use technology because of its heavy installation cost. When an indoor localization system is installed, it needs to collect RSSI data for training classifiers. Existing techniques need to collect enough data at each location. This is why the installation cost is very heavy. We propose a technique to gather data efficiently by using machine learning techniques. Our proposed algorithm is based on multi-task learning and Bayesian optimization. This algorithm can remove the need to collect data of all location labels and select location labels to acquire new data efficiently. We verify this algorithm by using a Wi-Fi RSSI dataset collected in a building. The empirical results suggest that the algorithm is superior to an existing algorithm applying single-task learning and Active Class Selection.},

abstract = {Meta learning has attracted much attention recently in machine learning community. Contrary to conventional machine learning aiming to learn inherent prediction rules to predict labels for new query data, meta learning aims to learn the learning methodology for machine learning from observed tasks, so as to generalize to new query tasks by leveraging the meta-learned learning methodology. In this study, we achieve such learning methodology by learning an explicit hyper-parameter prediction function shared by all training tasks, and we call this learning process as Simulating Learning Methodology (SLeM). Specifically, this function is represented as a parameterized function called meta-learner, mapping from a training/test task to its suitable hyper-parameter setting, extracted from a prespecified function set called meta learning machine. Such setting guarantees that the meta-learned learning methodology is able to flexibly fit diverse query tasks, instead of only obtaining fixed hyper-parameters by many current meta learning methods, with less adaptability to query task's variations. Such understanding of meta learning also makes it easily succeed from traditional learning theory for analyzing its generalization bounds with general losses/tasks/models. The theory naturally leads to some feasible controlling strategies for ameliorating the quality of the extracted meta-learner, verified to be able to finely ameliorate its generalization capability in some typical meta learning applications, including few-shot regression, few-shot classification and domain generalization.

abstract = {In automated sleep monitoring systems, bed occupancy detection is the foundation or the first step before other downstream tasks, such as inferring sleep activities and vital signs. The existing methods do not generalize well to real-world environments due to single environment settings and rely on threshold-based approaches. Manually selecting thresholds requires observing a large amount of data and may not yield optimal results. In contrast, acquiring extensive labeled sensory data poses significant challenges regarding cost and time. Hence, developing models capable of generalizing across diverse environments with limited data is imperative. This paper introduces SeismoDot, which consists of a self-supervised learning module and a spectral-temporal feature fusion module for bed occupancy detection. Unlike conventional methods that require separate pre-training and fine-tuning, our self-supervised learning module is co-optimized with the primary target task, which directs learned representations toward a task-relevant embedding space while expanding the feature space. The proposed feature fusion module enables the simultaneous exploitation of temporal and spectral features, enhancing the diversity of information from both domains. By combining these techniques, SeismoDot expands the diversity of embedding space for both the temporal and spectral domains to enhance its generalizability across different environments. SeismoDot not only achieves high accuracy (98.49%) and F1 scores (98.08%) across 13 diverse environments, but it also maintains high performance (97.01% accuracy and 96.54% F1 score) even when trained with just 20% (4 days) of the total data. This demonstrates its exceptional ability to generalize across various environmental settings, even with limited data availability.},

Several parameters can diagnose a patient who is positive for coronary artery disease (CAD). These parameters based on demographic, symptom and examination, ECG, and laboratory and echo features. For prevention needs to be done by early detection of patients who have the potential to have CAD. One way to do early detection is by building a system for making predictions. In this study, researchers used the KNN method by developing the weight of each class to increase accuracy. Before entering the KNN, the data will perform feature selection using SVM-RFE to find the ideal features and speed up computing time. The results of the KNN without feature selection are 82.65% of accuracy, the KNN with feature selection achieves 86.33% of accuracy, the Weighted KNN without feature selection achieves 83.45% of accuracy, and the Weighted KNN with feature selection achieves 90.88% of accuracy. The results prove the effectiveness of the Weighted KNN with feature selection.},

We consider as symbolic any language being intelligible and interpretable for both humans and computers. Accordingly, we propose general meta-models for both SKE and SKI, along with two taxonomies for the classification of SKE and SKI methods. By adopting an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) perspective, we highlight how such methods can be exploited to mitigate the aforementioned opacity issue. Our taxonomies are attained by surveying and classifying existing methods from the literature, following a systematic approach, and by generalising the results of previous surveys targeting specific sub-topics of either SKE or SKI alone. More precisely, we analyse 132 methods for SKE and 117 methods for SKI, and we categorise them according to their purpose, operation, expected input/output data and predictor types. For each method, we also indicate the presence/lack of runnable software implementations. Our work may be of interest for data scientists aiming at selecting the most adequate SKE/SKI method for their needs, and may also work as suggestions for researchers interested in filling the gaps of the current state-of-the-art as well as for developers willing to implement SKE/SKI-based technologies.},

abstract = {Many facts change over time, which is a fundamental aspect of our physical environment. In the case of pandemic articles, the user is not interested in the creation date of the document but in the facts and the cause of the last pandemic. Fake news can be better combated by having a document with a temporal focus. Currently, neither the sequence of events nor the temporal focus is considered when obtaining news documents. Despite the limited number of temporal aspects in the available datasets, it is difficult to test and evaluate the temporal conclusions of the model. The goal of this work is to develop a temporal focus news article retrieval model based on co-training to advance research in semi-supervised learning. A mapping of the dataset is performed using (1) the evolving focus time of news articles and (2) the semi-supervised method based on coincidence contexts for learning low-dimensional continuous vectors for learning neural contrast embedding models generating focus time-based query in sequential news articles to facilitate temporal understanding by learning low-dimensional continuous vectors. A diverse dataset of news articles is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. With semi-supervised learning and lexicon expansion, the result of the developed model can achieve 89%. The method performed better than previous baselines and traditional machine learning models with improvements of 12.65% and 4.7%, respectively.},

abstract = {Developing artificial learning systems that can understand and generate natural language has been one of the long-standing goals of artificial intelligence. Recent decades have witnessed an impressive progress on both of these problems, giving rise to a new family of approaches. Especially, the advances in deep learning over the past couple of years have led to neural approaches to natural language generation (NLG). These methods combine generative language learning techniques with neural-networks based frameworks. With a wide range of applications in natural language processing, neural NLG (NNLG) is a new and fast growing field of research. In this state-of-the-art report, we investigate the recent developments and applications of NNLG in its full extent from a multidimensional view, covering critical perspectives such as multimodality, multilinguality, controllability and learning strategies. We summarize the fundamental building blocks of NNLG approaches from these aspects and provide detailed reviews of commonly used preprocessing steps and basic neural architectures. This report also focuses on the seminal applications of these NNLG models such as machine translation, description generation, automatic speech recognition, abstractive summarization, text simplification, question answering and generation, and dialogue generation. Finally, we conclude with a thorough discussion of the described frameworks by pointing out some open research directions.},

However, this step gets relatively little attention in the literature as focus is mostly placed on model configuration. As standard model architectures have become more accessible to the wider eye-tracking community, we highlight the importance of carefully choosing feature representations within scanpath images as they may heavily affect classification accuracy. To illustrate this point, we create thirteen sets of scanpath designs incorporating different eye-tracking feature representations from data recorded during a task-based viewing experiment. We evaluate each scanpath design by passing the sets of images through a standard pre-trained deep learning model as well as a SVM image classifier. Results from our primary experiment show an average accuracy improvement of 25 percentage points between the best-performing set and one baseline set.},

In the second study, conducted in more ecologically valid setting for HCI research, we attained a mean classification accuracy of 92.4% using three tasks that included non-cognitive features: a relaxation task, playing a PC based game without opponents, and engaging opponents within the game.

abstract = {In the current era, people and society have grown increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. AI has the potential to drive us towards a future in which all of humanity flourishes. It also comes with substantial risks for oppression and calamity. Discussions about whether we should (re)trust AI have repeatedly emerged in recent years and in many quarters, including industry, academia, healthcare, services, and so on. Technologists and AI researchers have a responsibility to develop trustworthy AI systems. They have responded with great effort to design more responsible AI algorithms. However, existing technical solutions are narrow in scope and have been primarily directed towards algorithms for scoring or classification tasks, with an emphasis on fairness and unwanted bias. To build long-lasting trust between AI and human beings, we argue that the key is to think beyond algorithmic fairness and connect major aspects of AI that potentially cause AI’s indifferent behavior. In this survey, we provide a systematic framework of Socially Responsible AI Algorithms that aims to examine the subjects of AI indifference and the need for socially responsible AI algorithms, define the objectives, and introduce the means by which we may achieve these objectives. We further discuss how to leverage this framework to improve societal well-being through protection, information, and prevention/mitigation.

Based on the emerging attention mechanism capturing models’ focus points of input data, we proposed in this paper the attention neural network for digital context classification from Internet traffic: firstly, we introduced a digital context model and an extended version of multi-label dataset of Internet traffic to support our classification work. In the following, single task models and a multi-task model were proposed, and a series of experiments on five classification tasks of digital context has been conducted to evaluate the performance of recurrent models, attention models and the multi-task model. Experiments’ results have shown that different attention mechanisms are able to improve the outcome of recurrent classification models for Internet traffic, while multi-task attention network is able to further improve the overall accuracy of all tasks in the model by mutualizing data and exploiting implicit relations among tasks.},

abstract = {Named entity recognition studies the problem of locating and classifying parts of free text into a set of predefined categories. Although extensive research has focused on the detection of person, location and organization entities, there are many other entities of interest, including phone numbers, dates, times and currencies (to name a few examples). We refer to these types of entities as "semi-structured named entities", since they usually follow certain syntactic formats according to some conventions, although their structure is typically not well-defined. Regular expression solutions require significant amount of manual effort and supervised machine learning approaches rely on large sets of labeled training data. Therefore, these approaches do not scale when we need to support many semi-structured entity types in many languages and regions.In this paper, we study this problem and propose a novel three-level bootstrapping framework for the detection of semi-structured entities. We describe the proposed techniques for phone, date and time entities, and perform extensive evaluations on English, German, Polish, Swedish and Turkish documents. Despite the minimal input from the user, our approach can achieve 95% precision and 84% recall for phone entities, and 94% precision and 81% recall for date and time entities, on average. We also discuss implementation details and report run time performance results, which show significant improvements over regular expression based solutions.},

abstract = {Distributional similarity has been widely used to capture the semantic relatedness of words in many NLP tasks. However, various parameters such as similarity measures must be hand-tuned to make it work effectively. Instead, we propose a novel approach to synonym identification based on supervised learning and distributional features, which correspond to the commonality of individual context types shared by word pairs. Considering the integration with pattern-based features, we have built and compared five synonym classifiers. The evaluation experiment has shown a dramatic performance increase of over 120% on the F-1 measure basis, compared to the conventional similarity-based classification. On the other hand, the pattern-based features have appeared almost redundant.},

abstract = {Digital health interventions (DHIs) offer promising solutions to the rising global challenges of noncommunicable diseases by promoting behavior change, improving health outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs. However, high churn rates are a concern with DHIs, with many users disengaging before achieving desired outcomes. Churn prediction can help DHI providers identify and retain at-risk users, enhancing the efficacy of DHIs. We analyzed churn prediction models for a weight loss app using various machine learning algorithms on data from 1,283 users and 310,845 event logs. The best-performing model, a random forest model that only used daily login counts, achieved an F1 score of 0.87 on day 7 and identified an average of 93% of churned users during the week-long trial. Notably, higher-dimensional models performed better at low false positive rate thresholds. Our findings suggest that user churn can be forecasted using engagement data, aiding in timely personalized strategies and better health results.},

abstract = {Molecular biology prediction tasks suffer the limited labeled data problem since it normally demands a series of professional experiments to label the target molecule. Self-training is one of the semi-supervised learning paradigms that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data. It trains a teacher model on labeled data, and uses it to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data. The labeled and pseudo-labeled data are then combined to train a student model. However, the pseudo labels generated from the teacher model are not sufficiently accurate. Thus, we propose a robust self-training strategy by exploring robust loss function to handle such noisy labels, which is model and task agnostic, and can be easily embedded with any prediction tasks. We have conducted molecular biology prediction tasks to gradually evaluate the performance of proposed robust self-training strategy. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently boosts the prediction performance, especially for molecular regression tasks, which have gained a 41.5% average improvement.},

abstract = {Discovering time-aware interactions among spatial objects is essential for various urban applications, such as offline advertising and public transport planning. Although previous studies have focused on identifying static relationships among spatial objects, little attention has been given to investigating dynamic location interactions. However, the availability of urban data through human activity creates new opportunities to understand the evolving relationships between connected objects. Therefore, we introduce a new problem of determining multiple interactions among spatial objects to address the challenge of integrating dynamic and spatial impact under interacting sparsity constraints. To tackle this problem, we propose a graph learning solution that leverages an Evolving Graph Neural Network (EGNN) consisting of two collaborative components: a Cross Spatial-Interaction Propagation (CSIP) and an Evolving Self-Supervised Learning (ESSL) module. CSIP enables aggregation within- and propagation across time segments to capture evolving context within a spatial scope from the perspective of message passing between placements. ESSL employs time-aware learning with global and local loss reduction and introduces an additional evolving constraint to consider sparsity of interactions in spatial representation learning. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm in designing novel interaction methods, involving gestures, speech, text, touch and brain-controlled interaction, embedded in innovative and emerging human–computer interfaces. These interfaces support ubiquitous interaction with applications and services running on smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle systems, virtual and augmented reality, robotic systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many other domains that are now highly competitive, both in commercial and in research contexts.This book presents the crucial theoretical foundations needed by any student, researcher, or practitioner working on novel interface design, with chapters on statistical methods, digital signal processing (DSP), and machine learning (ML). These foundations are followed by chapters that discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces, probabilistic mobile text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces. The case studies chapters also highlight an in-depth look at the practical application of DSP and ML methods used for processing of touch, gesture, biometric, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout the case studies is ubiquitous support for humans in their daily professional or personal activities.In addition, the book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal and multi-sensor systems. In a series of short additions to each chapter, an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the emergent deep concerns of the professional community, on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during ubiquitous interaction with omnipresent computers.This carefully edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the fields of DSP and ML. It provides a textbook for students and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working on interaction design on emerging platforms.}

However, current EEG-based workload estimation may not be robust enough for some practical applications. Indeed, the currently obtained workload classification accuracies are relatively low, making the resulting estimations not fully trustable. This paper thus studies promising modern machine learning algorithms, including Riemannian geometry-based methods and Deep Learning, to estimate workload from EEG signals. We study them with both user-specific and user-independent calibration, to go towards calibration-free systems. Our results suggested that a shallow Convolutional Neural Network obtained the best performance in both conditions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on the used data sets. This suggests that Deep Learning can bring new possibilities in HCI.},

Prior research has shown the benefits of combining data from multiple sources compared to traditional unimodal data that has led to the development of many novel multimodal architectures. However, the lack of consistent terminologies and architectural descriptions makes it difficult to compare different solutions. We address these challenges by proposing a new taxonomy for describing multimodal classification models based on trends found in recent publications. Examples of how this taxonomy could be applied to existing models are presented as well as a checklist to aid in the clear and complete presentation of future models. Many of the most difficult aspects of unimodal classification have not yet been fully addressed for multimodal datasets, including big data, class imbalance, and instance-level difficulty. We also provide a discussion of these challenges and future directions of research.},

abstract = {The goal of causal classification is to identify individuals whose outcome would be positively changed by a treatment. Examples include targeting advertisements and targeting retention incentives to reduce churn. Causal classification is challenging because we observe individuals under only one condition (treated or untreated), so we do not know who was inuenced by the treatment, but we may estimate the potential outcomes under each condition to decide whom to treat by estimating treatment effects. Curiously, we often see practitioners using simple outcome prediction instead, for example, predicting if someone will purchase if shown the ad. Rather than disregarding this as naive behavior, we present a theoretical analysis comparing treatment effect estimation and outcome prediction when addressing causal classification. We focus on the key question: "When (if ever) is simple outcome prediction preferable to treatment effect estimation for causal classification?" The analysis reveals a causal bias-variance tradeoff. First, when the treatment effect estimation depends on two outcome predictions, larger sampling variance may lead to more errors than the (biased) outcome prediction approach. Second, a stronger signal-to-noise ratio in outcome prediction implies that the bias can help with intervention decisions when outcomes are informative of effects. The theoretical results, as well as simulations, illustrate settings where outcome prediction should actually be better, including cases where (1) the bias may be partially corrected by choosing a different threshold, (2) outcomes and treatment effects are correlated, and (3) data to estimate counterfactuals are limited. A major practical implication is that, for some applications, it might be feasible to make good intervention decisions without any data on how individuals actually behave when intervened. Finally, we show that for a real online advertising application, outcome prediction models indeed excel at causal classification.},

abstract = {Meta-Learning aims to speed up the learning process on new tasks by acquiring useful inductive biases from datasets of related learning tasks. While, in practice, the number of related tasks available is often small, most of the existing approaches assume an abundance of tasks; making them unrealistic and prone to overfitting. A central question in the meta-learning literature is how to regularize to ensure generalization to unseen tasks. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis using the PAC-Bayesian theory and present a generalization bound for meta-learning, which was first derived by Rothfuss et al. (2021a). Crucially, the bound allows us to derive the closed form of the optimal hyper-posterior, referred to as PACOH, which leads to the best performance guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis and empirical case study under which conditions and to what extent these guarantees for meta-learning improve upon PAC-Bayesian per-task learning bounds. The closed-form PACOH inspires a practical meta-learning approach that avoids the reliance on bi-level optimization, giving rise to a stochastic optimization problem that is amenable to standard variational methods that scale well. Our experiments show that, when instantiating the PACOH with Gaussian processes and Bayesian Neural Networks models, the resulting methods are more scalable, and yield state-of-the-art performance, both in terms of predictive accuracy and the quality of uncertainty estimates.},

abstract = {The growing ubiquity of sensors in mobile phones has opened many opportunities for personal daily activity sensing. Most context recognition systems require a cumbersome preparation by collecting and manually annotating training examples. Recently, mining online crowd-generated repositories for free annotated training data has been proposed to build context models. A crowd-generated dataset can capture a large variety both in terms of class number and in intra-class diversity, but may not cover all user-specific contexts. Thus, performance is often significantly worse than that of user-centric training. In this work, we exploit for the first time the combination of both crowd-generated audio dataset available in the web and unlabeled audio data obtained from users' mobile phones. We use a semi-supervised Gaussian mixture model to combine labeled data from the crowd-generated database and unlabeled personal recording data. Hereby we refine generic knowledge with data from the user to train a personalized model. This technique has been tested on 7 users on mobile phones with a total data of 14 days and up to 9 context classes. Preliminary results show that a semi-supervised model can improve the recognition accuracy up to 21%.},

abstract = {Nowadays, companies wishing to get exposure and increase revenues need Internet visibility, and particularly get on the top of Search Engines Results Pages (SERP). Meanwhile, in the last two decades, data science became a vital part of many industries to get quick insights and valuable information, including online marketing and Search Engine Optimization (SEO). With 90% market share worldwide, Google is a search engine using an algorithm to query billions of pages with more than 200 factors that all marketers want to discover. As consequence, some applications are existing to get insights about SEO factors relative to webpages. However, it does not exist a tool able to collect large quantities of URLs and analyze them relative to on-page factors. Therefore, a custom tool "SEOnaozi" was developed for this purpose. This article tries different machine learning algorithms to evaluate the SEO tool and determine how effective it can be to improve SEO analysis. For this purpose, three datasets for a total of 50,000 observations were tested with two scenarios: one using a selection of 8 features, the other with 23 features, including 15 on-pages features. According to the research result, it leads that the tool "SEOnaozi" is efficient because all metrics mostly improved when on-pages features are used by algorithms. Moreover, it was found that Catboost could produce the best results among others to predict an URL to be on Google Top10 SERP.},

abstract = {Traditional multi-dimensional classification (MDC) methods often assume that optimizing a single objective can improve overall performance, thus meeting the requirements of various applications. However, achieving optimal performance in MDC typically involves balancing trade-offs among multiple objectives or metrics. Consequently, this paper investigates the problem of multi-objective MDC. To overcome the limitations of random coding matrix A generation in the sparse labeled encoding-based MDC method (SLEM), a novel MDC method based on the NSGA-III algorithm, is proposed, named N3MDC. First, the NSGA-III algorithm is employed for iterative optimization to obtain an optimal set of non-dominated solutions for the targeted objectives. Then, based on preferences for unseen instances and the proposed model selection strategy, the optimal solution is selected and used as coding matrix A. Finally, using the generated coding matrix A, cascade operations of encoding, training, and decoding are performed to predict the class vectors of the unseen instances. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive comparative experiments were conducted using 8 state-of-the-art MDC methods on 11 publicly available datasets, each representing a distinct real-world application problem. The results show that the N3MDC method delivers superior generalization performance compared to the benchmark methods.},

abstract = {Outsourcing machine learning inference creates a confidentiality dilemma: either the client has to trust the server with potentially sensitive input data, or the server has to share his commercially valuable model. Known remedies include homomorphic encryption, multi-party computation, or placing the entire model in a trusted enclave. None of these are suitable for large models. For two relevant use cases, we show that it is possible to keep all confidential model parameters in the last (dense) layers of deep neural networks. This allows us to split the model such that the confidential parts fit into a trusted enclave on the client side. We present the eNNclave toolchain to cut TensorFlow models at any layer, splitting them into public and enclaved layers. This preserves TensorFlow's performance optimizations and hardware support for public layers, while keeping the parameters of the enclaved layers private. Evaluations on several machine learning tasks spanning multiple domains show that fast inference is possible while keeping the sensitive model parameters confidential. Accuracy results are close to the baseline where all layers carry sensitive information and confirm our approach is practical.},

abstract = {Transformer based code models have impressive performance in many software engineering tasks. However, their effectiveness degrades when symbols are missing or not informative. The reason is that the model may not learn to pay attention to the right correlations/contexts without the help of symbols. We propose a new method to pre-train general code models when symbols are lacking. We observe that in such cases, programs degenerate to something written in a very primitive language. We hence propose to use program analysis to extract contexts a priori (instead of relying on symbols and masked language modeling as in vanilla models). We then leverage a novel attention masking method to only allow the model attending to these contexts, e.g., bi-directional program dependence transitive closures and token co-occurrences. In the meantime, the inherent self-attention mechanism is utilized to learn which of the allowed attentions are more important compared to others. To realize the idea, we enhance the vanilla tokenization and model architecture of a BERT model, 
 
construct and utilize attention masks, and introduce a new pre-training algorithm. We pre-train this BERT-like model from scratch, using a dataset of 26 million stripped binary functions with explicit program dependence information extracted by our tool. We apply the model in three downstream tasks: binary similarity, type inference, and malware family classification. Our pre-trained model can improve the SOTAs in these tasks from 53% to 64%, 49% to 60%, and 74% to 94%, respectively. It also substantially outperforms other general pre-training techniques of code understanding models.},

abstract = {Event detection (ED) aims to entail the identification of triggers in text and the determination of the appropriate categories. Event detection is frequently hampered by labeled data scarcity, and most current methods ignore the correlations between events. Aiming at the issues, a novel event detection framework leveraging semantic space and event knowledge (EDSSEK) is proposed. To introduce event knowledge, the pre-trained model is extended and fine-tuned based on the elaborately constructed domain corpus. The presentations of event types are encoded through the pre-trained model and mapped into the semantic space. The feature vectors of event triggers are gained using a document-level attention mechanism and then projected into the same vector space. The document embedding networks are trained by minimizing the distances between the event triggers and the relevant types. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that EDSSEK outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, and justify the effectiveness of semantic space combined with event knowledge.},

abstract = {In the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), counterfactual examples explain to a user the predictions of a trained decision model by indicating the modifications to be made to the instance so as to change its associated prediction. These counterfactual examples are generally defined as solutions to an optimization problem whose cost function combines several criteria that quantify desiderata for a good explanation meeting user needs. A large variety of such appropriate properties can be considered, as the user needs are generally unknown and differ from one user to another; their selection and formalization is difficult. To circumvent this issue, several approaches propose to generate, rather than a single one, a set of diverse counterfactual examples to explain a prediction. This paper proposes a review of the numerous, sometimes conflicting, definitions that have been proposed for this notion of diversity. It discusses their underlying principles as well as the hypotheses on the user needs they rely on and proposes to categorize them along several dimensions (explicit vs implicit, universe in which they are defined, level at which they apply), leading to the identification of further research challenges on this topic.},

abstract = {Deep learning has recently demonstrated state-of-the art performance on key tasks related to the maintenance of computer systems, such as intrusion detection, denial of service attack detection, hardware and software system failures, and malware detection. In these contexts, model interpretability is vital for administrator and analyst to trust and act on the automated analysis of machine learning models. Deep learning methods have been criticized as black box oracles which allow limited insight into decision factors. In this work we seek to bridge the gap between the impressive performance of deep learning models and the need for interpretable model introspection. To this end we present recurrent neural network (RNN) language models augmented with attention for anomaly detection in system logs. Our methods are generally applicable to any computer system and logging source. By incorporating attention variants into our RNN language models we create opportunities for model introspection and analysis without sacrificing state-of-the art performance. We demonstrate model performance and illustrate model interpretability on an intrusion detection task using the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) cyber security dataset, reporting upward of 0.99 area under the receiver operator characteristic curve despite being trained only on a single day's worth of data.},

This results in the inability to correctly reflect the differences between documents of different categories. This paper proposes an improved feature weighting algorithm FDCD-TF-IDF based on word frequency distribution information and category distribution information. The improved algorithm introduces the concept of word frequency distribution and class distribution to describe the weight of the feature item more accurately. The word frequency distribution is mainly aimed at the correlation between feature items and categories, and the category distribution can better reflect category information of feature items. This improved algorithm can accurately reflect the differences between different text categories. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm can achieve better classification results on both balanced and unbalanced text data sets.},

abstract = {Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) is an important brain imaging tool for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, limited sMRI training data deeply constrain computer-aided diagnostic methods, especially for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. Besides, the pathological differences are subtle among different types of the MCI stage, further increasing the difficulty of diagnosing MCI subtypes. Recent studies explore transfer learning to address the above issues, but most of them are limited to parameter transfer, which only endows with good initialization parameters at the beginning of the training, and results in suboptimal performance. In this work, we integrate transfer learning and adversarial learning. The former uses sMRI scans from Alzheimer's patients and cognitively normal subjects (CN) as source data to compensate for the shortage of MCI training data. The latter achieves alignment of source and target domain feature representations utilizing source prior knowledge, where model on the source is easier to learn more discriminative feature representations than on the target. As a result, the model can achieve good discrimination on the target task. Extensive experiments on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Especially, we achieve 79.24% accuracy on mild cognitive impairment conversion prediction task. We also achieve good performance on other two AD-related diagnosis tasks.},

abstract = {Modern learning algorithms excel at producing accurate but complex models of the data. However, deploying such models in the real-world requires extra care: we must ensure their reliability, robustness, and absence of undesired biases. This motivates the development of models that are equally accurate but can be also easily inspected and assessed beyond their predictive performance. To this end, we introduce contextual explanation networks (CENs)-- a class of architectures that learn to predict by generating and utilizing intermediate, simplified probabilistic models. Specifically, CENs generate parameters for intermediate graphical models which are further used for prediction and play the role of explanations. Contrary to the existing post-hoc model-explanation tools, CENs learn to predict and to explain simultaneously. Our approach offers two major advantages: (i) for each prediction, valid, instance-specific explanation is generated with no computational overhead and (ii) prediction via explanation acts as a regularizer and boosts performance in data-scarce settings. We analyze the proposed framework theoretically and experimentally. Our results on image and text classification and survival analysis tasks demonstrate that CENs are not only competitive with the state-of-the-art methods but also offer additional insights behind each prediction, that can be valuable for decision support. We also show that while post-hoc methods may produce misleading explanations in certain cases, CENs are consistent and allow to detect such cases systematically.},

abstract = {In the past decades, recommender systems have attracted much attention in both research and industry communities. Existing recommendation models mainly learn the underlying user preference from historical behavior data (typically in the forms of item IDs), and then estimate the user-item matching relationships for recommendations. Inspired by the recent progress on large language models (LLMs), we develop a different recommendation paradigm, considering recommendation as instruction following by LLMs. The key idea is that the needs of a user can be expressed in natural language descriptions (called instructions), so that LLMs can understand and further execute the instruction for fulfilling the recommendation. For this purpose, we instruction tune the 3B Flan-T5-XL, to better adapt LLMs to recommender systems. We first design a general instruction format for describing the preference, intention, and task form of a user in natural language. Then we manually design 39 instruction templates and automatically generate large amounts of user-personalized instruction data with varying types of preferences and intentions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we instantiate the instructions into several widely studied recommendation (or search) tasks, and conduct extensive experiments with real-world datasets. Experiment results show that our approach can outperform several competitive baselines, including the powerful GPT-3.5, on these evaluation tasks. Our approach sheds light on developing user-friendly recommender systems, in which users can freely communicate with the system and obtain accurate recommendations via natural language instructions.},

abstract = {Over the years cloud computing has seen significant evolution in terms of improvement in infrastructure and resource provisioning. However the continuous emergence of new applications such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) with thousands of users put a significant load on cloud infrastructure. Load balancing of resource allocation in cloud-oriented IoT is a critical factor that has a significant impact on the smooth operation of cloud services and customer satisfaction. Several load balancing strategies for cloud environment have been proposed in the past. However the existing approaches mostly consider only a few parameters and ignore many critical factors having a pivotal role in load balancing leading to less optimized resource allocation. Load balancing is a challenging problem and therefore the research community has recently focused towards employing machine learning-based metaheuristic approaches for load balancing in the cloud. In this paper we propose a metaheuristics-based scheme Data Format Classification using Support Vector Machine (DFC-SVM), to deal with the load balancing problem. The proposed scheme aims to reduce the online load balancing complexity by offline-based pre-classification of raw-data from diverse sources (such as IoT) into different formats e.g. text images media etc. SVM is utilized to classify “n” types of data formats featuring audio video text digital images and maps etc. A one-to-many classification approach has been developed so that data formats from the cloud are initially classified into their respective classes and assigned to virtual machines through the proposed modified version of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) which schedules the data of a particular class efficiently. The experimental results compared with the baselines have shown a significant improvement in the performance of the proposed approach. Overall an average of 94% classification accuracy is achieved along with 11.82% less energy 16% less response time and 16.08% fewer SLA violations are observed.},

By doing so, ORXESTRA effectively accounts for the processor micro-architecture without explicitly modeling micro-architectural elements such as caches, pipelines, and branch predictors. Our evaluations demonstrate ORXESTRA's ability to provide precise timing estimations for different ARM targets (Cortex M4, M7, A53, and A72), surpassing existing machine learning-based approaches in both prediction accuracy and prediction speed.},

This paper studies the debiasing problem in the context of image classification tasks. Our data analysis on facial attribute recognition demonstrates (1) the attribution of model bias from imbalanced training data distribution and (2) the potential of adversarial examples in balancing data distribution. We are thus motivated to employ adversarial example to augment the training data for visual debiasing. Specifically, to ensure the adversarial generalization as well as cross-task transferability, we propose to couple the operations of target task classifier training, bias task classifier training, and adversarial example generation. The generated adversarial examples supplement the target task training dataset via balancing the distribution over bias variables in an online fashion. Results on simulated and real-world debiasing experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in simultaneously improving model accuracy and fairness. Preliminary experiment on few-shot learning further shows the potential of adversarial attack-based pseudo sample generation as alternative solution to make up for the training data lackage.},

abstract = {Counterfactual examples (CFs) are one of the most popular methods for attaching post-hoc explanations to machine learning (ML) models. However, existing CF generation methods either exploit the internals of specific models or depend on each sample's neighborhood, thus they are hard to generalize for complex models and inefficient for large datasets. This work aims to overcome these limitations and introduces ReLAX, a model-agnostic algorithm to generate optimal counterfactual explanations. Specifically, we formulate the problem of crafting CFs as a sequential decision-making task and then find the optimal CFs via deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with discrete-continuous hybrid action space. Extensive experiments conducted on several tabular datasets have shown that ReLAX outperforms existing CF generation baselines, as it produces sparser counterfactuals, is more scalable to complex target models to explain, and generalizes to both classification and regression tasks. Finally, to demonstrate the usefulness of our method in a real-world use case, we leverage CFs generated by ReLAX to suggest actions that a country should take to reduce the risk of mortality due to COVID-19. Interestingly enough, the actions recommended by our method correspond to the strategies that many countries have actually implemented to counter the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is crucial to smart grid, which enables applications such as energy conservation and human activity recognition. As a typical task of NILM, energy disaggregation is to decompose total power consumption into appliance-level ones. Despite the remarkable achievements of deep-learning-based methods, their training phase still requires intrusively collected appliance-level power data as strong labels, which are directly used for supervising predictions.In this paper, we present ESATED, a novel energy disaggregation system which instead utilizes non-intrusively collected binary on-off states of appliances as labels, thus enhancing non-intrusiveness throughout the life cycle. However, our labels are inherently weak labels due to the weak correlation between labels (binary states) and predictions (real-valued power), thus making our model struggle in terms of feasible supervision and acceptable performance. To tackle this challenge, we first explore the feasibility of binary-state-based weak supervision, and then integrate it into an auxiliary learning system, where an auxiliary subtask (i.e., state classification) is introduced to further enhance the performance of the primary task (i.e., energy disaggregation). We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world public datasets, and also implement the prototype system in a practical scenario. Corresponding results reveal that even using weak labels, ESATED could achieve performance and transferability second only to the state-of-the-art model. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach to extract information and train the model from extra weak labels.},

abstract = {Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) represents the predominant framework in Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, covering aspects such as sub-typing, diagnosis, and beyond. Current MIL models predominantly rely on instance-level features derived from pretrained models such as ResNet. These models segment each WSI into independent patches and extract features from these local patches, leading to a significant loss of global spatial context and restricting the model's focus to merely local features. To address this issue, we propose a novel MIL framework, named SAM-MIL, that emphasizes spatial contextual awareness and explicitly incorporates spatial context by extracting comprehensive, image-level information. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a pioneering visual segmentation foundational model that can capture segmentation features without the need for additional fine-tuning, rendering it an outstanding tool for extracting spatial context directly from raw WSIs. Our approach includes the design of group feature extraction based on spatial context and a SAM-Guided Group Masking strategy to mitigate class imbalance issues. We implement a dynamic mask ratio for different segmentation categories and supplement these with representative group features of categories. Moreover, SAM-MIL divides instances to generate additional pseudo-bags, thereby augmenting the training set, and introduces consistency of spatial context across pseudo-bags to further enhance the model's performance. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16 and TCGA Lung Cancer datasets demonstrate that our proposed SAM-MIL model outperforms existing mainstream methods in WSIs classification.

abstract = {Advancements in computer vision, natural language processing and deep learning techniques have resulted in the creation of intelligent systems that have achieved impressive results in the visually grounded tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). VQA is a task that can be used to evaluate a system's capacity to understand an image. It requires an intelligent agent to answer a natural language question about an image. The agent must ground the question into the image and return a natural language answer. One of the latest techniques proposed to tackle this task is the attention mechanism. It allows the agent to focus on specific parts of the input in order to answer the question. In this paper we propose a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture that uses dual attention to focus on specific question words and parts of the input image in order to generate the answer.

abstract = {The Sussex-Huawei Locomotion Challenge 2019 was an open competition in activity recognition where the participants were tasked with recognizing eight different modes of locomotion and transportation. The main difficulty of the challenge is that the training data was recorded with a smartphone that was placed in a different body location than the test data. Only a small validation set with all locations was provided to enable transfer learning. This paper describes our (team JSI First) approach, in which we first derived additional sensor streams from the existing ones and on them calculated a large body of features. We then used cross-location transfer learning via specialized feature selection, and performed two-step classification. Finally, we used Hidden Markov Models to alter the predictions in order to take their temporal dependencies into account. Internal tests using this methodology yielded an accuracy of 83%.},

This article presents a novel neural network architecture that can extract and classify events from Arabic sentences. The model combines word representations and Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags and uses a bidirectional LSTM layer and a dual combined convolutional neural network. The first layer of the network focuses on sentence representations, while the second layer focuses on POS representations. The model takes advantage of both N-gram character features from FastText and contextual representations from bidirectional encoder representations from transformers. This combination proves to be successful, as evidenced by the good results obtained from evaluating the model on the Arabic TimeML corpus. Our results show that combining both contextual and N-gram representations outperforms the traditional skip-gram model.},

However, researchers sometimes struggle to make sense of nuanced connections between recommended papers and their own research context, as existing systems only present paper titles and abstracts. To help researchers spot these connections, we present PaperWeaver, an enriched paper alerts system that provides contextualized text descriptions of recommended papers based on user-collected papers. PaperWeaver employs a computational method based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer users’ research interests from their collected papers, extract context-specific aspects of papers, and compare recommended and collected papers on these aspects. Our user study (N=15) showed that participants using PaperWeaver were able to better understand the relevance of recommended papers and triage them more confidently when compared to a baseline that presented the related work sections from recommended papers.},

abstract = {Social media platforms have made increasing use of irony in recent years. Users can express their ironic thoughts with audio, video, and images attached to text content. When you use irony, you are making fun of a situation or trying to make a point. It can also express frustration or highlight the absurdity of a situation. The use of irony in social media is likely to continue to increase, no matter the reason. By using syntactic information in conjunction with semantic exploration, we show that attention networks can be enhanced. Using learned embedding, unsupervised learning encodes word order into a joint space. By evaluating the entropy of an example class and adding instances, the active learning method uses the shared representation as a query to retrieve semantically similar sentences from a knowledge base. In this way, the algorithm can identify the instance with the maximum uncertainty and extract the most informative example from the training set. An ironic network trained for each labelled record is used to train a classifier (model). The partial training model and the original labelled data generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. To correctly predict the label of a dataset, a classifier (attention network) updates the pseudo-labels for the remaining datasets. After the experimental evaluation of the 1,021 annotated texts, the proposed model performed better than the baseline models, achieving an F1 score of 0.63 on ironic tasks and 0.59 on non-ironic tasks. We also found that the proposed model generalized well to new instances of datasets.},

abstract = {The intelligent dialogue system, aiming at communicating with humans harmoniously with natural language, is brilliant for promoting the advancement of human-machine interaction in the era of artificial intelligence. With the gradually complex human-computer interaction requirements, it is difficult for traditional text-based dialogue system to meet the demands for more vivid and convenient interaction. Consequently, Visual-Context Augmented Dialogue (VAD) System, which has the potential to communicate with humans by perceiving and understanding multimodal information (i.e., visual context in images or videos, textual dialogue history), has become a predominant research paradigm. Benefiting from the consistency and complementarity between visual and textual context, VAD possesses the potential to generate engaging and context-aware responses. To depict the development of VAD, we first characterize the concept model of VAD and then present its generic system architecture to illustrate the system workflow, followed by a summary of multimodal fusion techniques. Subsequently, several research challenges and representative works are investigated, followed by the summary of authoritative benchmarks and real-world application of VAD. We conclude this article by putting forward some open issues and promising research trends for VAD, e.g., the cognitive mechanisms of human-machine dialogue under cross-modal dialogue context, mobile and lightweight deployment of VAD.},

abstract = {In the information retrieval community, Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) has become increasingly popular. Documents focused on the time surrounding their publication are more likely to be accurate and contain information relevant to the reader. In this study, we explore the inverted pyramid paradigm by extracting temporal expressions from news documents, standardizing their values, and evaluating them based on their position within the text. We present a lexicon expansion method that employs WordNet as input. This approach enhances the lexicon by grouping words with similar meanings, potentially improving the accuracy of event detection algorithms. Additionally, this process can introduce new words and phrases to the lexicon, expanding the vocabulary. Using each tagged dataset, a classifier is trained with a pre-trained network. A pool of unlabeled data are processed, and high-confidence pseudo-labels are assigned. Pseudo-labels are generated by leveraging the partially trained model and the original labelled data. As the classifier predicts the correct label for a data sample, the pseudo-labels of other data samples are updated, and vice versa. At the end of this process, the predictions from different matching classifiers are combined. It takes several rounds to label the unlabeled inputs using this method. To evaluate the proposed solutions, we conducted experiments on 4,500 online news articles relevant to temporal retrieval. LSTM, BiLSTM, and BERT models with and without lexicon expansion were assessed based on log loss and relative divergence of entropy. A jointly trained semi-supervised learning model achieved a mean KL divergence of 0.89, an F1 score of 0.74 for temporal events, and 0.63 for non-temporal events. Besides alleviating data sparsity issues and enabling the training of more complex networks, this technique can also serve as an alternative to data augmentation methods.},

In this paper we propose an ontology-based user interaction context model (UICO) that enhances the performance of task detection on the user's computer desktop. Starting from low-level contextual attention meta-data captured from the user's desktop, we utilize rule-based, information extraction and machine learning approaches to automatically populate this user interaction context model. Furthermore we automatically derive relations between the model's entities and automatically detect the user's task. We present evaluation results of a large-scale user study we carried out in a knowledge-intensive business environment, which support our approach.},

abstract = {The open and broadcast nature of wireless mediums introduces significant security vulnerabilities, making authentication a critical concern in wireless networks. In recent years, Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA) techniques have garnered considerable research interest due to their advantages over Upper-Layer Authentication (ULA) methods, such as lower complexity, enhanced security, and greater compatibility. The application of signal processing techniques in PLA serves as a crucial link between the extraction of Physical-Layer Features (PLFs) and the authentication of received signals. Different signal processing approaches, even with the same PLF, can result in varying authentication performances and computational demands. Despite this, there remains a shortage of comprehensive overviews on state-of-the-art PLA schemes with a focus on signal processing approaches. This article presents the first thorough survey of signal processing in various PLA schemes, categorizing existing approaches into model-based and Machine Learning (ML)-based schemes. We discuss motivation and address key issues in signal processing for PLA schemes. The applications, challenges, and future research directions of PLA are discussed in Part 3 of the Appendix, which can be found in supplementary materials online.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach for trajectory anomaly detection using an autoregressive causal-attention model, termed LM-TAD. This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.

Images are captured naturalistically while participants respond to the PHQ-8 depression survey question: “I have felt down, depressed, or hopeless”. Our analysis explores important image attributes, such as angle, dominant colors, location, objects, and lighting. We show that a random forest trained with face landmarks can classify samples as depressed or non-depressed and predict raw PHQ-8 scores effectively. Our post-hoc analysis provides several insights through an ablation study, feature importance analysis, and bias assessment. Importantly, we evaluate user concerns about using MoodCapture to detect depression based on sharing photos, providing critical insights into privacy concerns that inform the future design of in-the-wild image-based mental health assessment tools.},

abstract = {Mobile sensing is a ubiquitous and useful tool to make inferences about individuals' mental health based on physiology and behavior patterns. Along with sensing features directly associated with mental health, it can be valuable to detect different features of social contexts to learn about social interaction patterns over time and across different environments. This can provide insight into diverse communities' academic, work and social lives, and their social networks. We posit that passively detecting social contexts can be particularly useful for social anxiety research, as it may ultimately help identify changes in social anxiety status and patterns of social avoidance and withdrawal. To this end, we recruited a sample of highly socially anxious undergraduate students (N=46) to examine whether we could detect the presence of experimentally manipulated virtual social contexts via wristband sensors. Using a multitask machine learning pipeline, we leveraged passively sensed biobehavioral streams to detect contexts relevant to social anxiety, including (1) whether people were in a social situation, (2) size of the social group, (3) degree of social evaluation, and (4) phase of social situation (anticipating, actively experiencing, or had just participated in an experience). Results demonstrated the feasibility of detecting most virtual social contexts, with stronger predictive accuracy when detecting whether individuals were in a social situation or not and the phase of the situation, and weaker predictive accuracy when detecting the level of social evaluation. They also indicated that sensing streams are differentially important to prediction based on the context being predicted. Our findings also provide useful information regarding design elements relevant to passive context detection, including optimal sensing duration, the utility of different sensing modalities, and the need for personalization. We discuss implications of these findings for future work on context detection (e.g., just-in-time adaptive intervention development).},

EMAs allow for temporally dense, ecologically valid data collection, but frequent interruptions with lengthy surveys on mobile devices can burden users, impacting compliance and data quality. We propose a method that reduces the length of each EMA question set measuring interrelated constructs, with only modest information loss. By estimating the potential information gain of each EMA question using question-answer prediction models, this method can prioritize the presentation of the most informative question in a question-by-question sequence and skip uninformative questions. We evaluated the proposed method by simulating question omission using four real-world datasets from three different EMA studies. When compared against the random question omission approach that skips 50% of the questions, our method reduces imputation errors by 15%-52%. In surveys with five answer options for each question, our method can reduce the mean survey length by 34%-56% with a real-time prediction accuracy of 72%-95% for the skipped questions. The proposed method may either allow more constructs to be surveyed without adding user burden or reduce response burden for more sustainable longitudinal EMA data collection.},

Identification of dominant emotion solely based on the text data generated by humans is essential for the modern human–computer interaction. This work presents a multimodal text-keystrokes dataset and associated learning methods for the identification of human emotions hidden in small text. For this, a text-keystrokes data of 69 participants is collected in multiple scenarios. Stimuli are induced through videos in a controlled environment. After the stimuli induction, participants write their reviews about the given scenario in an unguided manner. Afterward, keystroke and in-text features are extracted from the dataset. These are used with an assortment of learning methods to identify emotion hidden in the short text. An accuracy of 86.95% is achieved by fusing text and keystroke features. Whereas, 100% accuracy is obtained for pleasure-displeasure classes of emotions using the fusion of keystroke/text features, tree-based feature selection method, and support vector machine classifier. The present work is also compared with four state-of-the-art techniques for the same task, where the results suggest that the present proposal performs better in terms of accuracy.},

abstract = {According to the World Health Organization, suicide is a major social problem and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Mental health, financial distress and loss of social ties are among the most common causes of suicide. With the widespread use of social media in the 21st century and the freedom of expression that comes with it, people with suicidal thoughts often share their thoughts through these digital platforms. Early detection of suicidal thoughts is essential to prevent harm and save lives. To this end, this article proposes an oversampling method to detect suicidal ideation. The proposed approach uses SMOTE and ADASYN techniques to equalize the sample size and then implements neural networks and machine learning models for early detection of suicidal thoughts. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we apply it to balanced and unbalanced data sets and measure its precision, memory, F1 score and accuracy. In addition, we create the ROC curve to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach is superior to existing methods for suicidal ideation detection.},

abstract = {Determining if a Meningioma, which is a primary tumor of the brain, is firm or not guides patient counseling and the operative strategy to be adopted. In this paper we propose a novel approach for automatic firmness detection for Meningioma tumor. The proposed framework relies on a possibilistic based ensemble method to classify MRI image instances as firm or non-firm cases. The proposed algorithm minimizes some objective function which combines context identification and multi-algorithm ensemble criteria. The optimization is intended to learn contexts as compact clusters in subspaces of the visual feature space via possibilistic clustering and feature discrimination. The yields optimal ensemble parameters for each context. The experiments were conducted and assessed using a real dataset. The obtained performance proved that the proposed approach outperforms relevant state of the art methods.},

We focus on biological context as descriptions of the species, tissue type, and cell type that are associated with biochemical events. We present a new corpus of open access biomedical texts that have been annotated by biology subject matter experts to highlight context-event relations. Using this corpus, we evaluate several classifiers for context-event association along with a detailed analysis of the impact of a variety of linguistic features on classifier performance. We find that gradient tree boosting performs by far the best, achieving an F1 of 0.865 in a cross-validation study.},

abstract = {At present, the application of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification to human intention-behavior prediction has become a hot topic in the brain computer interface (BCI) research field. In recent studies, the introduction of convolutional neural networks (CNN) has contributed to substantial improvements in the EEG signal classification performance. However, there is still a key challenge with the existing CNN-based EEG signal classification methods, the accuracy of them is not very satisfying. This is because most of the existing methods only utilize the feature maps in the last layer of CNN for EEG signal classification, which might miss some local and detailed information for accurate classification. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a multi-scale CNN model-based EEG signal classification method. In this method, first, the EEG signals are preprocessed and converted to time-frequency images using the short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) technique. Then, a multi-scale CNN model is designed for EEG signal classification, which takes the converted time-frequency image as the input. Especially, in the designed multi-scale CNN model, both the local and global information is taken into consideration. The performance of the proposed method is verified on the benchmark data set 2b used in the BCI contest IV. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed method is 73.9 percent, which improves the classification accuracy of 10.4, 5.5, 16.2 percent compared with the traditional methods including artificial neural network, support vector machine, and stacked auto-encoder.},

abstract = {Millions of people are affected by stuttering and other speech disfluencies, with the majority of the world having experienced mild stutters while communicating under stressful conditions. While there has been much research in the field of automatic speech recognition and language models, stutter detection and recognition has not received as much attention. To this end, we propose an end-to-end deep neural network, FluentNet, capable of detecting a number of different stutter types. FluentNet consists of a Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual convolutional neural network which facilitate the learning of strong spectral frame-level representations, followed by a set of bidirectional long short-term memory layers that aid in learning effective temporal relationships. Lastly, FluentNet uses an attention mechanism to focus on the important parts of speech to obtain a better performance. We perform a number of different experiments, comparisons, and ablation studies to evaluate our model. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results by outperforming other solutions in the field on the publicly available UCLASS dataset. Additionally, we present LibriStutter: a stuttered speech dataset based on the public LibriSpeech dataset with synthesized stutters. We also evaluate FluentNet on this dataset, showing the strong performance of our model versus a number of baseline and state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {In recent years, the academic communities have proposed a number of discriminative methods for solving the cross-age face verification task, and achieved considerable results. However, these methods are based on the supervising information provided by the category labels and do not consider the potential of the deep feature space. Therefore, we propose a novel network called identity-preserved multi-task convolutional neural network (IPMT-CNN), which combines an identity subnet with an auxiliary age subnet. In the meanwhile, the identity-preserved module is added to the deep feature space to constrain the deep features, making the deep features learned by the convolution unit have preliminary age-invariant property. The two subnets extract the identity-related features and the age-related features from the deep features shared by the convolution unit, respectively. Identity-related features are used for final cross-age face verification. Through multi-task supervised learning, the network can obtain strong discriminative age-invariant face features with identity-preserved capability. Experiments have been performed on two public domain benchmark aging datasets, including CACD-VS and Cross Age LFW. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our model.},

abstract = {Many data sets can be viewed as a noisy sampling of an underlying space, and tools from topological data analysis can characterize this structure for the purpose of knowledge discovery. One such tool is persistent homology, which provides a multiscale description of the homological features within a data set. A useful representation of this homological information is a persistence diagram (PD). Efforts have been made to map PDs into spaces with additional structure valuable to machine learning tasks. We convert a PD to a finite-dimensional vector representation which we call a persistence image (PI), and prove the stability of this transformation with respect to small perturbations in the inputs. The discriminatory power of PIs is compared against existing methods, showing significant performance gains. We explore the use of PIs with vector-based machine learning tools, such as linear sparse support vector machines, which identify features containing discriminating topological information. Finally, high accuracy inference of parameter values from the dynamic output of a discrete dynamical system (the linked twist map) and a partial differential equation (the anisotropic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation) provide a novel application of the discriminatory power of PIs.},

abstract = {Recently, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is a challenging research area given its complex nature, and humans express emotional cues across various modalities such as language, facial expressions, and speech. Representation and fusion of features are the most crucial tasks in multimodal sentiment analysis research. However, in the current research, most methods ignore the importance of eliminating potential irrelevant features in the original features of each modality and cross-modal common feature. Moreover, the features extracted from all the modalities contain cluttered background noise and different occlusions noise, which negatively affects feature alignment. Different from these methods, we propose a novel Trimodal Collaborative Disentanglement Network (TCDN) to solve these problems in this paper. This work can obtain effective sentiment results on two aspects: i) Trimodal collaborative uses L1-norm to eliminate irrelevant features and unify the characteristics of the three modals (inter-modal). ii) Disentanglement network introduces an adversary noise by combining the original features of various single modalities and the common representation, alleviating the background noises within each modality (intra-modal). This inter-intra modal feature augmentation method is the first work to obtain the common representation by implementing data augmentation as far as we know. Extensive experiments are completed on two benchmark datasets, including MOSI and MOSEI, demonstrating the superiority of the TCDN model over the state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Melanoma is a lethal skin cancer that is increasingly threatening the public health system due to increased incidence rates and mortality rates. Early detection of the disease is vital for improved outcomes and the reduction of mortality rates. Skin cancer classification remains a challenging task in the field of dermatology. While self-attention mechanisms and large language models have gained traction in skin cancer detection research, there is still insufficient evidence demonstrating their superior performance compared to CNNs. Thus, further exploration of this area is warranted. Where the quest for the optimal CNN pretrained model persists. In this study, we address this gap by assessing various pretrained models to determine the most effective one for skin cancer classification. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach that leverages transfer learning to develop a multi-task model capable of providing more comprehensive prediction information from dermatological images. Unlike conventional single output classification tasks that rely solely on label prediction, our proposed model utilizes transfer learning techniques to extract valuable features from pretrained models, enhancing its ability to predict multiple tasks simultaneously. This novel approach not only advances the field of dermatology by improving classification accuracy but also meets the growing demand for more informative predictions in clinical settings.},

In this regard, we study EEG-based affect decoding from videos in arousal and valence classification tasks, considering the impact of signal length, window size for feature extraction, and frequency bands. We train both classic Machine Learning models (SVMs and k-NNs) and modern Deep Learning models (FCNNs and GTNs). Our results show that: (1)&nbsp;affect can be effectively decoded using less than 1 minute of EEG signal; (2)&nbsp;temporal windows of 6 and 10 seconds provide the best classification performance for classic Machine Learning models but Deep Learning models benefit from much shorter windows of 2 seconds; and (3)&nbsp;any model trained on the Beta band alone achieves similar (sometimes better) performance than when trained on all frequency bands. Taken together, our results indicate that affect decoding can work in more realistic conditions than currently assumed, thus becoming a viable technology for creating better interfaces and user models.},

Most TL algorithms are studied in the field of data improvement, doing some data extraction and transformation. However, it ignores that existing the additional information to improve the model’s accuracy, like Universum samples in the training data with privileged information. In this article, we focus on considering prior data to improve the TL algorithm, and the additional features also called privileged information are incorporated into the learning to improve the learning paradigm. In addition, we also carry out the Universum samples which do not belong to any indicated categories into the transfer learning paradigm to improve the utilization of prior knowledge. We propose a new TL Model (PU-TLSVM), in which each task with corresponding privileged features and Universum data is considered in the proposed model, so as to apply tasks with a priori data to the training stage. Then, we use Lagrange duality theorem to optimize our model to obtain the optimal discriminant for target task classification. Finally, we make a lot of predictions and tests to compare the actual effectiveness of the proposed method with the previous methods.

abstract = {Breast Cancer is a highly aggressive type of cancer generally formed in the cells of the breast. Despite significant advances in the treatment of primary breast cancer in the last decade, there is a dire need to attempt of an accurate predictive model for breast cancer prognosis prediction. Researchers from various disciplines are working together to develop methods to save people from this fatal disease. A good predictive model can help in correct prognosis prediction of breast cancer. This accurate prediction can have several benefits like detection of cancer in the early stage, spare patients from getting unnecessary treatment and medical expenses related to it. Previous works rely mostly on uni-modal data (selected gene expression)for predictive model design. In recent years, however, multi-modal cancer data sets have become available (gene expression, copy number alteration and clinical). Motivated by the enhancement of deep-learning based models, in the current study, we propose to use some deep-learning based predictive models in a stacked ensemble framework to improve the prognosis prediction of breast cancer from available multi-modal data sets. One of the unique advantages of the proposed approach lies in the architecture of the model. It is a two-stage model. Stage one uses a convolutional neural network for feature extraction, while stage two uses the extracted features as input to the stack-based ensemble model. The predictive performance evaluated using different performance measures shows that this model produces better result than already existing approaches. This model results in AUC value of 0.93 and accuracy of 90.2 percent at medium stringency level (Specificity = 95 percent and threshold = 0.45). Keras 2.2.1, along with Tensorflow 1.12, is used for implementing the source code of the model.

abstract = {This article proposes an approach to response generation using a Parallel Double Q-learning algorithm for dialog policy decision in a conversational system. First, a new semantic representation of the user's input sentence is presented by using the CKIP parser to derive the semantic dependency sequence of the input sentence. Then, a Gated Recurrent Unit-based Autoencoder is used to obtain the user's turn representation as well as context representation. A Parallel Double Q-learning algorithm with a Deep Neural Network (PD-DQN), combining two Double DQNs in parallel for the contextual and semantic information in the user's message, respectively, are proposed to determine the dialog act. Finally, the user's input and the determined dialog act are fed to an attention-based Transformer model to generate the response template. With the generated response template, the semantic slots are filled with their corresponding values to obtain the final sentence response. This article collects a multi-turn conversation database consisting of 4186 turns in the travel domain and 447 chitchat question-answer pairs as the evaluation corpus. Five-fold cross validation is employed for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed approach based on semantic dependency for intent detection increases the accuracy by 4.3%. For dialog policy decision, the PD-DQN achieves 87.57% task success rate, which is 13.9% higher than the baseline Double DQN (73.67%). Finally, using the attention-based Transformer for response template generation obtains a Bleu score of 13.6, improved by 1.5 compared to the Sequence-to-Sequence model. In subjective evaluation, both the dialog policy and sentence generation model achieve a higher appropriateness and grammatical correctness scores than the baseline system.},

abstract = {Contextual bandit algorithms are commonly used in recommender systems, where content popularity can change rapidly. These algorithms continuously learn latent mappings between users and items, based on contexts associated with them both. Recent recommendation algorithms that learn clustering or social structures between users have exhibited higher recommendation accuracy. However, as the number of users and items in the environment increases, the time required to generate recommendations deteriorates significantly. As a result, these cannot be deployed in practice. The state-of-the-art distributed bandit algorithm - DCCB - relies on a peer-to-peer network to share information among distributed workers. However, this approach does not scale well with the increasing number of users. Furthermore, it suffers from slow discovery of clusters, resulting in accuracy degradation.To address the above issues, this paper proposes a novel distributed bandit-based algorithm called DistCLUB. This algorithm lazily creates clusters in a distributed manner, and dramatically reduces the network data sharing requirement, achieving high scalability. Additionally, DistCLUB finds clusters much faster, achieving better accuracy than the state-of-the-art algorithm. Evaluation over both real-world benchmarks and synthetic datasets shows that DistCLUB is on average 8.87x faster than DCCB, and achieves 14.5% higher normalized prediction performance.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition systems traditionally require a manual annotation of massive training data, which is laborious and non-scalable. An alternative approach is mining existing online crowd-sourced repositories for open-ended, free annotated training data. However, differences across data sources or in observed contexts prevent a crowd-sourced based model reaching user-dependent recognition rates.To enhance the use of crowd-sourced data in activity recognition, we take an essential step forward by adapting a generic model based on crowd-sourced data to a personalized model. In this work, we investigate two adapting approaches: 1) a semi-supervised learning to combine crowd-sourced data and unlabeled user data, and 2) an active-learning to query the user for labeling samples where the crowd-sourced based model fails to recognize. We test our proposed approaches on 7 users using auditory modality on mobile phones with a total data of 14 days and up to 9 daily context classes. Experimental results indicate that the semi-supervised model can indeed improve the recognition accuracy up to 21% but is still significantly outperformed by a supervised model on user data. In the active learning scheme, the crowd-sourced model can reach the performance of the supervised model by requesting labels of 0.7% of user data only. Our work illustrates a promising first step towards an unobtrusive, efficient and open-ended context recognition system by adapting free online crowd-sourced data into a personalized model.},

abstract = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a challenging, multi-label classification problem as activities may co-occur and sensor signals corresponding to the same activity may vary in different contexts (e.g., different device placements). This paper proposes a Deep Heterogeneous Contrastive Hyper-Graph Learning (DHC-HGL) framework that captures heterogenous Context-Aware HAR (CA-HAR) hypergraph properties in a message-passing and neighborhood-aggregation fashion. Prior work only explored homogeneous or shallow-node-heterogeneous graphs. DHC-HGL handles heterogeneous CA-HAR data by innovatively 1) Constructing three different types of sub-hypergraphs that are each passed through different custom HyperGraph Convolution (HGC) layers designed to handle edge-heterogeneity and 2) Adopting a contrastive loss function to ensure node-heterogeneity. In rigorous evaluation on two CA-HAR datasets, DHC-HGL significantly outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by 5.8% to 16.7% on Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and 3.0% to 8.4% on Macro F1 scores. UMAP visualizations of learned CA-HAR node embeddings are also presented to enhance model explainability. Our code is publicly available1 to encourage further research.},

abstract = {Vector-borne diseases (VBDs), such as Dengue or Malaria, are one of the main concerns of public health agencies and governments. These diseases are mainly spread by mosquitoes acting as vectors by transmitting infected blood between humans. Machine learning can be used to design and improve control strategies of VBDs by providing models able to recognize disease vector mosquitoes and automatically capture or kill harmful species. The automatic identification of disease vector mosquitoes was not yet addressed concerning the hierarchical classification of data streams. Thus, reliable information has not been used to improve learning models, such as mosquitoes' hierarchical taxonomy. In this study, we propose a framework for the automatic identification of disease vector mosquitoes in the context of the hierarchical classification of data streams area. To this end, we propose a hierarchical adaptation of a disease vector mosquitoes' dataset to include their taxonomy and introduce kNC and Dribble, two novel classification methods fitted to hierarchical data streams representing the mosquitoes. Results depicted that our framework, using summarization techniques, achieves significantly better prediction and processing speed rates when compared to existing state-of-the-art models.},

abstract = {The Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) Challenge 2020 was an open competition of recognizing eight different activities that had been performed by three individual users and participants of this competition were tasked to classify these eight different activities with modes of locomotion and transportation. This year's data was recorded with a smartphone which was located in four different body positions. The primary challenge was to make a user-invariant as well as position-invariant classification model. The train set consisted of data from only user-1 with all positions whereas the test set consisted of data from user 2 and 3 with unspeicified sensor position. Moreover, a small validation with the same charecteristics of the test set was given to validate the classifier. In this paper, we have described our (Team Red Circle) approach in which we have used previous year's challenge data as well as this year's provided data to make our training dataset and validation set that have helped us to make our model generative. In our approach, we have extracted various types of features to make our model user independent and position invariant, we have applied Random Forest classifier which is a classical machine learning algorithm and achieved 92.69% accuracy on our customized train set and 77.04% accuracy on our customized validation set.},

abstract = {Many studies have developed Machine Learning (ML) approaches to detect Software Vulnerabilities (SVs) in functions and fine-grained code statements that cause such SVs. However, there is little work on leveraging such detection outputs for data-driven SV assessment to give information about exploitability, impact, and severity of SVs. The information is important to understand SVs and prioritize their fixing. Using large-scale data from 1,782 functions of 429 SVs in 200 real-world projects, we investigate ML models for automating function-level SV assessment tasks, i.e., predicting seven Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) metrics. We particularly study the value and use of vulnerable statements as inputs for developing the assessment models because SVs in functions are originated in these statements. We show that vulnerable statements are 5.8 times smaller in size, yet exhibit 7.5--114.5% stronger assessment performance (Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)) than non-vulnerable statements. Incorporating context of vulnerable statements further increases the performance by up to 8.9% (0.64 MCC and 0.75 F1-Score). Overall, we provide the initial yet promising ML-based baselines for function-level SV assessment, paving the way for further research in this direction.},

For task decoding, the classification methods Random Forest, LDA, and QDA were used; features were fixation- or saccade-related measures. Best accuracy for prediction of the three tasks Observe, Search, Track from the 4-minute gaze data samples was 83.7% (chance level 33%) using Random Forest. Best accuracy for prediction of all four tasks from the gaze data samples containing the first 30 seconds of viewing was 59.3% (chance level 25%) using LDA. Accuracy decreased significantly for task prediction on small gaze data chunks of 5 and 3 seconds, being 45.3% and 38.0% (chance 25%) for the four tasks, and 52.3% and 47.7% (chance 33%) for the three tasks.},

abstract = {Affective computing is a nascent field situated at the intersection of artificial intelligence with social and behavioral science. It studies how human emotions are perceived and expressed, which then informs the design of intelligent agents and systems that can either mimic this behavior to improve their intelligence or incorporate such knowledge to effectively understand and communicate with their human collaborators. Affective computing research has recently seen significant advances and is making a critical transformation from exploratory studies to real-world applications in the emerging research area known as applied affective computing.This book offers readers an overview of the state-of-the-art and emerging themes in affective computing, including a comprehensive review of the existing approaches to affective computing systems and social signal processing. It provides in-depth case studies of applied affective computing in various domains, such as social robotics and mental well-being. It also addresses ethical concerns related to affective computing and how to prevent misuse of the technology in research and applications. Further, this book identifies future directions for the field and summarizes a set of guidelines for developing next-generation affective computing systems that are effective, safe, and human-centered.For researchers and practitioners new to affective computing, this book will serve as an introduction to the field to help them in identifying new research topics or developing novel applications. For more experienced researchers and practitioners, the discussions in this book provide guidance for adopting a human-centered design and development approach to advance affective computing}

abstract = {Conventional multi-task model restricts the task structure to be linearly related, which may not be suitable when data is linearly nonseparable. To remedy this issue, we propose a kernel algorithm for online multi-task classification, as the large approximation space provided by reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces often contains an accurate function. Specifically, it maintains a local-global Gaussian distribution over each task model that guides the direction and scale of parameter updates. Nonetheless, optimizing over this space is computationally expensive. Moreover, most multi-task learning methods require accessing to the entire training instances, which is luxury unavailable in the large-scale streaming learning scenario. To overcome this issue, we propose a randomized kernel sampling technique across multiple tasks. Instead of requiring all inputs’ labels, the proposed algorithm determines whether to query a label or not via considering the confidence from the related tasks over label prediction. Theoretically, the algorithm trained on actively sampled labels can achieve a comparable result with one learned on all labels. Empirically, the proposed algorithm is able to achieve promising learning efficacy, while reducing the computational complexity and labeling cost simultaneously.},

abstract = {Biomedical event extraction is important for medical research and disease prevention, which has attracted much attention in recent years. Traditionally, most of the state-of-the-art systems have been based on shallow machine learning methods, which require many complex, hand-designed features. In addition, the words encoded by one-hot are unable to represent semantic information. Therefore, we utilize dependency-based embeddings to represent words semantically and syntactically. Then, we propose a parallel multi-pooling convolutional neural network (PMCNN) model to capture the compositional semantic features of sentences. Furthermore, we employ a rectified linear unit, which creates sparse representations with true zeros, and which is adapted to the biomedical event extraction, as a nonlinear function in PMCNN architecture.

abstract = {The automatic recognition of sound events by computers is an important aspect of emerging applications such as automated surveillance, machine hearing and auditory scene understanding. Recent advances in machine learning, as well as in computational models of the human auditory system, have contributed to advances in this increasingly popular research field. Robust sound event classification, the ability to recognise sounds under real-world noisy conditions, is an especially challenging task. Classification methods translated from the speech recognition domain, using features such as mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, have been shown to perform reasonably well for the sound event classification task, although spectrogram-based or auditory image analysis techniques reportedly achieve superior performance in noise. This paper outlines a sound event classification framework that compares auditory image front end features with spectrogram image-based front end features, using support vector machine and deep neural network classifiers. Performance is evaluated on a standard robust classification task in different levels of corrupting noise, and with several system enhancements, and shown to compare very well with current state-of-the-art classification techniques.},

The main advantage of the proposed method is its simplicity and computational efficiency. On benchmark datasets, our boosted products of decision stumps clearly outperform boosted trees, and on the MNIST dataset the algorithm achieves the second best result among no-domain-knowledge algorithms after deep belief nets. As a second contribution, we present an improved base learner for nominal features and show that boosting the product of two of these new subset indicator base learners solves the maximum margin matrix factorization problem used to formalize the collaborative filtering task. On a small benchmark dataset, we get experimental results comparable to the semi-definite-programming-based solution but at a much lower computational cost.},

These devices depend on managing application lifecycles to improve launch performance, but the management of application processes is not done in an efficient way. The standard low memory killer, that is responsible for freeing memory, does not consider any user information and it frequently kills applications that are going to be launched. Context-awareness presents several possibilities to make mobile systems more efficient and user-driven in terms of user experience. In this paper, we introduce a context-based launcher using recurrent neural network (RNN), a special branch of neural networks capable of remembering dependencies, taking in consideration not just previous inputs, but also previous outputs, providing high accuracy without any extra sensor context. Our system guarantees that most of the applications are ready to use in the background, substantially improving the launch time enabling a better user experience. Experimental results demonstrate that the novel scheme can reduce application launch latency in a significant manner.},

abstract = {The prevalence of online content has led to the widespread adoption of recommendation systems (RSs), which serve diverse purposes such as news, advertisements, and e-commerce recommendations. Despite their significance, data scarcity issues have significantly impaired the effectiveness of existing RS models and hindered their progress. To address this challenge, the concept of knowledge transfer, particularly from external sources like pre-trained language models, emerges as a potential solution to alleviate data scarcity and enhance RS development. However, the practice of knowledge transfer in RSs is intricate. Transferring knowledge between domains introduces data disparities, and the application of knowledge transfer in complex RS scenarios can yield negative consequences if not carefully designed. Therefore, this article contributes to this discourse by addressing the implications of data scarcity on RSs and introducing various strategies, such as data augmentation, self-supervised learning, transfer learning, broad learning, and knowledge graph utilization, to mitigate this challenge. Furthermore, it delves into the challenges and future direction within the RS domain, offering insights that are poised to facilitate the development and implementation of robust RSs, particularly when confronted with data scarcity.

abstract = {Context-aware1 systems have been employed to help users in their daily lives. In the recent years, researchers are exploring how context aware systems can benefit humanity through assisting patients, specifically those who suffer incurable diseases, to cope with their illness. In this paper, we direct our work to help people who suffer from COPD. Existing solutions have limits in terms of choosing relevant parameters and the accuracy of detecting exacerbations in the COPD. We propose HCES (Helper Context-aware Engine System) that aims to support chronic disease patients and doctors on any level of disease risk. To accomplish this system, HCES adopts ontology for representing and modeling context to well understand the scenario that we can use to monitor COPD's patients, uses an efficacy algorithm to select relevant attributes instead of a no cited one, predicts exacerbations with high accuracy by adding the discretization step, and arranges the pertinent attributes to use the most pertinent in an emergency case. These steps are beneficial in handling the uncertainty of context-aware systems. Furthermore, a comparison between algorithms for selecting attributes is done to choose the best one for COPD diseases. The main goal of this paper is to help medical personnel (patients, doctors or nurses) to take an efficient decision by identifying the most context-relevant attributes and predicting patient exacerbations.},

abstract = {Food image recognition is a challenging task that predicts the image’s food category or ingredient composition. It is an essential and fundamental step to realize automatic dietary recognition and assessment. Many food images, especially Chinese food, lack distinctive structured information and fixed semantic patterns. The current approaches have proposed to capture more discriminative features from local/attention-based perspectives to overcome this problem. However, ingredient composition is often overlooked, and it is worth noticing that the relation of food category and ingredient composition may also be conducive to image recognition. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Region-Level Attention Network (RLA-Net) for food and ingredient joint classification, which is composed of two stage modules. More specifically, in the Feature Extraction Stage, a two-branch structure is designed to extract global food features and local-region ingredient features under the supervision of the ground-truth label. In the Relation Fusion Stage, by utilizing the mutual relationship between the food category and ingredients, we propose a Region-Weighted Module (RWM) to obtain relation fusion features for better performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance in ingredient recognition on the Chinese Food dataset VIREO Food-172, and the results of food classification are also competitive.},

abstract = {Multi-task problems frequently arise in machine learning when there are multiple target variables, which share a common synergy while being sufficiently different that optimizing on any of the task does not necessarily imply an optimum for the others. In this work, we develop PEMBOT, a novel Pareto-based multi-task classification framework using a gradient boosted tree architecture. The proposed methodology involves a) generating multiple instances of Pareto optimal trees, b) diverse subset selection using a determinantal point process (DPP) model, and c) ensembling of diverse Pareto optimal trees to yield the final output. We tested our framework on a problem from an e-commerce domain wherein the task is to predict at order placement time the different adverse scenarios in the order shipment journey such as the package getting lost or damaged during shipment. This model enables us to take preemptive measures to prevent these scenarios from happening resulting in significant operational cost savings. Further, to show the generality of our approach, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a publicly available wine quality prediction dataset and compare against state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {Recommender systems personalize content by recommending items to users. Item recommendation algorithms are evaluated by metrics that compare the positions of truly relevant items among the recommended items. To speed up the computation of metrics, recent work often uses sampled metrics where only a smaller set of random items and the relevant items are ranked. This paper investigates such sampled metrics in more detail and shows that they are inconsistent with their exact counterpart, in the sense that they do not persist relative statements, for example, recommender A is better than B, not even in expectation. Moreover, the smaller the sample size, the less difference there is between metrics, and for very small sample size, all metrics collapse to the AUC metric. We show that it is possible to improve the quality of the sampled metrics by applying a correction, obtained by minimizing different criteria. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of the naive sampled metrics and their corrected variants. To summarize, our work suggests that sampling should be avoided for metric calculation, however if an experimental study needs to sample, the proposed corrections can improve the quality of the estimate.},

abstract = {The oboe is considered one of the most difficult woodwind instruments to learn due to the labor involved in mastering the embouchure required to produce a steady, long tone through the instrument’s reeds. Previous research in music education has suggested that using visualization or imagery as a training method, so-called audiation, helps novice learners gain a better understanding of the relationship between sound and embouchure. Inspired by this concept, we designed an interactive learning system using real-time acoustic analysis (MFCCs) and support vector machines (SVM). Our interactive visualization aims to support the user’s learning process by rendering the quality of good and bad sounds as pitch indications through particle swarm animations. A pilot user study showed that this makes the learning experience more reflective and self-directed, as the learner can understand the relationship between their breathing technique and the visualization of the generated sound quality. In this paper, we intend to address issues potentially involved in designing an intelligent learning system using sensing technologies in the context of music education.},

abstract = {Wearables are poised to transform health and wellness through automation of cost-effective, objective, and real-time health monitoring. However, machine learning models for these systems are designed based on labeled data collected, and feature representations engineered, in controlled environments. This approach has limited scalability of wearables because (i) collecting and labeling sufficiently large amounts of sensor data is a labor-intensive and expensive process; and (ii) wearables are deployed in highly dynamic environments of the end-users whose context undergoes consistent changes. We introduce TransNet, a deep learning framework that minimizes the costly process of data labeling, feature engineering, and algorithm retraining by constructing a scalable computational approach. TransNet learns general and reusable features in lower layers of the framework and quickly reconfigures the underlying models from a small number of labeled instances in a new domain, such as when the system is adopted by a new user or when a previously unseen event is to be added to event vocabulary of the system. Utilizing TransNet on four activity datasets, TransNet achieves an average accuracy of 88.1% in cross-subject learning scenarios using only one labeled instance for each activity class. This performance improves to an accuracy of 92.7% with five labeled instances.},

abstract = {The context of this study examines the requirements of Future Intelligent Networks (FIN), solutions, and current research directions through a survey technique. The background of this study is hinged on the applications of Machine Learning (ML) in the networking field. Through careful analysis of literature and real-world reports, we noted that ML has significantly expedited decision-making processes, enhanced intelligent automation, and helped resolve complex problems economically in different fields of life. Various researchers have also envisioned future networks incorporating intelligent functions and operations with ML. Several efforts have been made to automate individual functions and operations in the networking domain; however, most of the existing ML models proposed in the literature lack several vital requirements. Hence, this study aims to present a comprehensive summary of the requirements of FIN and propose a taxonomy of different network functionalities that needs to be equipped with ML techniques. The core objectives of this study are to provide a taxonomy of requirements envisioned for end-to-end FIN, relevant ML techniques, and their analysis to find research gaps, open issues, and future research directions. The real benefit of ML applications in any domain can only be ensured if intelligent capabilities cover all of its components. We observed that future generations of networks are heterogeneous, multi-vendor, and multidimensional, and ML can provide optimal results only if intelligent capabilities are used on a holistic scale. Realizing intelligence on a holistic scale is only possible if the ML algorithms can solve heterogeneous problems in a multi-vendor and multidimensional environment. ML models must be reliable and efficient, support, and possess the capability to learn and share the knowledge across the network layers and administrative domains to solve issues. First, this study ascertains the requirements of the FIN and proposes their taxonomy through reviews on envisioned ideas by various researchers and articles gathered from reputed conferences and standard developing organizations using keyword queries. Second, we have reviewed existing studies on ML applications focusing on coverage, heterogeneity, distributed architecture, and cross-domain knowledge learning and sharing. Our study observed that in the past, ML applications were focused mainly on an individual/isolated level only, and aspects of global and deep holistic learning with cross-layer/cross-domain knowledge sharing with agile ML operations are not explored at large. We recommend that the issues mentioned previously be addressed with improved ML architecture and agile operations and propose an ML pipeline based architecture for FIN. The significant contribution of this study is the impetus for researchers to seek ML models suitable for a modular, distributed, multi-domain, and multi-layer environment and provide decision making on a global or holistic rather than an individual function level.},

At a time when healthcare professionals are in short supply and the demand for low-cost treatments is ever-increasing, virtual health coaches (VHCs) offer intervention-on-demand for those limited by finances or geographic access to care. More recently, AI-powered virtual coaches have become a viable complement to human coaches. However, the push for AI-powered coaching systems raises several important issues for researchers, designers, clinicians, and patients. In this paper, we present a novel framework to guide the design and development of virtual coaching systems.

abstract = {Existing Bayesian models, especially nonparametric Bayesian methods, rely on specially conceived priors to incorporate domain knowledge for discovering improved latent representations. While priors affect posterior distributions through Bayes' rule, imposing posterior regularization is arguably more direct and in some cases more natural and general. In this paper, we present regularized Bayesian inference (RegBayes), a novel computational framework that performs posterior inference with a regularization term on the desired post-data posterior distribution under an information theoretical formulation. RegBayes is more flexible than the procedure that elicits expert knowledge via priors, and it covers both directed Bayesian networks and undirected Markov networks. When the regularization is induced from a linear operator on the posterior distributions, such as the expectation operator, we present a general convex-analysis theorem to characterize the solution of RegBayes. Furthermore, we present two concrete examples of RegBayes, infinite latent support vector machines (iLSVM) and multi-task infinite latent support vector machines (MT-iLSVM), which explore the large-margin idea in combination with a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features for classification and multi-task learning, respectively. We present efficient inference methods and report empirical studies on several benchmark data sets, which appear to demonstrate the merits inherited from both large-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics. Such results contribute to push forward the interface between these two important subfields, which have been largely treated as isolated in the community.},

abstract = {The task and worker recommendation problems in crowdsourcing systems have brought up unique characteristics that are not present in traditional recommendation scenarios, i.e., the huge flow of tasks with short lifespans, the importance of workers’ capabilities, and the quality of the completed tasks. These unique features make traditional recommendation approaches no longer satisfactory for task and worker recommendation in crowdsourcing systems. In this article, we propose a two-tier data representation scheme (defining a worker--category suitability score and a worker--task attractiveness score) to support personalized task and worker recommendations. We also extend two optimization methods, namely least mean square error and Bayesian personalized rank, to better fit the characteristics of task/worker recommendation in crowdsourcing systems. We then integrate the proposed representation scheme and the extended optimization methods along with the two adapted popular learning models, i.e., matrix factorization and kNN, and result in two lines of top-N recommendation algorithms for crowdsourcing systems: (1) Top-N-Tasks recommendation algorithms for discovering the top-N most suitable tasks for a given worker and (2) Top-N-Workers recommendation algorithms for identifying the top-N best workers for a task requester. An extensive experimental study is conducted that validates the effectiveness and efficiency of a broad spectrum of algorithms, accompanied by our analysis and the insights gained.},

abstract = {Self-adaptive systems (SASs) are designed to handle changes and uncertainties through a feedback loop with four core functionalities: monitoring, analyzing, planning, and execution. Recently, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), especially the area of large language models, has shown impressive performance in data comprehension and logical reasoning. These capabilities are highly aligned with the functionalities required in SASs, suggesting a strong potential to employ GenAI to enhance SASs. However, the specific benefits and challenges of employing GenAI in SASs remain unclear. Yet, providing a comprehensive understanding of these benefits and challenges is complex due to several reasons: limited publications in the SAS field, the technological and application diversity within SASs, and the rapid evolution of GenAI technologies. To that end, this article aims to provide researchers and practitioners a comprehensive snapshot that outlines the potential benefits and challenges of employing GenAI’s within SAS. Specifically, we gather, filter, and analyze literature from four distinct research fields and organize them into two main categories to potential benefits: (i) enhancements to the autonomy of SASs centered around the specific functions of the MAPE-K feedback loop, and (ii) improvements in the interaction between humans and SASs within human-on-the-loop settings. From our study, we outline a research roadmap that highlights the challenges of integrating GenAI into SASs. The roadmap starts with outlining key research challenges that need to be tackled to exploit the potential for applying GenAI in the field of SAS. The roadmap concludes with a practical reflection, elaborating on current shortcomings of GenAI and proposing possible mitigation strategies.†},

abstract = {The recent prevalence of publicly accessible, large medical imaging datasets has led to a proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) models for cardiovascular image classification and analysis. At the same time, the potentially significant impacts of these models have motivated the development of a range of explainable AI (XAI) methods that aim to explain model predictions given certain image inputs. However, many of these methods are not developed or evaluated with domain experts, and explanations are not contextualized in terms of medical expertise or domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel framework and python library, MiMICRI, that provides domain-centered counterfactual explanations of cardiovascular image classification models. MiMICRI helps users interactively select and replace segments of medical images that correspond to morphological structures. From the counterfactuals generated, users can then assess the influence of each segment on model predictions, and validate the model against known medical facts. We evaluate this library with two medical experts. Our evaluation demonstrates that a domain-centered XAI approach can enhance the interpretability of model explanations, and help experts reason about models in terms of relevant domain knowledge. However, concerns were also surfaced about the clinical plausibility of the counterfactuals generated. We conclude with a discussion on the generalizability and trustworthiness of the MiMICRI framework, as well as the implications of our findings on the development of domain-centered XAI methods for model interpretability in healthcare contexts.},

abstract = {Facilitated by large language models (LLMs), personalized text generation has become a rapidly growing research direction. Most existing studies focus on designing specialized models for a particular domain, or they require fine-tuning the LLMs to generate personalized text. We consider a typical scenario in which the large language model, which generates personalized output, is frozen and can only be accessed through APIs. Under this constraint, all one can do is to improve the input text (i.e., text prompts) sent to the LLM, a procedure that is usually done manually. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically revise prompts for personalized text generation. The proposed method takes the initial prompts generated by a state-of-the-art, multistage framework for personalized generation and rewrites a few critical components that summarize and synthesize the personal context. The prompt rewriter employs a training paradigm that chains together supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL), where SL reduces the search space of RL and RL facilitates end-to-end training of the rewriter. Using datasets from three representative domains, we demonstrate that the rewritten prompts outperform both the original prompts and the prompts optimized via supervised learning or reinforcement learning alone. In-depth analysis of the rewritten prompts shows that they are not only human readable, but also able to guide manual revision of prompts when there is limited resource to employ reinforcement learning to train the prompt rewriter, or when it is costly to deploy an automatic prompt rewriter for inference.},

abstract = {The emerging 5G services offer numerous new opportunities for networked applications. In this study, we seek to answer two key questions: i) is the throughput of mmWave 5G predictable, and ii) can we build "good" machine learning models for 5G throughput prediction? To this end, we conduct a measurement study of commercial mmWave 5G services in a major U.S. city, focusing on the throughput as perceived by applications running on user equipment (UE). Through extensive experiments and statistical analysis, we identify key UE-side factors that affect 5G performance and quantify to what extent the 5G throughput can be predicted. We then propose Lumos5G -- a composable machine learning (ML) framework that judiciously considers features and their combinations, and apply state-of-the-art ML techniques for making context-aware 5G throughput predictions. We demonstrate that our framework is able to achieve 1.37X to 4.84X reduction in prediction error compared to existing models. Our work can be viewed as a feasibility study for building what we envisage as a dynamic 5G throughput map (akin to Google traffic map). We believe this approach provides opportunities and challenges in building future 5G-aware apps.},

abstract = {Predictive algorithms are a critical part of the ubiquitous computing vision, enabling appropriate action on behalf of users. A common class of algorithms, which has seen uptake in ubiquitous computing, is supervised machine learning algorithms. Such algorithms are trained to make predictions based on a set of features (selected at training time). However, features needed at prediction time (such as mobile information that impacts battery life, or information collected from users via experience sampling) may be costly to collect. In addition, both cost and value of a feature may change dynamically based on real-world context (such as battery life or user location) and prediction context (what features are already known, and what their values are). We contribute a framework for dynamically trading off feature cost against prediction quality at prediction time. We demonstrate this work in the context of three prediction tasks: providing prospective tenants estimates for energy costs in potential homes, estimating momentary stress levels from both sensed and user-provided mobile data, and classifying images to facilitate opportunistic device interactions. Our results show that while our approach to cost-sensitive feature selection is up to 45% less costly than competing approaches, error rates are equivalent or better.},

Good experimentation requires creativity, is based on prior results and informed from the literature. However, finding relevant information from online sources to guide experimentation causes inefficiencies for data scientists. The objective of this research is to help data scientists through the presentation of context aware ranked data science experiments, considering problem domain, development task and learning task. Data science experiments for this study were extracted from publicly available interactive notebooks and were manually annotated based on a taxonomy of data science techniques and a meta model of a data science experiment. Further, the ranking algorithm was developed for data science experiments for given problem domain and development task. As a result, a tool was developed to demonstrate context aware ranked data science experiments for given problem domains such as natural language processing, computer vision and time series and for development stages such as feature engineering and model selection. This study shows that tools and techniques can be designed to be aware of the data science context, in fact, much more so than for software engineering tools. This study supports these efforts by providing knowledge that can improve experimentation process of data scientists.},

We argue that forms should be adapted to the user and their context in a controllable way, to minimize the potential negative effects of any adaptation. This can be accomplished with Scaler, a novel web environment for designing and deploying forms in which adaptation is initiated by the system and/or the user according to a vector profile, but always under the user’s control, using two unsupervised learning methods: (1) A scoring function that ranks the most usable widgets for each data item on the form, balancing the input and preferences of the stakeholders involved in the form (i.e., user, designer, and developer). (2) A widget recommendation that contrasts the user’s profile and those of all other users who have used the same form, whether they have modified it before or not. Our experiment with a car booking form shows that, after some interaction sessions (from 1 to 50 depending on the form field) and some user-controlled adaptations (from 3 to 29 depending on the field), the form design converged to a stabilized selection.},

For this purpose, we collected touch interaction patterns of children solving math tasks on a multi-touch device. 30 fourth-grade students from a primary school participated in the study. Based on these data, we investigate how machine learning methods can be applied to predict cognitive workload associated with tasks of varying difficulty. Our results show that interaction patterns from a touchscreen can be used to significantly improve automatic prediction of high levels of cognitive workload (average classification accuracy of 90.67% between the easiest and most difficult tasks). Analyzing an extensive set of features, we discuss which characteristics are most likely to be of high value for future implementations. We furthermore elaborate on design choices made for the used multiple choice interface and discuss critical factors that should be considered for future touch-based learning interfaces.},

abstract = {Finding multiple temporal relationships among locations can benefit a bunch of urban applications, such as dynamic offline advertising and smart public transport planning. While some efforts have been made on finding static relationships among locations, little attention is focused on studying time-aware location relationships. Indeed, abundant location-based human activities are time-varying and the availability of these data enables a new paradigm for understanding the dynamic relationships in a period among connective locations. To this end, we propose to study a new problem, namely multi-Temporal relationship inference among locations (Trial for short), where the major challenge is how to integrate dynamic and geographical influence under the relationship sparsity constraint. Specifically, we propose a solution to Trial with a graph learning scheme, which includes a spatially evolving graph neural network (SEENet) with two collaborative components: spatially evolving graph convolution module (SEConv) and spatially evolving self-supervised learning strategy (SE-SSL). SEConv performs the intra-time aggregation and inter-time propagation to capture the multifaceted spatially evolving contexts from the view of location message passing. In addition, SE-SSL designs time-aware self-supervised learning tasks in a global-local manner with additional evolving constraint to enhance the location representation learning and further handle the relationship sparsity. Finally, experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over several state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {In the last decade, deep learning and word embeddings have made significant impacts on information retrieval (IR) by adding techniques based in neural networks and language models. At the same time, certain search modalities such as neural IR and conversational search have become more popular. This book, written by international academic and industry experts, brings the field up to date with detailed discussions of these new approaches and techniques. The book is organized in three sections: Foundations, Adaptations and Concerns, and Verticals.Under Foundations, we address topics that form the basic structure of any modern IR system, including recommender systems. These new techniques are developed to augment indexing, retrieval, and ranking. Neural IR, recommender systems, evaluation, query-driven functionality, and knowledge graphs are covered in this section.IR systems need to adapt to specific user characteristics and preferences, and techniques that were considered too niche a few years ago are now a matter of system design consideration. The Adaptations and Concerns section covers the following topics: conversational search, cross-language retrieval, temporal extraction and retrieval, bias in retrieval systems, and privacy in search.While web search engines are the most popular information access point, there are cases where specific verticals provide a better experience in terms of content and relevance. The Verticals section describes eCommerce, professional search, personal collections, music retrieval, and biomedicine as examples.}

abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are an emerging technology with many potential applications. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can provide a convenient and unobtrusive real time input for BCI. fNIRS is especially promising as a signal that could be used to automatically classify a user’s current cognitive workload. However, the data needed to train such a classifier is currently not widely available, difficult to collect, and difficult to interpret due to noise and cross-subject variation. A further challenge is the need for significant user-specific calibration. To address these issues, we introduce a new dataset gathered from 15 subjects and a new multi-stage supervised machine learning pipeline. Our approach learns from both observed data and augmented data derived from multiple subjects in its early stages, and then fine-tunes predictions to an individual subject in its last stage. We show promising gains in accuracy in a standard “n-back” cognitive workload classification task compared to baselines that use only subject-specific data or only group-level data, even when our approach is given much less subject-specific data. Even though these experiments analyzed the data retrospectively, we carefully removed anything from our process that could not have been done in real time, because our process is targeted at future real-time operation. This paper contributes a new dataset, a new multi-stage training pipeline, results showing significant improvement compared to alternative pipelines, and discussion of the implications for user interface design. Our complete dataset and software are publicly available at https://tufts-hci-lab.github.io/code_and_datasets/. We hope these results make fNIRS-based interactive brain input easier for a wide range of future researchers and designers to explore.},

(i.e., the original study) used fMRI to classify the type of comprehension tasks performed by developers and relate their results to their expertise. We replicate the original study using lightweight biometrics sensors. Our study participants---28 undergrads in computer science---performed comprehension tasks on source code and natural language prose. We developed machine learning models to automatically identify what kind of tasks developers are working on leveraging their brain-, heart-, and skin-related signals. The best improvement over the original study performance is achieved using solely the heart signal obtained through a single device (BAC 87% vs. 79.1%). Differently from the original study, we did not observe a correlation between the participants' expertise and the classifier performance (τ = 0.16, p = 0.31). Our findings show that lightweight biometric sensors can be used to accurately recognize comprehension tasks opening interesting scenarios for research and practice.},

abstract = {Recent advances in communication technologies and the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IOMT) have transformed smart healthcare enabled by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may be infeasible in realistic healthcare scenarios due to the high scalability of modern healthcare networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL), as an emerging distributed collaborative AI paradigm, is particularly attractive for smart healthcare, by coordinating multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) to perform AI training without sharing raw data. Accordingly, we provide a comprehensive survey on the use of FL in smart healthcare. First, we present the recent advances in FL, the motivations, and the requirements of using FL in smart healthcare. The recent FL designs for smart healthcare are then discussed, ranging from resource-aware FL, secure and privacy-aware FL to incentive FL and personalized FL. Subsequently, we provide a state-of-the-art review on the emerging applications of FL in key healthcare domains, including health data management, remote health monitoring, medical imaging, and COVID-19 detection. Several recent FL-based smart healthcare projects are analyzed, and the key lessons learned from the survey are also highlighted. Finally, we discuss interesting research challenges and possible directions for future FL research in smart healthcare.},

abstract = {Stance detection is the task of automatically determining whether the author of a piece of text is in favor of, against, or neutral towards a target such as a topic, entity, or claim. In this paper, we propose a method based on RoBERTa to classify stances by capturing the context of the discussion through the examination of pairs of stances and relational structures of debates specific to each topic within the defined window of each forum participant's interventions. Furthermore, we examine the degree of disagreement and neutrality in various debate topics to measure divergence of opinion in the course of the debate and estimate the emotional state manifested in different debate topics. We conduct extensive experiments using two publicly available datasets and demonstrate that our method considers more stance classes, provides better results and yields statistical improvements over existing techniques. Our quantitative analysis of model performance yields F-1 scores of over 0.745. Interestingly, we obtained the highest F-1 score, 0.814, on a stance class which was not taken into consideration in prior work. We report that none of the metrics utilized to measure divergence of opinion yield values exceeding 50% and the correlations between the same topics over 10-fold cross-validation are statistically significant for the majority of them (p &lt; 0.005). Several future research avenues are proposed.},

We show that BayesPA subsumes the standard online Passive-Aggressive (PA) learning and extends naturally to incorporate latent variables for both parametric and nonparametric Bayesian inference, therefore providing great flexibility for explorative analysis. As an important example, we apply BayesPA to topic modeling and derive efficient online learning algorithms for max-margin topic models. We further develop nonparametric BayesPA topic models to infer the unknown number of topics in an online manner. Experimental results on 20newsgroups and a large Wikipedia multi-label dataset (with 1.1 millions of training documents and 0.9 million of unique terms in the vocabulary) show that our approaches significantly improve time efficiency while achieving comparable accuracy with the corresponding batch algorithms.},

abstract = {Sleep constitutes a big portion of our lives and is a major part of health and well-being. The vital repair and regeneration tasks carried out during sleep are essential for our physical, mental and emotional health. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder that is characterized by repeated pauses in breathing during sleep. These pauses, or apneas, deplete the brain and the rest of the body of oxygen and disrupt the normal sleep cycle. OSA is associated with a number of adverse safety and health consequences, including excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, which increase the risk for motor vehicle and work-related accidents. OSA also results in an increased risk for hypertension, cardiovascular disease, the development of diabetes and even premature death. The gold standard method for diagnosing OSA patients is polysomnography (PSG). PSG is an overnight sleep test that monitors a participant's biophysical changes (EEG, ECG, etc.) that occur during sleep. Despite its wide use and multi-parametric nature, there are multiple complications associated with that test that make it ineffective as an early-stage diagnosis tool. In this paper, we propose a daytime OSA screening tool that addresses the shortcomings of PSG. The framework consists of a data collection component that acquires information about the subject being tested, and a prediction component that analyzes the collected data and makes a diagnosis.We identify patients' key physiological, psychological and contextual features and apply advanced machine learning algorithms to build effective prediction models that help identify OSA patients in the comfort of their own home. The system was deployed in a pilot sleep apnea study of 16 patients. Results demonstrate the proposed system's great potential in helping sleep specialists in the initial assessment of patients with suspected OSA.},

abstract = {In traditional machine learning, classifiers training is typically undertaken in the setting of single-task learning, so the trained classifier can discriminate between different classes. However, this must be based on the assumption that different classes are mutually exclusive. In real applications, the above assumption does not always hold. For example, the same book may belong to multiple subjects. From this point of view, researchers were motivated to formulate multi-label learning problems. In this context, each instance can be assigned multiple labels but the classifiers training is still typically undertaken in the setting of single-task learning. When probabilistic approaches are adopted for classifiers training, multi-task learning can be enabled through transformation of a multi-labelled data set into several binary data sets. The above data transformation could usually result in the class imbalance issue. Without the above data transformation, multi-labelling of data results in an exponential increase of the number of classes, leading to fewer instances for each class and a higher difficulty for identifying each class. In addition, multi-labelling of data is very time consuming and expensive in some application areas, such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we introduce a novel formulation of the hate speech type identification problem in the setting of multi-task learning through our proposed fuzzy ensemble approach. In this setting, single-labelled data can be used for semi-supervised multi-label learning and two new metrics (detection rate and irrelevance rate) are thus proposed to measure more effectively the performance for this kind of learning tasks. We report an experimental study on identification of four types of hate speech, namely: religion, race, disability and sexual orientation. The experimental results show that our proposed fuzzy ensemble approach outperforms other popular probabilistic approaches, with an overall detection rate of 0.93.},

We find decision tree achieves the best performance among four commonly used static classifiers, while vertical and horizonal features have better recognition accuracy than magnitude features. Furthermore, a well-pruned decision tree with simple time domain features and less over-fitting on the training data can provide a usable model for inferencing a physical activity diary, refined by a similarity match from K-means clustering results and smoothed by an HMM-based Viterbi algorithm.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning serves as a potent tool for modeling dynamic user interests within recommender systems, garnering increasing research attention of late. However, a significant drawback persists: its poor data efficiency, stemming from its interactive nature. The training of reinforcement learning-based recommender systems demands expensive online interactions to amass adequate trajectories, essential for agents to learn user preferences. This inefficiency renders reinforcement learning-based recommender systems a formidable undertaking, necessitating the exploration of potential solutions. Recent strides in offline reinforcement learning present a new perspective. Offline reinforcement learning empowers agents to glean insights from offline datasets and deploy learned policies in online settings. Given that recommender systems possess extensive offline datasets, the framework of offline reinforcement learning aligns seamlessly. Despite being a burgeoning field, works centered on recommender systems utilizing offline reinforcement learning remain limited. This survey aims to introduce and delve into offline reinforcement learning within recommender systems, offering an inclusive review of existing literature in this domain. Furthermore, we strive to underscore prevalent challenges, opportunities, and future pathways, poised to propel research in this evolving field.},

Hence, they could benefit from a virtual coach that provides personalized feedback about the execution of their training exercises. As a first step towards this goal, we developed an algorithm to detect and classify goalkeeper training exercises using a wearable inertial sensor attached to a goalkeeper glove. We collected data from 14 goalkeeper trainees while performing a series of training exercises (e.g., dives, catches, throws). Our approach first detects the exercises using an event detection algorithm based on a high-pass filter, a peak detector, and Dynamic Time Warping to detect and eliminate irrelevant motion instances. Then, it extracts a set of statistical and heuristic features to describe the different exercises and train a machine learning classifier. Our exercise detection approach retrieves 93.8% of the relevant exercises with 90.6% precision and classifies the detected exercises with an accuracy of 96.5%. The exercises recognized by our algorithm can be used to compute further qualitative metrics about individual exercise executions to provide goalkeepers with relevant feedback about their training.},

We conducted an 8-week field experiment (N=71) to evaluate the effectiveness of both the adaptation and explanation aspects of Time2Stop. Our results indicate that our adaptive models significantly outperform the baseline methods on intervention accuracy (&gt;32.8% relatively) and receptivity (&gt;8.0%). In addition, incorporating explanations further enhances the effectiveness by 53.8% and 11.4% on accuracy and receptivity, respectively. Moreover, Time2Stop significantly reduces overuse, decreasing app visit frequency by 7.0 ∼ 8.9%. Our subjective data also echoed these quantitative measures. Participants preferred the adaptive interventions and rated the system highly on intervention time accuracy, effectiveness, and level of trust.

To purchase a bottle of water for instance, a user must locate an e-commerce app, type the keyword for a search, select the right item from the list, and finally place an order. This process could be greatly simplified if the smartphone identifies the object of interest and automatically executes the user preferred actions for the object. We present Knocker that identifies the object when a user simply knocks on an object with a smartphone. The basic principle of Knocker is leveraging a unique set of responses generated from the knock. Knocker takes a multimodal sensing approach that utilizes microphones, accelerometers, and gyroscopes to capture the knock responses, and exploits machine learning to accurately identify objects. We also present 15 applications enabled by Knocker that showcase the novel interaction method between users and objects. Knocker uses only the built-in smartphone sensors and thus is fully deployable without specialized hardware or tags on either the objects or the smartphone. Our experiments with 23 objects show that Knocker achieves an accuracy of 98% in a controlled lab and 83% in the wild.},

abstract = {During the onset of a natural or man-made crisis event, public often share relevant information for emergency services on social web platforms such as Twitter. However, filtering such relevant data in real-time at scale using social media mining is challenging due to the short noisy text, sparse availability of relevant data, and also, practical limitations in collecting large labeled data during an ongoing event. In this paper, we hypothesize that unsupervised domain adaptation through multi-task learning can be a useful framework to leverage data from past crisis events for training efficient information filtering models during the sudden onset of a new crisis. We present a novel method to classify relevant social posts during an ongoing crisis without seeing any new data from this event (fully unsupervised domain adaptation). Specifically, we construct a customized multi-task architecture with a multi-domain discriminator for crisis analytics: multi-task domain adversarial attention network (MT-DAAN). This model consists of dedicated attention layers for each task to provide model interpretability; critical for real-word applications. As deep networks struggle with sparse datasets, we show that this can be improved by sharing a base layer for multitask learning and domain adversarial training. The framework is validated with the public datasets of TREC incident streams that provide labeled Twitter posts (tweets) with relevant classes (Priority, Factoid, Sentiment) across 10 different crisis events such as floods and earthquakes. Evaluation of domain adaptation for crisis events is performed by choosing one target event as the test set and training on the rest. Our results show that the multi-task model outperformed its single-task counterpart. For the qualitative evaluation of interpretability, we show that the attention layer can be used as a guide to explain the model predictions and empower emergency services for exploring accountability of the model, by showcasing the words in a tweet that are deemed important in the classification process. Finally, we show a practical implication of our work by providing a use-case for the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {Estimation of Markov Random Field and covariance models from high-dimensional data represents a canonical problem that has received a lot of attention in the literature. A key assumption, widely employed, is that of sparsity of the underlying model. In this paper, we study the problem of estimating such models exhibiting a more intricate structure comprising simultaneously of sparse, structured sparse and dense components. Such structures naturally arise in several scientific fields, including molecular biology, finance and political science. We introduce a general framework based on a novel structured norm that enables us to estimate such complex structures from high-dimensional data. The resulting optimization problem is convex and we introduce a linearized multi-block alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to solve it efficiently. We illustrate the superior performance of the proposed framework on a number of synthetic data sets generated from both random and structured networks. Further, we apply the method to a number of real data sets and discuss the results.},

abstract = {Default user detection plays one of the backbones in credit risk forecasting and management. It aims at, given a set of corresponding features, e.g., patterns extracted from trading behaviors, predicting the polarity indicating whether a user will fail to make required payments in the future. Recent efforts attempted to incorporate attributed heterogeneous information network&nbsp;(AHIN) for extracting complex interactive features of users and achieved remarkable success on discovering specific default users such as fraud, cash-out users, etc. In this paper, we consider default users, a more general concept in credit risk, and propose a multi-view attributed heterogeneous information network based approach coined MAHINDER to remedy the special challenges. First, multiple views of user behaviors are adopted to learn personal profile due to the endogenous aspect of financial default. Second, local behavioral patterns are specifically modeled since financial default is adversarial and accumulated. With the real datasets contained 1.38 million users on Alibaba platform, we investigate the effectiveness of MAHINDER, and the experimental results exhibit the proposed approach is able to improve AUC over 2.8% and Recall@Precision=0.1 over 13.1% compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Meanwhile, MAHINDER has as good interpretability as tree-based methods like GBDT, which buoys the deployment in online platforms.},

In this paper, we describe an experiment we con-ducted to explore some of the issues around using an elec-troencephalograph (EEG) for classifying working memory load. Within this experiment, we present our classification methodology, including a novel feature selection scheme that seems to alleviate the need for complex drift modeling and artifact rejection. We demonstrate classification accuracies of up to 99% for 2 memory load levels and up to 88% for 4 levels. We also present results suggesting that we can do this with shorter windows, much less training data, and a smaller number of EEG channels, than reported previously. Finally, we show results suggesting that the models we construct transfer across variants of the task, implying some level of generality. We believe these findings extend prior work and bring us a step closer to the use of such technologies in HCI research.},

abstract = {&lt;italic&gt;Motivation:&lt;/italic&gt; To minimize the accelerating amount of time invested on the biomedical literature search, numerous approaches for automated knowledge extraction have been proposed. Relation extraction is one such task where semantic relations between the entities are identified from the free text. In the biomedical domain, extraction of regulatory pathways, metabolic processes, adverse drug reaction or disease models necessitates knowledge from the individual relations, for example, physical or regulatory interactions between genes, proteins, drugs, chemical, disease or phenotype. &lt;italic&gt;Results:&lt;/italic&gt; In this paper, we study the relation extraction task from three major biomedical and clinical tasks, namely drug-drug interaction, protein-protein interaction, and medical concept relation extraction. Towards this, we model the relation extraction problem in a multi-task learning (MTL)framework, and introduce for the first time the concept of structured self-attentive network complemented with the adversarial learning approach for the prediction of relationships from the biomedical and clinical text. The fundamental notion of MTL is to simultaneously learn multiple problems together by utilizing the concepts of the shared representation. Additionally, we also generate the highly efficient single task model which exploits the shortest dependency path embedding learned over the attentive gated recurrent unit to compare our proposed MTL models. The framework we propose significantly improves over all the baselines (deep learning techniques)and single-task models for predicting the relationships, without compromising on the performance of all the tasks.},

abstract = {The last decade has witnessed many successes of deep learning-based models for industry-scale recommender systems. These models are typically trained offline in a batch manner. While being effective in capturing users’ past interactions with recommendation platforms, batch learning suffers from long model-update latency and is vulnerable to system biases, making it hard to adapt to distribution shift and explore new items or user interests. Although online learning-based approaches (e.g., multi-armed bandits) have demonstrated promising theoretical results in tackling these challenges, their practical real-time implementation in large-scale recommender systems remains limited. First, the scalability of online approaches in servicing a massive online traffic while ensuring timely updates of bandit parameters poses a significant challenge. Additionally, exploring uncertainty in recommender systems can easily result in unfavorable user experience, highlighting the need for devising intricate strategies that effectively balance the trade-off between exploitation and exploration. In this paper, we introduce Online Matching: a scalable closed-loop bandit system learning from users’ direct feedback on items in real time. We present a hybrid offline + online approach for constructing this system, accompanied by a comprehensive exposition of the end-to-end system architecture. We propose Diag-LinUCB – a novel extension of the LinUCB algorithm – to enable distributed updates of bandits parameter in a scalable and timely manner. We conduct live experiments in YouTube and show that Online Matching is able to enhance the capabilities of fresh content discovery and item exploration in the present platform.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at tackling various natural language tasks. However, due to the significant costs involved in re-training or fine-tuning them, they remain largely static and difficult to personalize. Nevertheless, a variety of applications could benefit from generations that are tailored to users' preferences, goals, and knowledge. Among them is web search, where knowing what a user is trying to accomplish, what they care about, and what they know can lead to improved search experiences. In this work, we propose a novel and general approach that augments an LLM with relevant context from users' interaction histories with a search engine in order to personalize its outputs. Specifically, we construct an entity-centric knowledge store for each user based on their search and browsing activities on the web, which is then leveraged to provide contextually relevant LLM prompt augmentations. This knowledge store is light-weight, since it only produces user-specific aggregate projections of interests and knowledge onto public knowledge graphs, and leverages existing search log infrastructure, thereby mitigating the privacy, compliance, and scalability concerns associated with building deep user profiles for personalization. We validate our approach on the task of contextual query suggestion, which requires understanding not only the user's current search context but also what they historically know and care about. Through a number of experiments based on human evaluation, we show that our approach is significantly better than several other LLM-powered baselines, generating query suggestions that are contextually more relevant, personalized, and useful.},

Through analysing state-of-the-art research on mobile Notification Management Systems, it was identified that few open-source notification data sets and, corresponding benchmarks, have been created and the majority of NMSs apply supervised learning methods. This paper investigates the use of a, freely shareable, synthetic mobile notification data set for developing and evaluating NMS performance using Reinforcement Learning. A Q-learning and Deep Q-learning agent were trained using synthetic data and an OpenAI Gym environment was created for evaluation. Final results illustrated that the Q-learning and Deep Q-learning agents could predict a users action toward notifications with ≈80% success when trained and evaluated upon real or synthetic data and ≈65% success when trained on synthetic and evaluated upon real notification data.},

abstract = {Mobile advertising has undoubtedly become one of the fastest-growing industries in the world. The influx of capital attracts increasing fraudsters to defraud money from advertisers. Fraudsters can leverage many techniques, where bots install fraud is the most difficult to detect due to its ability to emulate normal users by implementing sophisticated behavioral patterns to evade from detection rules defined by human experts. Therefore, we proposed BotSpot1 for bots install fraud detection previously. However, there are some drawbacks in BotSpot, such as the sparsity of the devices’ neighbors, weak interactive information of leaf nodes, and noisy labels. In this work, we propose BotSpot++ to improve these drawbacks: (1) for the sparsity of the devices’ neighbors, we propose to construct a super device node to enrich the graph structure and information flow utilizing domain knowledge and a clustering algorithm; (2) for the weak interactive information, we propose to incorporate a self-attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of various leaf nodes; and (3) for the noisy labels, we apply a label smoothing mechanism to alleviate it. Comprehensive experimental results show that BotSpot++ yields the best performance compared with six state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we deploy our model to the advertising platform of Mobvista,2 a leading global mobile advertising company. The online experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

abstract = {Search result diversification is a natural approach for tackling ambiguous queries. Nevertheless, not all queries are equally ambiguous, and hence different queries could benefit from different diversification strategies. A more lenient or more aggressive diversification strategy is typically encoded by existing approaches as a trade-off between promoting relevance or diversity in the search results. In this paper, we propose to learn such a trade-off on a per-query basis. In particular, we examine how the need for diversification can be learnt for each query - given a diversification approach and an unseen query, we predict an effective trade-off between relevance and diversity based on similar previously seen queries. Thorough experiments using the TREC ClueWeb09 collection show that our selective approach can significantly outperform a uniform diversification for both classical and state-of-the-art diversification approaches.},

abstract = {Non-functional properties (NFPs) such as latency, memory requirements, or hardware cost are an important characteristic of AI software systems, especially in the domain of resource-constrained embedded devices. Embedded AI products require sufficient resources for satisfactory latency and accuracy, but should also be cost-efficient and therefore not use more powerful hardware than strictly necessary. Traditionally, modeling and optimization efforts focus on the AI architecture, utilizing methods such as neural architecture search (NAS). However, before developers can start optimizing, they need to know which architectures are suitable candidates for their use case. To this end, architectures must be viewed in context: model post-processing (e.g. quantization), hardware platform, and run-time configuration such as batching all have significant effects on NFPs and therefore on AI architecture performance. Moreover, scalar parameters such as batch size cannot be benchmarked exhaustively. We argue that it is worthwhile to address this issue by means of black-box models before deciding on AI architectures for optimization and hardware/software platforms for inference. To support our claim, we present an AI product line with variable hardware and software components, perform benchmarks, and present notable results. Additionally, we evaluate both compactness and generalization capabilities of regression tree-based modeling approaches from the machine learning and product line engineering communities. We find that linear model trees perform best: they can capture NFPs of known AI configurations with a mean error of up to 13 %, and can predict unseen configurations with a mean error of 10 to 26 %. We find linear model trees to be more compact and interpretable than other tree-based approaches.},

abstract = {Video sharing platforms like YouTube are increasingly targeted by aggression and hate attacks. Prior work has shown how these attacks often take place as a result of "raids," i.e., organized efforts by ad-hoc mobs coordinating from third-party communities. Despite the increasing relevance of this phenomenon, however, online services often lack effective countermeasures to mitigate it. Unlike well-studied problems like spam and phishing, coordinated aggressive behavior both targets and is perpetrated by humans, making defense mechanisms that look for automated activity unsuitable. Therefore, the de-facto solution is to reactively rely on user reports and human moderation. In this paper, we propose an automated solution to identify YouTube videos that are likely to be targeted by coordinated harassers from fringe communities like 4chan. First, we characterize and model YouTube videos along several axes (metadata, audio transcripts, thumbnails) based on a ground truth dataset of videos that were targeted by raids. Then, we use an ensemble of classifiers to determine the likelihood that a video will be raided with very good results (AUC up to 94%). Overall, our work provides an important first step towards deploying proactive systems to detect and mitigate coordinated hate attacks on platforms like YouTube.},

abstract = {News recommender systems are aimed to personalize users experiences and help them discover relevant articles from a large and dynamic search space. Therefore, news domain is a challenging scenario for recommendations, due to its sparse user profiling, fast growing number of items, accelerated item's value decay, and users preferences dynamic shift.Deep Learning (DL) have achieved a great success in complex domains, such as computer vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine translation, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. Therefore, it became a mainstream approach in Recommender Systems research only since 2016.The main objective of this research is the investigation, design, implementation and evaluation of a Meta-Architecture for personalized news recommendations using deep neural networks.As information about users' past interactions is scarce in such cold-start scenario, user context and session information are explicitly modeled, as well as past user sessions, when available. Users' past behaviors and item features are both considered in an hybrid session-aware recommendation approach. The recommendation task addressed in this work is next-item prediction for user sessions: "what is the next most likely article a user might read in a session?"This paper presents the research methodology for this Doctoral research, the proposed Meta-Architecture and some preliminary results, as well as the next research challenges.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown great promise in unsupervised representation learning (URL) for multivariate time series, because URL has the capability in learning generalizable representation for many downstream tasks without using inaccessible labels. However, existing approaches usually adopt the models originally designed for other domains (e.g., computer vision) to encode the time series data and rely on strong assumptions to design learning objectives, which limits their ability to perform well. To deal with these problems, we propose a novel URL framework for multivariate time series by learning time-series-specific shapelet-based representation through a popular contrasting learning paradigm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that explores the shapelet-based embedding in the unsupervised general-purpose representation learning. A unified shapelet-based encoder and a novel learning objective with multi-grained contrasting and multi-scale alignment are particularly designed to achieve our goal, and a data augmentation library is employed to improve the generalization. We conduct extensive experiments using tens of real-world datasets to assess the representation quality on many downstream tasks, including classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method against not only URL competitors, but also techniques specially designed for downstream tasks.

abstract = {In this work we investigate eye movement analysis as a new modality for recognising human activity. We devise 90 different features based on the main eye movement characteristics: saccades, fixations and blinks. The features are derived from eye movement data recorded using a wearable electrooculographic (EOG) system. We describe a recognition methodology that combines minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection (mRMR) with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We validate the method in an eight participant study in an office environment using five activity classes: copying a text, reading a printed paper, taking hand-written notes, watching a video and browsing the web. In addition, we include periods with no specific activity. Using a person-independent (leave-one-out) training scheme, we obtain an average precision of 76.1% and recall of 70.5% over all classes and participants. We discuss the most relevant features and show that eye movement analysis is a rich and thus promising modality for activity recognition.},

abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting poses a major challenge in continual learning where the old knowledge is forgotten when the model is updated on new tasks. Existing solutions tend to solve this challenge through generative models or exemplar-replay strategies. However, such methods may not alleviate the issue that the low-quality samples are generated or selected for the replay, which would directly reduce the effectiveness of the model, especially in the class imbalance, noise, or redundancy scenarios. Accordingly, how to select a suitable coreset during continual learning becomes significant in such setting. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages continual coreset sampling (CCS) to address these challenges. We aim to select the most representative subsets during each iteration. When the model is trained on new tasks, it closely approximates/matches the gradient of both the previous and current tasks with respect to the model parameters. This way, adaptation of the model to new datasets could be more efficient. Furthermore, different from the old data storage for maintaining the old knowledge, our approach choose to preserving them in the latent space. We augment the previous classes in the embedding space as the pseudo sample vectors from the old encoder output, strengthened by the joint training with selected new data. It could avoid data privacy invasions in a real-world application when we update the model. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach over various CV/NLP datasets under against current baselines, and we also indicate the obvious improvement of model adaptation and forgetting reduction in a data-free manner.},

abstract = {We describe LASER, a scalable response prediction platform currently used as part of a social network advertising system. LASER enables the familiar logistic regression model to be applied to very large scale response prediction problems, including ones beyond advertising. Though the underlying model is well understood, we apply a whole-system approach to address model accuracy, scalability, explore-exploit, and real-time inference. To facilitate training with both large numbers of training examples and high dimensional features on commodity clustered hardware, we employ the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Because online advertising applications are much less static than classical presentations of response prediction, LASER employs a number of techniques that allows it to adapt in real time. LASER models can be divided into components with different re-training frequencies, allowing us to learn from changes in ad campaign performance frequently without incurring the cost of retraining larger, more stable sections of the model. Thompson sampling during online inference further helps by efficiently balancing exploration of new ads with exploitation of long running ones. To enable predictions made with the most recent feature data, we employ a range of techniques, including extensive caching and lazy evaluation, to permit real time, low latency scoring. LASER models are defined using a configuration language that ties together the training, validation, and inference pieces and permits even non-programming analysts to experiment with different model structures without modifications to code or interruptions to running servers. Finally, we show via extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests that this system provides significant benefits to prediction accuracy, gains in revenue and CTR, and reductions in system latency.},

abstract = {Several recent discourse parsers have employed fully-supervised machine learning approaches. These methods require human annotators to beforehand create an extensive training corpus, which is a time-consuming and costly process. On the other hand, unlabeled data is abundant and cheap to collect. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised method for discourse relation classification based on the analysis of co-occurring features in unlabeled data, which is then taken into account for extending the feature vectors given to a classifier. Our experimental results on the RST Discourse Tree-bank corpus and Penn Discourse Treebank indicate that the proposed method brings a significant improvement in classification accuracy and macro-average F-score when small training datasets are used. For instance, with training sets of c.a. 1000 labeled instances, the proposed method brings improvements in accuracy and macro-average F-score up to 50% compared to a baseline classifier. We believe that the proposed method is a first step towards detecting low-occurrence relations, which is useful for domains with a lack of annotated data.},

abstract = {Cross-domain recommendation aims to leverage knowledge from multiple domains to alleviate the data sparsity and cold-start problems in traditional recommender systems. One popular paradigm is to employ overlapping user representations to establish domain connections, thereby improving recommendation performance in all scenarios. Nevertheless, the general practice of this approach is to train user embeddings in each domain separately and then aggregate them in a plain manner, often ignoring potential cross-domain similarities between users and items. Furthermore, considering that their training objective is recommendation task-oriented without specific regularizations, the optimized embeddings disregard the interest alignment among user’s views, and even violate the user’s original interest distribution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-domain recommendation framework, namely COAST, to improve recommendation performance on dual domains by perceiving the cross-domain similarity between entities and aligning user interests. Specifically, we first construct a unified cross-domain heterogeneous graph and redefine the message passing mechanism of graph convolutional networks to capture high-order similarity of users and items across domains. Targeted at user interest alignment, we develop deep insights from two more fine-grained perspectives of user-user and user-item interest invariance across domains by virtue of affluent unsupervised and semantic signals. We conduct intensive experiments on multiple tasks, constructed from two large recommendation data sets. Extensive results show COAST consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain recommendation algorithms as well as classic single-domain recommendation methods.},

abstract = {Bounce rate prediction for clicked ads in sponsored search advertising is crucial for improving the quality of ads shown to the user. Bounce rate represents the proportion of landing pages for clicked ads on which users spend less than a specified time signifying that the user did not find a possible match of their query intent with the landing page content. In the pay-per-click revenue model for search engines, higher bounce rates mean advertisers get charged without meaningful user engagement, which impacts user and advertiser retention in long term. In real-time search engine settings complex ML models are prohibitive due to stringent latency requirements. Also historical logs are ineffective for rare queries (tail) where the data is sparse, as well as for matching user intent to adcopy when the query and bidded keywords don’t exactly overlap (smart match). In this paper, we propose a real-time bounce rate prediction system that leverages lightweight features like modified tf, positional and proximity features computed from ad landing pages and improves prediction for rare queries. The model preserves privacy and uses no user based feature. The entire ensemble is trained on millions of examples from the offline user log of the Bing commercial search engine and improves the ranking metrics for tail queries and smart match by more than 2x compared to a model that only uses ad-copy-advertiser features.},

abstract = {Nowadays, end users can personalize their smart devices and web applications by defining or reusing IF-THEN rules through dedicated End-User Development (EUD) tools. Despite apparent simplicity, such tools present their own set of issues. The emerging and increasing complexity of the Internet of Things, for example, is barely taken into account, and the number of possible combinations between triggers and actions of different smart devices and web applications is continuously growing. Such a large design space makes end-user personalization a complex task for non-programmers, and motivates the need of assisting users in easily discovering and managing rules and functionality, e.g., through recommendation techniques. In this article, we tackle the emerging problem of recommending IF-THEN rules to end users by presenting RecRules, a hybrid and semantic recommendation system. Through a mixed content and collaborative approach, the goal of RecRules is to recommend by functionality: it suggests rules based on their final purposes, thus overcoming details like manufacturers and brands. The algorithm uses a semantic reasoning process to enrich rules with semantic information, with the aim of uncovering hidden connections between rules in terms of shared functionality. Then, it builds a collaborative semantic graph, and it exploits different types of path-based features to train a learning to rank algorithm and compute top-N recommendations. We evaluate RecRules through different experiments on real user data extracted from IFTTT, one of the most popular EUD tools. Results are promising: they show the effectiveness of our approach with respect to other state-of-the-art algorithms and open the way for a new class of recommender systems for EUD that take into account the actual functionality needed by end users.},

In this study, we propose a novel deep time-aware approach designed to model sequences of users' activities and capture implicit temporal signals of users' conversion intents.

abstract = {Tabular data pervades the landscape of the World Wide Web, playing a foundational role in the digital architecture that underpins online information. Given the recent influence of large-scale pretrained models like ChatGPT and SAM across various domains, exploring the application of pretraining techniques for mining tabular data on the web has emerged as a highly promising research direction. Indeed, there have been some recent works around this topic where most (if not all) of them are limited in the scope of a fixed-schema/single table. Due to the scale of the dataset and the parameter size of the prior models, we believe that we have not reached the ''BERT moment'' for the ubiquitous tabular data. The development on this line significantly lags behind the counterpart research domains such as natural language processing. In this work, we first identify the crucial challenges behind tabular data pretraining, particularly overcoming the cross-table hurdle. As a pioneering endeavor, this work mainly (i)-contributes a high-quality real-world tabular dataset, (ii)-proposes an innovative, generic, and efficient cross-table pretraining framework, dubbed as CM2, where the core to it comprises a semantic-aware tabular neural network that uniformly encodes heterogeneous tables without much restriction and (iii)-introduces a novel pretraining objective --- prompt Masked Table Modeling (pMTM) --- inspired by NLP but intricately tailored to scalable pretraining on tables. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CM2's state-of-the-art performance and validate that cross-table pretraining can enhance various downstream tasks.},

However, current RL-based RS research commonly has a large reality gap. In this paper, we introduce the first open-source real-world dataset, RL4RS, hoping to replace the artificial datasets and semi-simulated RS datasets previous studies used due to the resource limitation of the RL-based RS domain. Unlike academic RL research, RL-based RS suffers from the difficulties of being well-validated before deployment. We attempt to propose a new systematic evaluation framework, including evaluation of environment simulation, evaluation on environments, and counterfactual policy evaluation. In summary, the RL4RS (Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems), a new resource with special concerns on the reality gaps, contains two real-world datasets, data understanding tools, tuned simulation environments, related advanced RL baselines, batch RL baselines, and counterfactual policy evaluation algorithms.

abstract = {Cloud services are omnipresent and critical cloud service failure is a fact of life. In order to retain customers and prevent revenue loss, it is important to provide high reliability guarantees for these services. One way to do this is by predicting outages in advance, which can help in reducing the severity as well as time to recovery. It is difficult to forecast critical failures due to the rarity of these events. Moreover, critical failures are ill-defined in terms of observable data. Our proposed method, Outage-Watch, defines critical service outages as deteriorations in the Quality of Service (QoS) captured by a set of metrics. Outage-Watch detects such outages in advance by using current system state to predict whether the QoS metrics will cross a threshold and initiate an extreme event. A mixture of Gaussian is used to model the distribution of the QoS metrics for flexibility and an extreme event regularizer helps in improving learning in tail of the distribution. An outage is predicted if the probability of any one of the QoS metrics crossing threshold changes significantly. Our evaluation on a real-world SaaS company dataset shows that Outage-Watch significantly outperforms traditional methods with an average AUC of 0.98. Additionally, Outage-Watch detects all the outages exhibiting a change in service metrics and reduces the Mean Time To Detection (MTTD) of outages by up to 88% when deployed in an enterprise cloud-service system, demonstrating efficacy of our proposed method.},

abstract = {The rapid adoption of smartphones along with a growing habit for using these devices as alarm clocks presents an opportunity to use this device as a sleep detector. This adds value to UbiComp and personal informatics in terms of user context and new performance data to collect and visualize, and it benefits healthcare as sleep is correlated with many health issues. To assess this opportunity, we collected one month of phone sensor and sleep diary entries from 27 people who have a variety of sleep contexts. We used this data to construct models that detect sleep and wake states, daily sleep quality, and global sleep quality. Our system classifies sleep state with 93.06% accuracy, daily sleep quality with 83.97% accuracy, and overall sleep quality with 81.48% accuracy. Individual models performed better than generally trained models, where the individual models require 3 days of ground truth data and 3 weeks of ground truth data to perform well on detecting sleep and sleep quality, respectively. Finally, the features of noise and movement were useful to infer sleep quality.},

abstract = {To the best of our knowledge, this article presents the first experiments on speech-based Automatic Personality Perception performed in a virtual immersive audio environment. The key-difference compared to all previous works in the literature is that, in a virtual immersive environment, people perceive not only the voice of the speakers, but also their position and distance in space. Therefore, it is possible to investigate for the first time whether people tend to attribute different traits to people speaking at different distances and, if so, whether this makes a difference in terms of Automatic Personality Perception. The experiments were performed over 360 recordings rendered at different distances (120 speakers including 60 female and 60 male). The results show that there are correlations between perceived distance and personality judgments. Furthermore, the experiments show that the performance in Automatic Personality Perception improves when taking perceived distance into account. These results are important because immersive environments are likely to become one of the main technological interfaces through which people interact with one another and with machines.},

abstract = {With the development of e-commerce, fraud behaviors have been becoming one of the biggest threats to the e-commerce business. Fraud behaviors seriously damage the ranking system of e-commerce platforms and adversely influence the shopping experience of users. It is of great practical value to detect fraud behaviors on e-commerce platforms. However, the task is non-trivial, since the adversarial action taken by fraudsters. Existing fraud detection systems used in the e-commerce industry easily suffer from performance decay and can not adapt to the upgrade of fraud patterns, as they take already known fraud behaviors as supervision information to detect other suspicious behaviors.In this article, we propose a competitive graph neural networks (CGNN)-based fraud detection system (eFraudCom) to detect fraud behaviors at one of the largest e-commerce platforms, “Taobao”1. In the eFraudCom system, (1) the competitive graph neural networks (CGNN) as the core part of eFraudCom can classify behaviors of users directly by modeling the distributions of normal and fraud behaviors separately; (2) some normal behaviors will be utilized as weak supervision information to guide the CGNN to build the profile for normal behaviors that are more stable than fraud behaviors. The algorithm dependency on fraud behaviors will be eliminated, which enables eFraudCom to detect fraud behaviors in presence of the new fraud patterns; (3) the mutual information regularization term can maximize the separability between normal and fraud behaviors to further improve CGNN. eFraudCom is implemented into a prototype system and the performance of the system is evaluated by extensive experiments. The experiments on two Taobao and two public datasets demonstrate that the proposed deep framework CGNN is superior to other baselines in detecting fraud behaviors. A case study on Taobao datasets verifies that CGNN is still robust when the fraud patterns have been upgraded.},

abstract = {This is a position paper that frames a networked home as a situated, user-centric multimedia system. The problem is important for two reasons - (a) the emergence of high speed networked connections alter media consumption and interaction practices and (b) ordinary consumers currently communicate everyday experiences through limited means (e.g. e-mail attachments). We need new mechanisms for networked creation and consumption of media, as well as new interaction paradigms that will allow us to utilize the full potential of the networked, multimedia environment. We envision an augmented user-context adaptive home that enables the user to rest, reflect, interact and communicate everyday experiences through multimedia. A key insight is that the practice of consumption, communication and interaction with media, across different devices and interaction modalities, affect the user context, and in turn is affected by it. The result is a highly personalized media practice for each user. We discuss three focal areas of our current research - (a) models for user context, (b) communication of meaning and (c) situated interaction. Modeling user context is challenging, and we present a novel multimodal context framework. In media communication, we examine research issues in media acquisition, media presentation and networked sharing. Situated multimedia frameworks are physically grounded systems, that require new analytical models, interaction paradigms, and additionally require new real-time concerns. Our framework is promising, and we believe will lead to rich collection of multimedia problems that incorporate networked interaction.},

Prof. Judy Kay from the University of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous computing, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester, a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of Academia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will discuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program committee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to align with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionally, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks, and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclusive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multimedia 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM travel grants. Over 20 local students have also been recruited as volunteers, benefiting from complimentary registration. Furthermore, we have arranged childcare facilities to accommodate attendees with young children. A welcome reception will take place on the 2nd day of the conference, followed by a gala dinner on the 3rd day, featuring exciting cultural performances.We hope you find this year's program engaging and thought-provoking and that it offers valuable opportunities to exchange ideas with fellow researchers and practitioners from around the globe. We also encourage you to take time to explore the beautiful city of Melbourne and its surrounding regions.},

Instead, sensor hub hardware, available in many smartphones today, can run continuous sensing at lower power while keeping the main processor idle. However, developers have to divide functionality between the main processor and the sensor hub. We implement MobileHub, a system that automatically rewrites applications to leverage the sensor hub without additional programming effort. MobileHub uses a combination of dynamic taint tracking and machine learning to learn when it is safe to leverage the sensor hub without affecting application semantics. We implement MobileHub in Android and prototype a sensor hub on a 8-bit AVR micro-controller. We experiment with 20 applications from Google Play. Our evaluation shows that MobileHub significantly reduces power consumption for continuous sensing apps.},

Other strategies exploit contextual aspects of music, not present in the signal, for example, community meta-data and trails of user interaction, as found, for instance, on social media platforms.

Ele.me, a prevalent on-demand food delivery platform in China, suffers from the negative impact of crawlers. The crawler detection systems face two major challenges: spatial patterns of the crawler behaviors and limited labeled data for training. In this paper, we present efficient solutions to tackle these challenges. Specifically, we propose a new Attributed Action Net (AANet for short) model to detect Location-Based Services~(LBS) crawlers and a three-stage learning framework to train the model. AANet consists of three different embedding modules, including the action token sequence, temporal-spatial attributes of users, and the context information of the raw data. We have deployed the model at Ele.me, and both offline experiments and online A/B tests show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art models for sequence data classification on the food delivery platform.},

abstract = {Model-free RL-based recommender systems have recently received increasing research attention due to their capability to handle partial feedback and long-term rewards. However, most existing research has ignored a critical feature in recommender systems: one user's feedback on the same item at different times is random. The stochastic rewards property essentially differs from that in classic RL scenarios with deterministic rewards, which makes RL-based recommender systems much more challenging. In this paper, we first demonstrate in a simulator environment where using direct stochastic feedback results in a significant drop in performance. Then to handle the stochastic feedback more efficiently, we design two stochastic reward stabilization frameworks that replace the direct stochastic feedback with that learned by a supervised model. Both frameworks are model-agnostic, i.e., they can effectively utilize various supervised models. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over different RL-based recommendation baselines with extensive experiments on a recommendation simulator as well as an industrial-level recommender system.},

abstract = {This paper describes our efforts to investigate factors in a user's browsing behavior to help automatically evaluate web pages that the user shows interest in. To evaluate a web page automatically, we have developed a client-side logging/analyzing tool: the GINIS Framework. We do not focus on clicking, scrolling, navigation, or duration of visit alone, but we propose integrating these patterns of interaction to recognize and evaluate a user's response to a given web page. Unlike most previous web studies that have analyzed access seen at proxies or server, this work focuses primarily on client site user behavior using a customized web browser. First, GINIS unobtrusively gathers logs of user behavior through the user's natural interaction with the web browser. Then it analyses the logs and extracts effective rules to evaluate web pages using a machine-learning method. Eventually, GINIS will be able to automatically evaluate web pages using these learned rules, after which the evaluation can be utilized in a variety of user profiling.},

Given the known instances of similar or dissimilar words, we estimated the parameters of the Mahalanobis distance. We compared a number of metrics in our experiments, and the results show that the proposed metric has a higher mean average precision than other metrics.},

abstract = {Trip planning services are employed extensively by users to compute paths between locations for many different use cases, including commuting to work, transportation of goods, and itinerary planning for tourists. In many scenarios, such as planning for a hiking trip, running training, or mountain cycling, it is desirable to provide users with personalized trips according to their preferences. Existing route planning systems for mountain activities recommend user-posted trips, along with ratings w.r.t. the route's difficulty, condition, or enjoyment it provides. However, users often want to define a specific trip by choosing the segments/trails they want to follow. Existing systems do not provide a rating for such trips, thus suffering from the cold-start problem. Also, the efforts to automatically infer such a rating have been limited. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring ratings for custom trips. We propose a machine-learning framework that encodes various rated trip features and employs random forest classifiers to infer ratings. We conduct feature engineering to encode information regarding a) trip location, b) trip elevation profile, c) closeness to points of interest, and d) closeness to locations of geotagged photos. Finally, we present the results of an ablation study on two real-world data sets and five different ratings. We evaluate the efficiency of our proposed approach and the effect each feature has on the rating inference accuracy.},

From a causal perspective, the challenge is to distinguish the stable causal relationships from the unstable spurious correlations across shifts. We describe a causal transfer random forest (CTRF) that combines existing training data with a small amount of data from a randomized experiment to train a model which is robust to the feature shifts and therefore transfers to a new targeting distribution. Theoretically, we justify the robustness of the approach against feature shifts with the knowledge from causal learning. Empirically, we evaluate the CTRF using both synthetic data experiments and real-world experiments in the Bing Ads platform, including a click prediction task and in the context of an end-to-end counterfactual optimization system. The proposed CTRF produces robust predictions and outperforms most baseline methods compared in the presence of feature shifts.},

abstract = {The task of item recommendation requires ranking a large catalogue of items given a context. Item recommendation algorithms are evaluated using ranking metrics that depend on the positions of relevant items. To speed up the computation of metrics, recent work often uses sampled metrics where only a smaller set of random items and the relevant items are ranked. This paper investigates sampled metrics in more detail and shows that they are inconsistent with their exact version, in the sense that they do not persist relative statements, e.g., recommender A is better than B, not even in expectation. Moreover, the smaller the sampling size, the less difference there is between metrics, and for very small sampling size, all metrics collapse to the AUC metric. We show that it is possible to improve the quality of the sampled metrics by applying a correction, obtained by minimizing different criteria such as bias or mean squared error. We conclude with an empirical evaluation of the naive sampled metrics and their corrected variants. To summarize, our work suggests that sampling should be avoided for metric calculation, however if an experimental study needs to sample, the proposed corrections can improve the quality of the estimate.},

In contrast to current implementations of a body camera that use a power-hungry default configuration and can only be turned on and off by an officer, we propose an idea that the camera should be autonomous and active all the time. By leveraging the information from an on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU), these autonomous cameras should dynamically adjust their configuration in order to keep the device under the desired energy budget. To enable such a system, we propose a distributed adaptive model predictive controller for a system of body cameras, which allows the collaboration between multiple cameras which is currently not available in existing implementations.},

We make three technical contributions: (1) A strategy that incrementally maintains classification inside an RDBMS. (2) An analysis of the above algorithm that shows that our algorithm is optimal among all deterministic algorithms (and asymptotically within a factor of 2 of a non-deterministic optimal strategy). (3) A novel hybrid-architecture based on the technical ideas that underlie the above algorithm which allows us to store only a fraction of the entities in memory. We apply our techniques to text processing, and we demonstrate that our algorithms provide an order of magnitude improvement over non-incremental approaches to classification on a variety of data sets, such as the Citeseer and DBLife.},

abstract = {Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) is an emerging technique with great potential to support health behavior by providing the right type and amount of support at the right time. A crucial aspect of JITAIs is properly timing the delivery of interventions, to ensure that a user is receptive and ready to process and use the support provided. Some prior works have explored the association of context and some user-specific traits on receptivity, and have built post-study machine-learning models to detect receptivity. For effective intervention delivery, however, a JITAI system needs to make in-the-moment decisions about a user's receptivity. To this end, we conducted a study in which we deployed machine-learning models to detect receptivity in the natural environment, i.e., in free-living conditions.We leveraged prior work regarding receptivity to JITAIs and deployed a chatbot-based digital coach - Ally - that provided physical-activity interventions and motivated participants to achieve their step goals. We extended the original Ally app to include two types of machine-learning model that used contextual information about a person to predict when a person is receptive: a static model that was built before the study started and remained constant for all participants and an adaptive model that continuously learned the receptivity of individual participants and updated itself as the study progressed. For comparison, we included a control model that sent intervention messages at random times. The app randomly selected a delivery model for each intervention message. We observed that the machine-learning models led up to a 40% improvement in receptivity as compared to the control model. Further, we evaluated the temporal dynamics of the different models and observed that receptivity to messages from the adaptive model increased over the course of the study.},

This strategy, although appropriate for initiating research, can lead to overtraining to the particular corpus. This article describes the operation of assert, a state-of-the art SRL system, and analyzes the robustness of the system when trained on one genre of data and used to label a different genre. As a starting point, results are first presented for training and testing the system on the PropBank corpus, which is annotated Wall Street Journal (WSJ) data. Experiments are then presented to evaluate the portability of the system to another source of data. These experiments are based on comparisons of performance using PropBanked WSJ data and PropBanked Brown Corpus data. The results indicate that whereas syntactic parses and argument identification transfer relatively well to a new corpus, argument classification does not. An analysis of the reasons for this is presented and these generally point to the nature of the more lexical/semantic features dominating the classification task where more general structural features are dominant in the argument identification task.},

abstract = {Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a compelling neuromorphic camera compared to conventional camera, but it suffers from fiercer noise. Due to the nature of irregular format and asynchronous readout, DVS data is always transformed into a regular tensor (e.g., 3D voxel or image) for deep learning method, which corrupts its own asynchronous properties. To maintain asynchronous, we establish an innovative asynchronous event denoise neural network, named AEDNet, which directly consumes the correlation of the irregular signal in spatial-temporal range without destroying its original structural property. Based on the property of continuation in temporal domain and discreteness in spatial domain, we decompose the DVS signal into two parts, i.e., temporal correlation and spatial affinity, and separately process these two parts. Our spatial feature embedding unit is a unique feature extraction module that extracts feature from event-level, which perfectly maintains its spatial-temporal correlation. To test effectiveness, we build a novel dataset named DVSCLEAN containing both simulated and real-world data. The experimental results of AEDNet achieve SOTA.},

abstract = {System level power management must consider the uncertainty and variability that come from the environment, the application and the hardware. A robust power management technique must be able to learn the optimal decision from past events and improve itself as the environment changes. This article presents a novel on-line power management technique based on model-free constrained reinforcement learning (Q-learning). The proposed learning algorithm requires no prior information of the workload and dynamically adapts to the environment to achieve autonomous power management. We focus on the power management of the peripheral device and the microprocessor, two of the basic components of a computer. Due to their different operating behaviors and performance considerations, these two types of devices require different designs of Q-learning agent. The article discusses system modeling and cost function construction for both types of Q-learning agent. Enhancement techniques are also proposed to speed up the convergence and better maintain the required performance (or power) constraint in a dynamic system with large variations. Compared with the existing machine learning based power management techniques, the Q-learning based power management is more flexible in adapting to different workload and hardware and provides a wider range of power-performance tradeoff.},

Using this system, users can easily generate a combined service plan that best suits their needs within a vast range of candidates. The system exploits the recent constructive preference elicitation framework, which allows us to flexibly model the exponentially large domain of bundle offers as an implicitly defined set of variables and constraints. The user preferences are modeled by a utility function estimated via coactive learning interaction, while iteratively generating high-utility recommendations through constraint optimization. In this paper, we detail the structure of our system, as well as the methodology and results of an empirical validation study which involved more than 130 participants. The system turned out to be highly usable with respect to both time and number of interactions, and its outputs were found much more satisfactory than those obtained with standard techniques used in the market.},

abstract = {User experience at social media and web platforms such as LinkedIn is heavily dependent on the performance and scalability of its products. Applications such as personalized search and recommendations require real-time scoring of millions of structured candidate documents associated with each query, with strict latency constraints. In such applications, the query incorporates the context of the user (in addition to search keywords if present), and hence can become very large, comprising of thousands of Boolean clauses over hundreds of document attributes. Consequently, candidate selection techniques need to be applied since it is infeasible to retrieve and score all matching documents from the underlying inverted index. We propose CaSMoS, a machine learned candidate selection framework that makes use of Weighted AND (WAND) query. Our framework is designed to prune irrelevant documents and retrieve documents that are likely to be part of the top-k results for the query. We apply a constrained feature selection algorithm to learn positive weights for feature combinations that are used as part of the weighted candidate selection query. We have implemented and deployed this system to be executed in real time using LinkedIn's Galene search platform. We perform extensive evaluation with different training data approaches and parameter settings, and investigate the scalability of the proposed candidate selection model. Our deployment of this system as part of LinkedIn's job recommendation engine has resulted in significant reduction in latency (up to 25%) without sacrificing the quality of the retrieved results, thereby paving the way for more sophisticated scoring models.},

abstract = {Graph representation learning has now become the de facto standard when dealing with graph-structured data. Using powerful tools from deep learning and graph neural networks, recent works have applied graph representation learning to time-evolving dynamic graphs and showed promising results. However, all the previous dynamic graph models require labeled samples to train, which might be costly to acquire in practice. Self-supervision offers a principled way of utilizing unlabeled data and has achieved great success in computer vision community. In this paper we propose debiased dynamic graph contrastive learning (DDGCL), the first self-supervised representation learning framework on dynamic graphs. The proposed model extends the contrastive learning idea to dynamic graphs via contrasting two nearby temporal views of the same node identity, with a time-dependent similarity critic. Inspired by recent theoretical developments contrastive learning, we propose a novel debiased GAN-type contrastive loss as the learning objective in order to correct the sampling bias occurred in negative sample construction process. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets via testing the DDGCL framework under two different self-supervision schemes: pretraining and finetuning and multi task learning. The results show that using a simple time-aware GNN encoder, the performance of downstream tasks is significantly improved under either scheme to closely match, or even outperform state-of-the-art dynamic graph models with more elegant encoder architectures. Further empirical evaluations suggest that the proposed approach offers more performance improvement than previously established self-supervision mechanisms over static graphs.},

However, recent research has indicated that visualization performance could be improved by adapting aspects of the visualization to the individual user. To this end, this article presents research aimed at supporting the design of novel user-adaptive visualization systems. In particular, we discuss results on using information on user eye gaze patterns while interacting with a given visualization to predict properties of the user's visualization task; the user's performance (in terms of predicted task completion time); and the user's individual cognitive abilities, such as perceptual speed, visual working memory, and verbal working memory. We provide a detailed analysis of different eye gaze feature sets, as well as over-time accuracies. We show that these predictions are significantly better than a baseline classifier even during the early stages of visualization usage. These findings are then discussed with a view to designing visualization systems that can adapt to the individual user in real time.},

Therefore, news domain is a challenging scenario for recommendations, due to its sparse user profiling, fast growing number of items, accelerated item's value decay, and users preferences dynamic shift.Some promising results have been recently achieved by the usage of Deep Learning techniques on Recommender Systems, specially for item's feature extraction and for session-based recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks.In this paper, it is proposed an instantiation of the CHAMELEON -- a Deep Learning Meta-Architecture for News Recommender Systems. This architecture is composed of two modules, the first responsible to learn news articles representations, based on their text and metadata, and the second module aimed to provide session-based recommendations using Recurrent Neural Networks.The recommendation task addressed in this work is next-item prediction for users sessions: "what is the next most likely article a user might read in a session?"Users sessions context is leveraged by the architecture to provide additional information in such extreme cold-start scenario of news recommendation. Users' behavior and item features are both merged in an hybrid recommendation approach.A temporal offline evaluation method is also proposed as a complementary contribution, for a more realistic evaluation of such task, considering dynamic factors that affect global readership interests like popularity, recency, and seasonality.Experiments with an extensive number of session-based recommendation methods were performed and the proposed instantiation of CHAMELEON meta-architecture obtained a significant relative improvement in top-n accuracy and ranking metrics (10% on Hit Rate and 13% on MRR) over the best benchmark methods.},

abstract = {This paper develops a classification of mobile interactions based on contextual information relevant to the mobile device user in journeys. Context-aware systems can be used to reduce the stress involved, support users in their activities and increase utility of travel time. But context is often portrayed as real, stable and structured, which can limit the value of applications as they lack dynamics and relevancy. This paper aims to classify mobile interactions in journeys by adopting an alternative view of context. It is argued that sensing less contextual information can be more valuable providing the most relevant information to the user can be identified. Context is explored using qualitative approaches that investigate user interactions during end-to-end journeys. The resulting classification serves as a basis for understanding mobile interactions and it assists designers and HCI practitioners to develop improved context-aware application.},

abstract = {It is increasingly suggested to identify Software Vulnerabilities (SVs) in code commits to give early warnings about potential security risks. However, there is a lack of effort to assess vulnerability-contributing commits right after they are detected to provide timely information about the exploitability, impact and severity of SVs. Such information is important to plan and prioritize the mitigation for the identified SVs. We propose a novel Deep multi-task learning model, DeepCVA, to automate seven Commit-level Vulnerability Assessment tasks simultaneously based on Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) metrics. We conduct large-scale experiments on 1,229 vulnerability-contributing commits containing 542 different SVs in 246 real-world software projects to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our model. We show that DeepCVA is the best-performing model with 38% to 59.8% higher Matthews Correlation Coefficient than many supervised and unsupervised baseline models. DeepCVA also requires 6.3 times less training and validation time than seven cumulative assessment models, leading to significantly less model maintenance cost as well. Overall, DeepCVA presents the first effective and efficient solution to automatically assess SVs early in software systems.},

Following up on the successful in-person conference held last year in Sweden, this year's theme is "HRI in the Real World," and focuses on advances that aim to bring human-robot interaction out of the lab and into everyday life.One aspect of this that we are very excited about is the introduction of a robot challenge to the conference activities, where teams from around the world will showcase their research and development via actual, interactive robots in the "real world" of an academic conference. It is our hope that this feature will grow and develop over the coming years into a staple of the HRI conference.This year's HRI conference saw an impressive surge in global interest, with 352 full paper submissions from around the world, marking a significant 40% increase compared to the previous year. These papers were categorized under relevant thematic subcommittees and underwent a double-blind review process, a rebuttal phase, and selective shepherding by the HRI program committee. From this process, 87 outstanding papers (24.7%) were chosen for full presentation at the conference. Reflecting our joint sponsorship with IEEE and ACM, all accepted papers will be accessible in the ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore.},

abstract = {Within the past decade, mobile computing has morphed into a principal form of human communication, business, and social interaction. Unfortunately, the energy demands of newer ambient intelligence and collaborative technologies on mobile devices have greatly overwhelmed modern energy storage abilities. This paper proposes several novel techniques that exploit spatiotemporal and device context to predict device interface configurations that can optimize energy consumption in mobile embedded systems. These techniques, which include variants of linear discriminant analysis, linear logistic regression, non-linear logistic regression with neural networks, and k-nearest neighbor are explored and compared on synthetic and user traces from real-world usage studies. The experimental results show that up to 90% successful prediction is possible with neural networks and k-nearest neighbor algorithms, improving upon prediction strategies in prior work by approximately 50%. Further, an average improvement of 24% energy savings is achieved compared to state-of-the-art prior work on energy-efficient location-sensing.},

abstract = {Mood inference with mobile sensing data has been studied in ubicomp literature over the last decade. This inference enables context-aware and personalized user experiences in general mobile apps and valuable feedback and interventions in mobile health apps. However, even though model generalization issues have been highlighted in many studies, the focus has always been on improving the accuracies of models using different sensing modalities and machine learning techniques, with datasets collected in homogeneous populations. In contrast, less attention has been given to studying the performance of mood inference models to assess whether models generalize to new countries. In this study, we collected a mobile sensing dataset with 329K self-reports from 678 participants in eight countries (China, Denmark, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay, UK) to assess the effect of geographical diversity on mood inference models. We define and evaluate country-specific (trained and tested within a country), continent-specific (trained and tested within a continent), country-agnostic (tested on a country not seen on training data), and multi-country (trained and tested with multiple countries) approaches trained on sensor data for two mood inference tasks with population-level (non-personalized) and hybrid (partially personalized) models. We show that partially personalized country-specific models perform the best yielding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores of the range 0.78--0.98 for two-class (negative vs. positive valence) and 0.76--0.94 for three-class (negative vs. neutral vs. positive valence) inference. Further, with the country-agnostic approach, we show that models do not perform well compared to country-specific settings, even when models are partially personalized. We also show that continent-specific models outperform multi-country models in the case of Europe. Overall, we uncover generalization issues of mood inference models to new countries and how the geographical similarity of countries might impact mood inference.},

abstract = {Nowadays, most mobile applications rely on device screen locking mechanisms for ensuring practical security, which expects the users to explicitly authenticate with a PIN or biometric irrespective of the perceived threats. Owing to this usability issues, many avoid using device locks potentially compromising the security. To overcome the limitations of this binary approach, we present an implicit authentication framework called PRISM (Policy-driven Risk-based Implicit locking for improving the Security of Mobile end-user devices). It provides risk based authentication by detecting anomalies in the usual behavior patterns of the users which include their expected locations, activities and application usage. Its device unlocking decisions are driven by policies that are defined either automatically by mining sensor data or manually by the end-users. Our experiments show that PRISM is able to discover useful behavior patterns efficiently even with limited data. The number of required explicit authentications is significantly reduced while assuring the preferred security for everyday scenarios.},

Recently, learning-based program repair has gained extensive attention and became the state-of-the-art in practice. But it still leaves plenty of space for improvement. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end solution&nbsp;TransRepair to locate the error lines and create the correct substitute for a C program simultaneously. Superior to the counterpart, our approach takes into account the context of erroneous code and diagnostic compilation feedback. Then we devise a Transformer-based neural network to learn the ways of repair from the erroneous code as well as its context and the diagnostic feedback. To increase the effectiveness of TransRepair, we summarize 5 types and 74 fine-grained sub-types of compilations errors from two real-world program datasets and the Internet. Then a program corruption technique is developed to synthesize a large dataset with 1,821,275 erroneous C programs. Through the extensive experiments, we demonstrate that TransRepair outperforms the state-of-the-art in both single repair accuracy and full repair accuracy. Further analysis sheds light on the strengths and weaknesses in the contemporary solutions for future improvement.},

Most of the data in textual format, which contains plentiful knowledge and binds itself with the clinical involvement to improve the health services. Generated data is unstructured or semi-structured like Log-Files, to analyze these large amount of data manually is quite time consuming and tedious task. Text Data mining and Machine learning approaches helps to generate actual knowledge from these free-text raw medical records (FMRs), effectively and efficiently. This paper, focuses on extracting the silent features or facts of Bio-medical text data and classify them into structured manner based on their relevance with respect to topics. This work introduces an approach towards conflict detection in Name-Entities in Biomedical document, with the help of use of Topic Model in supervised learning fashion. A novel adaption upgrading scheme along with topic model has been proposed, which minify the expansion of unstructured Bio-medical text data. Along with this, ambiguity of Bio-medical terms also helps to achieve the goal, probabilistic classification. UMLS thesaurus applied on text corpora in addition to determine the exactness of this approach.},

abstract = {Personalized recommendation with user interactions has become increasingly popular nowadays in many applications with dynamic change of contents (news, media, etc.). Existing approaches model user interactive recommendation as a contextual bandit problem to balance the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. However, these solutions require a large number of interactions with each user to provide high quality personalized recommendations. To mitigate this limitation, we design a novel deep neural memory augmented mechanism to model and track the history state for each user based on his previous interactions. As such, the user's preferences on new items can be quickly learned within a small number of interactions. Moreover, we develop new algorithms to leverage large amount of all users' history data for offline model training and online model fine tuning for each user with the focus of policy evaluation. Extensive experiments on different synthetic and real-world datasets validate that our proposed approach consistently outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art approaches.},

Our work analyzes the quality of crowdsourced cellular signal measurements in the context of basestation localization, using large international public datasets (419M signal measurements and 1M cells) and corresponding ground truth values. Performing localization using raw received signal strength (RSS) data produces poor results and very high variance. Applying supervised learning improves results moderately, but variance remains high. Instead, we propose feature clustering, a novel application of unsupervised learning to detect hidden correlation between measurement instances, their features, and localization accuracy. Our results identify RSS standard deviation and RSS-weighted dispersion mean as key features that correlate with highly predictive measurement samples for both sparse and dense measurements respectively. Finally, we show how optimizing crowdsourcing measurements for these two features dramatically improves localization accuracy and reduces variance.},

This is specially true for fields such as Computer Science and Electric Engineering, where conference publications are crucial. However, the majority of the existing approaches for assessing the quality of publication venues has been proposed for journals. In this paper, we characterize a large number of features that can be used as criteria to assess the quality of scientific conferences and study how these several features can be automatically combined by means of machine learning techniques to effectively perform this task. Within the features studied are citations, submission and acceptance rates, tradition of the conference, and reputation of the program committee members. Among our several findings, we can cite that: (1) separating high quality conferences from medium and low quality ones can be performed quite effectively, but separating the last two types is a much harder task; and (2) citation features followed by those associated with the tradition of the conference are the most important ones for the task.},

abstract = {The interplay between the response latency of web search systems and users’ search experience has only recently started to attract research attention, despite the important implications of response latency on monetisation of such systems. In this work, we carry out two complementary studies to investigate the impact of response latency on users’ searching behaviour in web search engines. We first conduct a controlled user study to investigate the sensitivity of users to increasing delays in response latency. This study shows that the users of a fast search system are more sensitive to delays than the users of a slow search system. Moreover, the study finds that users are more likely to notice the response latency delays beyond a certain latency threshold, their search experience potentially being affected. We then analyse a large number of search queries obtained from Yahoo Web Search to investigate the impact of response latency on users’ click behaviour. This analysis demonstrates the significant change in click behaviour as the response latency increases. We also find that certain user, context, and query attributes play a role in the way increasing response latency affects the click behaviour. To demonstrate a possible use case for our findings, we devise a machine-learning framework that leverages the latency impact, together with other features, to predict whether a user will issue any clicks on web search results. As a further extension of this use case, we investigate whether this machine-learning framework can be exploited to help search engines reduce their energy consumption during query processing.},

abstract = {Information extraction aims at extracting entities, relations, and so on, in text to support information retrieval systems. To extract information, researchers have considered multitask learning (ML) approaches. The conventional ML approach learns shared features across tasks, with the assumption that these features capture sufficient task interactions to learn expressive shared representations for task classification. However, such an assumption is flawed in different perspectives. First, the shared representation may contain noise introduced by another task; tasks coupled for multitask learning may have different complexities but this approach treats all tasks equally; the conventional approach has a flat structure that hinders the learning of explicit interactions. This approach, however, learns implicit interactions across tasks and often has a generalization ability that has benefited the learning of multitasks. In this article, we take advantage of implicit interactions learned by conventional approaches while alleviating the issues mentioned above by developing a Recurrent Interaction Network with an effective Early Prediction Integration (RIN-EPI) for multitask learning. Specifically, RIN-EPI learns implicit and explicit interactions across two different but related tasks. To effectively learn explicit interactions across tasks, we consider the correlations among the outputs of related tasks. It is, however, obvious that task outputs are unobservable during training, so we leverage the predictions at intermediate layers (referred to as early predictions) as proxies as well as shared features across tasks to learn explicit interactions through attention mechanisms and sequence learning models. By recurrently learning explicit interactions, we gradually improve predictions for the individual tasks in the multitask learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RIN-EPI on the learning of two mainstream multitasks for information extraction: (1) entity recognition and relation classification and (2) aspect and opinion term co-extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the RIN-EPI architecture, where we achieve state-of-the-art results on several benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {Auction-based recommender systems are prevalent in online advertising platforms, but they are typically optimized to allocate recommendation slots based on immediate expected return metrics, neglecting the downstream effects of recommendations on user behavior. In this study, we employ reinforcement learning to optimize for long-term return metrics in an auction-based recommender system. Utilizing temporal difference learning, a fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm, we implement a one-step policy improvement approach that biases the system towards recommendations with higher long-term user engagement metrics. This optimizes value over long horizons while maintaining compatibility with the auction framework. Our approach is grounded in dynamic programming ideas which show that our method provably improves upon the existing auction-based base policy. Through an online A/B test conducted on an auction-based recommender system which handles billions of impressions and users daily, we empirically establish that our proposed method outperforms the current production system in terms of long-term user engagement metrics.},

abstract = {Current music recommender systems typically act in a greedy manner by recommending songs with the highest user ratings. Greedy recommendation, however, is suboptimal over the long term: it does not actively gather information on user preferences and fails to recommend novel songs that are potentially interesting. A successful recommender system must balance the needs to explore user preferences and to exploit this information for recommendation. This article presents a new approach to music recommendation by formulating this exploration-exploitation trade-off as a reinforcement learning task. To learn user preferences, it uses a Bayesian model that accounts for both audio content and the novelty of recommendations. A piecewise-linear approximation to the model and a variational inference algorithm help to speed up Bayesian inference. One additional benefit of our approach is a single unified model for both music recommendation and playlist generation. We demonstrate the strong potential of the proposed approach with simulation results and a user study.},

abstract = {Although documents have hundreds of thousands of unique words, only a small number of words are significantly useful for intelligent services. For this reason, feature extraction has become an important issue to be addressed in various fields, such as information retrieval, text mining, pattern recognition, etc. Numerous supporting tools for feature extraction are available, but most of them deal with text as a simple literal. Unfortunately, text is not just a literal, but a semantically significant unit including linguistic characteristics. So, we need customized extraction methods that consider the characteristics of source documents. PicAChoo stands for 'Pick And Choose', and it provides an environment which enables feature extraction methods using the structure of sentences and the part-of-speech information of words. Moreover, we suggest dynamic composition of different extraction methods without hard-coding.},

abstract = {Today’s mobile phones are far from the mere communication devices they were 10 years ago. Equipped with sophisticated sensors and advanced computing hardware, phones can be used to infer users’ location, activity, social setting, and more. As devices become increasingly intelligent, their capabilities evolve beyond inferring context to predicting it, and then reasoning and acting upon the predicted context. This article provides an overview of the current state of the art in mobile sensing and context prediction paving the way for full-fledged anticipatory mobile computing. We present a survey of phenomena that mobile phones can infer and predict, and offer a description of machine learning techniques used for such predictions. We then discuss proactive decision making and decision delivery via the user-device feedback loop. Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of anticipatory mobile computing.},

abstract = {The transportation mode such as walking, cycling or on a train denotes an important characteristic of the mobile user's context. In this paper, we propose an approach to inferring a user's mode of transportation based on the GPS sensor on her mobile device and knowledge of the underlying transportation network. The transportation network information considered includes real time bus locations, spatial rail and spatial bus stop information. We identify and derive the relevant features related to transportation network information to improve classification effectiveness. This approach can achieve over 93.5% accuracy for inferring various transportation modes including: car, bus, aboveground train, walking, bike, and stationary. Our approach improves the accuracy of detection by 17% in comparison with the GPS only approach, and 9% in comparison with GPS with GIS models. The proposed approach is the first to distinguish between motorized transportation modes such as bus, car and aboveground train with such high accuracy. Additionally, if a user is travelling by bus, we provide further information about which particular bus the user is riding. Five different inference models including Bayesian Net, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Na\"{\i}ve Bayesian and Multilayer Perceptron, are tested in the experiments. The final classification system is deployed and available to the public.},

Our study is part of growing research efforts examining how high-dimensional data collected from mobile devices can be utilized to infer users' dynamic preferences. We present a novel method for inferring contextual user preferences by using an unsupervised deep learning technique applied to mobile sensor data. We train an auto-encoder for each user preference with contextual data that based on past user interaction with the system. Given new contextual sensor data from a user, the patterns discovered from each auto-encoder are used to predict the most likely preference in the given context. This can greatly enhance a variety of services, such as mobile online advertising and context-aware recommender systems. We demonstrate our contribution with a point of interest (POI) recommender system in which we label contextual preferences based on the interaction of users with categories of items.

UbiComp and ISWC are premier interdisciplinary venues for international researchers, designers, developers, practitioners and educators in the field to present and discuss novel and impactful research in interactive, mobile, wearable and ubiquitous computing. The companion program has traditionally been a very important part of the UbiComp/ISWC conference series.UbiComp/ISWC 2024 is held from October 5 to 9, 2024 in Melbourne, Australia. Originally, UbiComp/ISWC was scheduled to take place in Melbourne in 2021. However, due to the significant impact of COVID-19, our community decided to postpone conferences taking place in their traditional form until last year, when UbiComp took place as an in-person event in Mexico. Now, in 2024 we look to consolidate the strength and ties in our community by having another fully in-person event and hoping to welcome a new generation of researchers to meet and explore the wonderful people that make up our community.},

abstract = {Successfully structuring information in databases, OLAP cubes, and XML is a crucial element in managing data nowadays. However this process brought new challenges to usability. It is difficult for users to switch from common communication means using natural language to data models (e.g., database schemas) that are hard to work with and understand, especially for occasional users. This important issue is under intense scrutiny in the database community (e.g., keyword search over databases and query relaxation techniques), and the information extraction community (e.g., linking structured and unstructured data). However, there is still no comprehensive solution that automatically generates an OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) query and chooses a visualization based on textual content with high precision. We present such a method. We discuss how to dynamically generate interpretations of a textual content as an OLAP query, select the best visualization, and retrieve on the fly corresponding data from a data warehouse. To provide the most relevant aggregation results, we consider the user's actual context, described by a document's content. Moreover we provide a prototypical implementation of our method, the Text-To-Query system (T2Q) and show how T2Q can be successfully applied to an enterprise scenario as an extension for an office application.},

abstract = {Scene graph generation (SGG) has been developed to detect objects and their relationships from the visual data and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Existing works have focused on extracting object context for SGG. However, very few works have attempted to exploit implicit contextual correlations among relationships of the objects. Furthermore, most existing SGG schemes rely on high-level features to predict the predicates while overlooking the potential inherent association of low-level features with the object relationships. We present in this article a novel scheme to capture enhanced contextual information for both objects and relationships. We design a Dual-branch Context Analysis Transformer (DCAT) architecture to extract both object context and relationship context from the visual data with dual transformer branches and then effectively fuse both high-level and low-level features by an adaptive approach to facilitate relationship prediction. Specifically, we first conduct feature representation learning to enrich relation representations by the visual, spatial, and linguistic feature extractors. Next, two transformer branches are designed to leverage the modeling of global associative interaction and mine the hidden association among objects and relationships. Then, we devise a novel feature disentangling method to decouple contextualized high-level features with guidance from the visual semantics. Finally, we develop a refined attention module to perform low-level feature recalibration for the refinement of the final predicate prediction. Experiments on Visual Genome and Action Genome datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DCAT for both image and video SGG settings. Moreover, we also test the quality of the generated image scene graphs to verify the generalizability on downstream tasks like sentence-to-graph retrieval and image retrieval.},

Therefore, our system was trained on 216,871 verbal predicates and 42,386 nonverbal ones consisting of 40,813 nouns and 1,573 adjectives with 33 semantic classes.

However, for the same feature, people can express it with many different words or phrases. To produce a useful summary, these words and phrases, which are domain synonyms, need to be grouped under the same feature group. Although several methods have been proposed to extract product features from reviews, limited work has been done on clustering or grouping of synonym features. This paper focuses on this task. Classic methods for solving this problem are based on unsupervised learning using some forms of distributional similarity. However, we found that these methods do not do well. We then model it as a semi-supervised learning problem. Lexical characteristics of the problem are exploited to automatically identify some labeled examples. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

abstract = {Many recent advances in neural information retrieval models, which predict top-K items given a query, learn directly from a large training set of (query, item) pairs. However, they are often insufficient when there are many previously unseen (query, item) combinations, often referred to as the cold start problem. Furthermore, the search system can be biased towards items that are frequently shown to a query previously, also known as the 'rich get richer' (a.k.a. feedback loop) problem. In light of these problems, we observed that most online content platforms have both a search and a recommender system that, while having heterogeneous input spaces, can be connected through their common output item space and a shared semantic representation. In this paper, we propose a new Zero-Shot Heterogeneous Transfer Learning framework that transfers learned knowledge from the recommender system component to improve the search component of a content platform. First, it learns representations of items and their natural-language features by predicting (item, item) correlation graphs derived from the recommender system as an auxiliary task. Then, the learned representations are transferred to solve the target search retrieval task, performing query-to-item prediction without having seen any (query, item) pairs in training. We conduct online and offline experiments on one of the world's largest search and recommender systems from Google, and present the results and lessons learned. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve high performance on offline search retrieval tasks, and more importantly, achieved significant improvements on relevance and user interactions over the highly-optimized production system in online experiments.},

But, to infer much richer story of context-aware applications, it is necessary to recognize the smartphone surfaces - for example on the sofa, inside the backpack, on the plastic chair, in a drawer or in your pant-pocket. This paper presents SurfaceSense, a two-tier, simple, inexpensive placement-aware technique, that uses smartphone's embedded accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, microphone and proximity sensor to infer where phone is placed. It does not require any external hardware and provides 91.75% recognition accuracy on 13 different surfaces.},

We show that our approach can be scaled up using a novel music auto-tagging technique and we compare it in a live user study to: two non-hybrid solutions, either based on tags or on semantic relations; and to a context-free but personalized recommendation approach. In the considered scenario, i.e., a situation defined by a context (the POI), we show that personalization (via music preference) is not sufficient and it is important to implement effective adaptation techniques to the user's context. In fact, we show that the users are more satisfied with the recommendations generated by combining the tag-based and knowledge-based context adaptation techniques, which exploit orthogonal types of relations between places and music tracks.},

abstract = {The recent Programming By Example (PBE) techniques such as FlashFill have shown great promise for enabling end-users to perform data transformation tasks using input-output examples. Since examples are inherently an under-specification, there are typically a large number of hypotheses conforming to the examples, and the PBE techniques suffer from scalability issues for finding the intended program amongst the large space.We present a semi-supervised learning technique to significantly reduce this ambiguity by using the logical information present in the input data to guide the synthesis algorithm. We develop a data structure InputDataGraph to succinctly represent a large set of logical patterns that are shared across the input data, and use this graph to efficiently learn substring expressions in a new PBE system BlinkFill. We evaluate BlinkFill on 207 real-world benchmarks and show that BlinkFill is significantly faster (on average 41x) and requires fewer input-output examples (1.27 vs 1.53) to learn the desired transformations in comparison to FlashFill.},

We conducted a study where, via a dedicated logging app, we collected daily mobile phone activity data from a sample of 340 participants for a period of four weeks. Through an unsupervised learning approach and a methodologically rigorous analysis, we reveal five generic phone use profiles which describe at least 10% of the participants each: limited use, business use, power use, and personality- &amp; externally induced problematic use. We provide evidence that intense mobile phone use alone does not predict negative well-being. Instead, our approach automatically revealed two groups with tendencies for lower well-being, which are characterized by nightly phone use sessions.},

abstract = {The emergence of smart mobile devices has given rise to the development of context-aware systems that utilize sensors to collect available data about users. This data, in turn, is used in order to improve various services for the user. The development of such applications is inherently complex, since these applications adapt to changing context information, such as: physical context, computational context, and user tasks. Context information is gathered from a variety of sources that differ in the quality of information they produce and that are often failure-prone. Our study is part of a growing research effort that examines how data collected from mobile devices can be utilized to infer users' behavior and environment. We propose novel approaches that use a rich set of mobile sensors in order to infer unexplored users' contexts in personal models. We also suggest utilizing these high dimensional sensors, which represent users' context for a CARS (context-aware recommender system). For this purpose, we suggest several methods for reducing the dimensionality space by extracting latent contexts from data collected by mobile device sensors. Latent contexts are hidden context patterns, modeled as numeric vectors that are learned for each user automatically, by utilizing unsupervised deep learning techniques on the collected data. We also describe a novel latent context recommendation technique that uses latent contexts and improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art CARS. A preliminary analysis reveals encouraging insights regarding the feasibility of latent contexts and their utilization for context-aware recommendation systems.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of recognizing human actions captured with depth cameras. Human action recognition is a challenging task as the articulated action data is high dimensional in both spatial and temporal domains. An effective approach to handle this complexity is to divide human body into different body parts according to human skeletal joint positions, and performs recognition based on these part-based feature descriptors. Since different types of features could share some similar hidden structures, and different actions may be well characterized by properties common to all features (sharable structure) and those specific to a feature (specific structure), we propose a joint group sparse regression-based learning method to model each action. Our method can mine the sharable and specific structures among its part-based multiple features meanwhile imposing the importance of these part-based feature structures by joint group sparse regularization, in favor of discriminative part-based feature structure selection. To represent the dynamics and appearance of the human body parts, we employ part-based multiple features extracted from skeleton and depth data respectively. Then, using the group sparse regularization techniques, we have derived an algorithm for mining the key part-based features in the proposed learning framework. The resulting features derived from the learnt weight matrices are more discriminative for multi-task classification. Through extensive experiments on three public datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.},

Previous ASONAM conferences were held in Athens (2009), Odense (2010), Kaohsiung (2011), Istanbul (2012), Niagara Falls (2013), Beijing (2014), Paris (2015), San Francisco (2016), Sydney (2017), Barcelona (2018), Vancouver (2019), Virtual (2020), Virtual (2021). The pre-pandemic locations of the conferences have enabled the participants to enjoy local sights and to engage in person-to-person interactions, making new contacts and form new scientific collaborations. These possibilities were only available in a limited form during the virtual conferences. As the covid pandemic seems to be moving towards an endemic form it was decided to have the conference in the hybrid form, as a move towards normal endemic in-person conferences.For more than a century, social networks have been studied in a variety of disciplines including sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics. The Internet, the social Web, and other large-scale, sociotechnological infrastructures have triggered a growing interest and resulted in significant methodological advancements in social network analysis and mining. Method development in graph theory, statistics, data mining, machine learning, and AI have inspired new research problems and, in turn, opens up further possibilities for application. These spiraling trends have led to a rising prominence of social network analysis and mining methods and tools in academia, politics, security, and business.},

Our approach is based on ontologies represented using a general knowledge base for dynamically building a semantic network. This network is based on linguistic properties and it is combined with our metric to create a measure of semantic relatedness. In this way we obtain an efficient strategy to rank digital documents from the Internet according to the user's interest domain. The proposed methods, metrics, and techniques are implemented in a system for information retrieval on the Web. Experiments are performed on a test set built using a directory service having information about analyzed documents.

abstract = {Social media content is changing the way people interact with each other and share information, personal messages, and opinions about situations, objects, and past experiences. Most social media texts are short online conversational posts or comments that do not contain enough information for natural language processing NLP tools, as they are often accompanied by non-linguistic contextual information, including meta-data e.g., the user's profile, the social network of the user, and their interactions with other users. Exploiting such different types of context and their interactions makes the automatic processing of social media texts a challenging research task. Indeed, simply applying traditional text mining tools is clearly sub-optimal, as, typically, these tools take into account neither the interactive dimension nor the particular nature of this data, which shares properties with both spoken and written language. This special issue contributes to a deeper understanding of the role of these interactions to process social media data from a new perspective in discourse interpretation. This introduction first provides the necessary background to understand what context is from both the linguistic and computational linguistic perspectives, then presents the most recent context-based approaches to NLP for social media. We conclude with an overview of the papers accepted in this special issue, highlighting what we believe are the future directions in processing social media texts.},

abstract = {Document clustering is crucial to automated document management, especially for the fast-growing volume of textual documents available digitally. Traditional lexicon-based approaches depend on document content analysis and measure overlap of the feature vectors representing different documents, which cannot effectively address word mismatch or ambiguity problems. Alternative query expansion and local context discovery approaches are developed but suffer from limited efficiency and effectiveness, because the large number of expanded terms create noise and increase the dimensionality and complexity of the overall feature space. Several techniques extend lexicon-based analysis by incorporating latent semantic indexing but produce less comprehensible clustering results and questionable performance. We instead propose a concept-based document representation and clustering (CDRC) technique and empirically examine its effectiveness using 433 articles concerning information systems and technology, randomly selected from a popular digital library. Our evaluation includes two widely used benchmark techniques and shows that CDRC outperforms them. Overall, our results reveal that clustering documents at an ontology-based, concept-based level is more effective than techniques using lexicon-based document features and can generate more comprehensible clustering results.},

abstract = {Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) have become crucial emerging research topics in the field of RSs, thanks to their natural advantages of explicitly acquiring user preferences via interactive conversations and revealing the reasons behind recommendations. However, the majority of current CRSs are text-based, which is less user-friendly and may pose challenges for certain users, such as those with visual impairments or limited writing and reading abilities. Therefore,for the first time, this paper investigates the potential of voice-based CRS (VCRSs) to revolutionize the way users interact with RSs in a natural, intuitive, convenient, and accessible fashion. To support such studies, we create two VCRSs benchmark datasets in the e-commerce and movie domains, after realizing the lack of such datasets through an exhaustive literature review. Specifically, we first empirically verify the benefits and necessity of creating such datasets. Thereafter, we convert the user-item interactions to text-based conversations through the ChatGPT-driven prompts for generating diverse and natural templates, and then synthesize the corresponding audios via the text-to-speech model. Meanwhile, a number of strategies are delicately designed to ensure the naturalness and high quality of voice conversations. On this basis, we further explore the potential solutions and point out possible directions to build end-to-end VCRSs by seamlessly extracting and integrating voice-based inputs, thus delivering performance-enhanced, self-explainable, and user-friendly VCRSs. Our study aims to establish the foundation and motivate further pioneering research in the emerging field of VCRSs. This aligns with the principles of explainable AI and AI for social good, viz., utilizing technology's potential to create a fair, sustainable, and just world.

abstract = {Service discovery matchmaking plays a vital role in the cyber marketplace for the Internet of Things (IoT), especially in peer-to-peer environments where buyers and sellers dynamically register and match resource profiles online. As the IoT marketplace expands, efficient resource allocation through matchmaking is increasingly important. However, the growing complexity of service discovery, coupled with data security and privacy challenges, complicates the identification of suitable services. To address these issues, this study conducts a comprehensive review of matchmaking algorithms within the IoT marketplace by examining their key attributes, strengths, and limitations as documented in academic literature. This paper categorizes and summarizes state-of-the-art approaches, identifying research gaps and proposing future directions. Our comparative analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of current methodologies, advocating for deep learning and context-aware solutions to improve service efficiency. Additionally, blockchain-based approaches are discussed for their potential to improve security, trust, and privacy-preserving transactions. This research lays a critical foundation for the advancement of secure, efficient IoT-enabled marketplaces.},

This task has been introduced at the TREC Knowledge Base Acceleration track in 2012, where two main families of approaches emerged: classification and ranking. In this paper we perform an experimental comparison of these two strategies using supervised learning with a rich feature set. Our main finding is that ranking outperforms classification on all evaluation settings and metrics. Our analysis also reveals that a ranking-based approach has more potential for future improvements.},

abstract = {Most state-of-the-art deep networks proposed for biomedical image segmentation are developed based on U-Net. While remarkable success has been achieved, its inherent limitations hinder it from yielding more precise segmentation. First, its receptive field is limited due to the fixed kernel size, which prevents the network from modeling global context information. Second, when spatial information captured by shallower layer is directly transmitted to higher layers by skip connections, the process inevitably introduces noise and irrelevant information to feature maps and blurs their semantic meanings. In this article, we propose a novel segmentation network equipped with a new context prior guidance (CPG) module to overcome these limitations for biomedical image segmentation, namely context prior guidance network (CPG-Net). Specifically, we first extract a set of context priors under the supervision of a coarse segmentation and then employ these context priors to model the global context information and bridge the spatial-semantic gap between high-level features and low-level features. The CPG module contains two major components: context prior representation (CPR) and semantic complement flow (SCF). CPR is used to extract pixels belonging to the same objects and hence produce more discriminative features to distinguish different objects. We further introduce deep semantic information for each CPR by the SCF mechanism to compensate the semantic information diluted during the decoding. We extensively evaluate the proposed CPG-Net on three famous biomedical image segmentation tasks with diverse imaging modalities and semantic environments. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our network, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art segmentation networks in all the three tasks. Codes are available at .},

abstract = {The unprecedented amounts of data have catalyzed the trend of combining human insights with machine learning techniques, which facilitate the use of crowdsourcing to enlist label information both effectively and efficiently. One crucial challenge in crowdsourcing is the diverse worker quality, which determines the accuracy of the label information provided by such workers. Motivated by the observations that same set of tasks are typically labeled by the same set of workers, we studied their behaviors across multiple related tasks and proposed an optimization framework for learning from task and worker dual heterogeneity. The proposed method uses a weight tensor to represent the workers’ behaviors across multiple tasks, and seeks to find the optimal solution of the tensor by exploiting its structured information. Then, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve the optimization problem and analyze its computational complexity. To infer the true label of an example, we construct a worker ensemble based on the estimated tensor, whose decisions will be weighted using a set of entropy weight. We also prove that the gradient of the most time-consuming updating block is separable with respect to the workers, which leads to a randomized algorithm with faster speed. Moreover, we extend the learning framework to accommodate to the multi-class setting. Finally, we test the performance of our framework on several datasets, and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art techniques.},

This paper explores how to explain call recommendations to nursing home staff, providing insights into call priority, notifications, and resident information. We present the design and implementation of a recommender engine and a mobile application designed to support call recommendations and explain these recommendations that may contribute to residents’ safety and quality of care. More specifically, we report on the results of a user-centered design approach with residents (N=12) and healthcare professionals (N=4), and a final evaluation (N=12) after four months of deployment. The results show that our design approach provides a valuable tool for more accurate and efficient decision-making. The overall system encourages nursing home staff to provide feedback and annotate, resulting in more confidence in the system. We discuss usability issues, challenges, and reflections to be considered in future health recommender systems.},

abstract = {By means of tagging in social bookmarking applications, so called folksonomies emerge collaboratively. Folksonomies have shown to contain information that is beneficial for resource recommendation. However, as folksonomies are not designed to support recommendation tasks, there are drawbacks of the various recommendation techniques. Graph-based recommendation in folksonomies for example suffers from the problem of concept drift. Vector space based recommendation approaches in folksonomies suffer from sparseness of available data. In this paper, we propose the flexible framework VSScore which incorporates context-specific information into the recommendation process to tackle these issues. Additionally, as an alternative to the evaluation methodology LeavePostOut we propose an adaptation LeaveRTOut for resource recommendation in folksonomies. In a subset of resource recommendation tasks evaluated, the proposed recommendation framework VSScore performs significantly more effective than the baseline algorithm FolkRank.},

abstract = {In recent years, uplift modeling, also known as individual treatment effect (ITE) estimation, has seen wide applications in online marketing, such as delivering one-time issuance of coupons or discounts to motivate users' purchases. However, complex yet more realistic scenarios involving multiple interventions over time on users are still rarely explored. The challenges include handling the bias from time-varying confounders, determining optimal treatment timing, and selecting among numerous treatments. In this paper, to tackle the aforementioned challenges, we present a temporal point process-based uplift model (TPPUM) that utilizes users' temporal event sequences to estimate treatment effects via counterfactual analysis and temporal point processes. In this model, marketing actions are considered as treatments, user purchases as outcome events, and how treatments alter the future conditional intensity function of generating outcome events as the uplift. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines on both real-world and synthetic datasets. In the online experiment conducted in a discounted bundle recommendation scenario involving an average of 3 to 4 interventions per day and hundreds of treatment candidates, we demonstrate how our model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in selecting the appropriate treatment and timing of treatment, resulting in a 3.6% increase in application-level revenue.},

abstract = {The rate of depression in college students is rising, which is known to increase suicide risk, lower academic performance and double the likelihood of dropping out of school. Existing work on finding relationships between passively sensed behavior and depression, as well as detecting depression, mainly derives relevant unimodal features from a single sensor. However, co-occurrence of values in multiple sensors may provide better features, because such features can describe behavior in context. We present a new method to extract contextually filtered features from passively collected, time-series mobile data via association rule mining. After calculating traditional unimodal features from the data, we extract rules that relate unimodal features to each other using association rule mining. We extract rules from each class separately (e.g., depression vs. non-depression). We introduce a new metric to select a subset of rules that distinguish between the two classes. From these rules, which capture the relationship between multiple unimodal features, we automatically extract contextually filtered features. These features are then fed into a traditional machine learning pipeline to detect the class of interest (in our case, depression), defined by whether a student has a high BDI-II score at the end of the semester. The behavior rules generated by our methods are highly interpretable representations of differences between classes. Our best model uses contextually-filtered features to significantly outperform a standard model that uses only unimodal features, by an average of 9.7% across a variety of metrics. We further verified the generalizability of our approach on a second dataset, and achieved very similar results.},

abstract = {Modern social media’s development has dramatically changed how people obtain information. However, the wide dissemination of various false information has severe detrimental effects. Accordingly, many deep learning-based methods have been proposed to detect false information and achieve promising results. However, these methods are unsuitable for new events due to the extremely limited labeled data and their discrepant data distribution to existing events. Domain adaptation methods have been proposed to mitigate these problems. However, their performance is suboptimal because they are not sensitive to new events due to they aim to align the domain information between existing events, and they hardly capture the fine-grained difference between real and fake claims by only using semantic information. Therefore, we propose a novel Emotion-aware Meta Learning (EML) approach for cross-event false information early detection, which deeply integrates emotions in meta learning to find event-sensitive initialization parameters that quickly adapt to new events. EML is non-trivial and faces three challenges: (1) How to effectively model semantic and emotional features to capture fine-grained differences? (2) How to reduce the impact of noise in meta learning based on semantic and emotional features? (3) How to detect the false information in a zero-shot detection scenario, i.e., no labeled data for new events? To tackle these challenges, firstly, we construct the emotion-aware meta tasks by selecting claims with similar and opposite emotions to the target claim other than usually used random sampling. Secondly, we propose a task weighting method and event-adaptation meta tasks to further improve the model’s robustness and generalization ability for detecting new events. Finally, we propose a weak label annotation method to extend EML to zero-shot detection according to the calculated labels’ confidence. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the EML achieves superior performances on false information detection for new events.},

If this prediction is to come true, then next generation computing, which we will call human computing, should be about anticipatory user interfaces that should be human-centered, built for humans based on human models. They should transcend the traditional keyboard and mouse to include natural, human-like interactive functions including understanding and emulating certain human behaviors such as affective and social signaling. This article discusses a number of components of human behavior, how they might be integrated into computers, and how far we are from realizing the front end of human computing, that is, how far are we from enabling computers to understand human behavior.},

abstract = {Email responses often contain items---such as a file or a hyperlink to an external document---that are attached to or included inline in the body of the message. Analysis of an enterprise email corpus reveals that 35% of the time when users include these items as part of their response, the attachable item is already present in their inbox or sent folder. A modern email client can proactively retrieve relevant attachable items from the user's past emails based on the context of the current conversation, and recommend them for inclusion, to reduce the time and effort involved in composing the response. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised learning framework for recommending attachable items to the user. As email search systems are commonly available, we constrain the recommendation task to formulating effective search queries from the context of the conversations. The query is submitted to an existing IR system to retrieve relevant items for attachment. We also present a novel strategy for generating labels from an email corpus---without the need for manual annotations---that can be used to train and evaluate the query formulation model. In addition, we describe a deep convolutional neural network that demonstrates satisfactory performance on this query formulation task when evaluated on the publicly available Avocado dataset and a proprietary dataset of internal emails obtained through an employee participation program.},

abstract = {Question answering (QA) systems take users' natural language questions and retrieve relevant answers from large repositories of free texts. Despite recent progress in QA research, most work on question answering is still focused on isolated questions. In a real-world information seeking scenario, questions are not asked in isolation, but rather in a coherent manner that involves a sequence of related questions to meet users' information needs. Therefore, to support coherent information seeking, intelligent QA interfaces will inevitably require techniques to support context question answering. To address this problem, this paper investigates approaches to discourse processing of a sequence of coherent questions and their implications on query expansion. In particular, we examine three models for query expansion that are motivated by Centering Theory. Our empirical results indicate that more sophisticated processing based on discourse transitions and centers can significantly improve the performance of document retrieval compared to models that only resolve references.},

abstract = {A growing number of mobile apps are exploiting smartphone sensors to infer user behavior, activity, or context. Inference requires training using labeled ground truth data. Obtaining labeled data for new apps is a "chicken-egg" problem. Without a reasonable amount of labeled data, apps cannot provide any service. But until an app provides useful service it is not worth installing and has no opportunity to collect user data. This paper aims to address this problem. Our intuition is that even though users are different, they exhibit similar patterns on certain sensing dimensions. For instance, different users may walk and drive at different speeds, but certain speeds will indicate driving for all users. These common patterns could be used as "seeds" to model new users through semi-supervised learning. We prototype a technique to automatically extract the commonalities to seed personalized inference models for new users. We evaluate the proposed technique through example apps and real world data.},

With activity recognition having considerably matured, so has the number of challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating activity recognition systems. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive hands-on introduction for newcomers to the field of human activity recognition. It specifically focuses on activity recognition using on-body inertial sensors. We first discuss the key research challenges that human activity recognition shares with general pattern recognition and identify those challenges that are specific to human activity recognition. We then describe the concept of an Activity Recognition Chain (ARC) as a general-purpose framework for designing and evaluating activity recognition systems. We detail each component of the framework, provide references to related research, and introduce the best practice methods developed by the activity recognition research community. We conclude with the educational example problem of recognizing different hand gestures from inertial sensors attached to the upper and lower arm. We illustrate how each component of this framework can be implemented for this specific activity recognition problem and demonstrate how different implementations compare and how they impact overall recognition performance.},

abstract = {Queries issued to a search engine are often under-specified or ambiguous. The user's search context or background may provide information that disambiguates their information need in order to automatically predict and issue a more effective query. The disambiguation can take place at different stages of the retrieval process. For instance, contextual query suggestions may be computed and recommended to users on the result page when appropriate, an approach that does not require modifying the original query's results. Alternatively, the search engine can attempt to provide efficient access to new relevant documents by injecting these documents directly into search results based on the user's context.In this paper, we explore these complementary approaches and how they might be combined. We first develop a general framework for mining context-sensitive query reformulations for query suggestion. We evaluate our context-sensitive suggestions against a state-of-the-art baseline using a click-based metric. The resulting query suggestions generated by our approach outperform the baseline by 13% overall and by 16% on an ambiguous query subset.While the query suggestions generated by our approach have higher quality than the existing baselines, we demonstrate that using them naively for injecting new documents into search results can lead to inferior rankings. To remedy this issue, we develop a classifier that decides when to inject new search results using features based on suggestion quality and user context. We show that our context-sensitive result fusion approach (Corfu) improves retrieval quality for ambiguous queries by up to 2.92%. Our approaches can efficiently scale to massive search logs, enabling a data-driven strategy that benefits from observing how users issue and reformulate queries in different contexts.},

Comprehension of streams of data from deployed sensors in a meaningful way is critical to usability of the sensors. One such comprehension is context and situation which may affect our actions and decisions. Context is deduced from the sensor data using probabilistic methods like maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian probabilities. Possible situations are abstracted using deduced contexts. Event trees, template and rule based methods have been used for deriving situations from contexts. Lattices are constructed using formal concept analysis methods for representation and recognition of situations. When the context information is either noisy or incomplete, set of Implication and Association Rules are derived from the lattice and used for situation recognition. For illustration, Situation of an elderly person living alone in a house, deployed with various sensors is recognized using the above technique.},

By using these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate query-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared.},

Soft shadows are ubiquitous, but remain notoriously difficult to extract and manipulate. We posit that soft shadows can be segmented, and therefore edited, by learning a mapping function for image patches that generates shadow mattes. We validate this premise by removing soft shadows from photographs with only a small amount of user input.Given only broad user brush strokes that indicate the region to be processed, our new supervised regression algorithm automatically unshadows an image, removing the umbra and penumbra. The resulting lit image is frequently perceived as a believable shadow-free version of the scene. We tested the approach on a large set of soft shadow images, and performed a user study that compared our method to the state-of-the-art and to real lit scenes. Our results are more difficult to identify as being altered and are perceived as preferable compared to prior work.},

abstract = {Social recommendation systems leverage the social relations among users to deal with the inherent cold-start problem in user-item interactions. However, previous models only treat the social graph as the static auxiliary to the user-item interaction graph, rather than dig out the hidden essentials and optimize them for better recommendations. Thus, the potential of social influence is still under-explored. In this paper, we will fill this gap by proposing a novel model for social influence learning to derive the essential influence patterns within the user relationships. Our model views the social influence from the perspectives of (1) the diversity of neighborhood's influence on the users, (2) the disentanglement of neighborhood's influence on the users, and (3) the exploration of underlying implicit social influence. To this end, we first employ a novel layerwise graph-enhanced variational autoencoder for the reconstruction of neighborhoods' representations, which aims to learn the pattern of social influence as well as simulate the social profile of each user for overcoming the sparsity issue in social relation data. Meanwhile, we introduce a layerwise graph attentive network for capturing the most influential scope of neighborhood. Finally, we adopt a dual sampling process to generate new social relations for enhancing the social recommendation. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three widely-used benchmark datasets, verifying the superiority of our proposed model compared with the representative approaches.},

abstract = {The smart cities paradigm is being adopted by many nations worldwide to offer smart services to their citizens while optimizing the cost of managing crowded and expanding urban areas. The concept is mainly based on the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure to utilize its sensed data of intelligent, interconnected devices to create value-added novel services. However, the smart cities paradigm is still not fully realized because of several challenges, such as heterogeneity of the devices and standards involved. This paper provides a vision for future smart cities and emphasizes its challenges. Moreover, the paper discusses the current technology trends that have the potential to materialize the vision of future smart cities. The paper also proposes a scalable and extensible architecture to employ smart cities’ current and future trends.},

abstract = {Ad-load balancing is a critical challenge in online advertising systems, particularly in the context of social media platforms, where the goal is to maximize user engagement and revenue while maintaining a satisfactory user experience. This requires the optimization of conflicting objectives, such as user satisfaction and ads revenue. Traditional approaches to ad-load balancing rely on static allocation policies, which fail to adapt to changing user preferences and contextual factors. In this paper, we present an approach that leverages off-policy learning and evaluation from logged bandit feedback. We start by presenting a motivating analysis of the ad-load balancing problem, highlighting the conflicting objectives between user satisfaction and ads revenue. We emphasize the nuances that arise due to user heterogeneity and the dependence on the user's position within a session. Based on this analysis, we define the problem as determining the optimal ad-load for a particular feed fetch. To tackle this problem, we propose an off-policy learning framework that leverages unbiased estimators such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and Doubly Robust (DR) to learn and estimate the policy values using offline collected stochastic data. We present insights from online A/B experiments deployed at scale across over 80 million users generating over 200 million sessions, where we find statistically significant improvements in both user satisfaction metrics and ads revenue for the platform.},

abstract = {We study the competing goals of utility and privacy as they arise when a user shares personal sensor data with apps on a smartphone. On the one hand, there can be value to the user for sharing data in the form of various personalized services and recommendations; on the other hand, there is the risk of revealing behaviors to the app producers that the user would like to keep private. The current approaches to privacy, usually defined in multi-user settings, rely on anonymization to prevent such sensitive behaviors from being traced back to the user---a strategy which does not apply if user identity is already known, as is the case here.Instead of protecting identity, we focus on the more general problem of choosing what data to share, in such a way that certain kinds of inferences---i.e., those indicating the user's sensitive behavior---cannot be drawn. The use of inference functions allows us to establish a terminology to unify prior notions of privacy as special cases of this more general problem. We identify several information disclosure regimes, each corresponding to a specific privacy-utility tradeoff, as well as privacy mechanisms designed to realize these tradeoff points. Finally, we propose ipShield as a privacy-aware framework which uses current user context together with a model of user behavior to quantify an adversary's knowledge regarding a sensitive inference, and obfuscate data accordingly before sharing. We conclude by describing initial work towards realizing this framework.},

Our fellow researchers have proposed various approaches (with over 7,000 publications for Android alone) in this field that essentially contributed to the great success of the current mobile ecosystem. Existing research efforts mainly focus on popular mobile platforms, namely Android and iOS. OpenHarmony, a newly open-sourced mobile platform, has rarely been considered, although it is the one requiring the most attention as OpenHarmony is expected to occupy one-third of the market in China (if not in the world). To fill the gap, we present to the mobile software engineering community a research roadmap for encouraging our fellow researchers to contribute promising approaches to OpenHarmony. Specifically, we start by presenting a tertiary study of mobile software engineering, attempting to understand what problems have been targeted by the mobile community and how they have been resolved. We then summarize the existing (limited) achievements of OpenHarmony and subsequently highlight the research gap between Android/iOS and OpenHarmony. This research gap eventually helps in forming the roadmap for conducting software engineering research for OpenHarmony.},

abstract = {Many of today's mobile products and services engage their users proactively via push notifications. However, such notifications are not always delivered at the right moment, therefore not meeting products' and users' expectations. To address this challenge, we aim at developing an intelligent mobile system that automatically infers moments in which users are open to engage with suggested content. To inform the development of such a system, we carried out a field study with 337 mobile phone users. For 4 weeks, participants ran a study application on their primary phones. They were tasked to frequently report their current mood via a notification-administered experience-sampling questionnaire. In this study, however, we analyze whether they voluntarily engaged with content that we offered at the bottom of that questionnaire. In addition, the study app logged a wide range of data related to their phone use. Based on 120 Million phone-use events and 78,930 questionnaire notifications, we build a machine-learning model that before delivering a notification predicts whether a participant will click on the notification and subsequently engage with the offered content. When compared to a na\"{\i}ve baseline, which emulates current non-intelligent engagement strategies, our model achieves 66.6% higher success rate in its predictions. If the model also considers the user's past behavior, predictions improve 5-fold over the baseline. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for building an intelligent service that identifies opportune moments for proactive user engagement, while, at the same time, reduces the number of undesirable interruptions.},

abstract = {As the Internet grows explosively, search engines play a more and more important role for users in effectively accessing online information. Recently, it has been recognized that a query is often triggered by a search task that the user wants to accomplish. Similarly, many web pages are specifically designed to help accomplish a certain task. Therefore, learning hidden tasks behind queries and web pages can help search engines return the most useful web pages to users by task matching. For instance, the search task that triggers query "thinkpad T410 broken" is to maintain a computer, and it is desirable for a search engine to return the Lenovo troubleshooting page on the top of the list. However, existing search engine technologies mainly focus on topic detection or relevance ranking, which are not able to predict the task that triggers a query and the task a web page can accomplish.In this paper, we propose to simultaneously classify queries and web pages into the popular search tasks by exploiting their content together with click-through logs. Specifically, we construct a taskoriented heterogeneous graph among queries and web pages. Each pair of objects in the graph are linked together as long as they potentially share similar search tasks. A novel graph-based regularization algorithm is designed for search task prediction by leveraging the graph. Extensive experiments in real search log data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over state-of-the-art classifiers, and the search performance can be significantly improved by using the task prediction results as additional information.},

In this paper, we address the problem of advice-revealing text unit (ATU) extraction from online forums due to its usefulness in travel domain. We represent advice as a two-tuple comprising an advice-revealing sentence and its context sentences. To extract the advice-revealing sentences, we propose to define the task as a sequence labeling problem, using three different types of features: syntactic, contextual, and semantic features. To extract the context sentences, we propose to use a 2 Dimensional CRF (2D-CRF) model, which gives the best performance compared to traditional machine learning models. Finally, we present a solution to the integrated problem of extracting both advice-revealing sentences and their respective context sentences at the same time using our proposed models, i.e., Multiple Linear CRF (ML-CRF) and 2 Dimensional CRF Plus (2D-CRF+). The experimental results show that ML-CRF performs better than any other models studied in this paper for extracting advice-revealing sentences and context sentences.},

abstract = {Multi-touch attribution (MTA), aiming to estimate the contribution of each advertisement touchpoint in conversion journeys, is essential for budget allocation and automatically advertising. Existing methods first train a model to predict the conversion probability of the advertisement journeys with historical data and calculate the attribution of each touchpoint by using the results counterfactual predictions. An assumption of these works is the conversion prediction model is unbiased. It can give accurate predictions on any randomly assigned journey, including both the factual and counterfactual ones. Nevertheless, this assumption does not always hold as the user preferences act as the common cause for both ad generation and user conversion, involving the confounding bias and leading to an out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in the counterfactual prediction. In this paper, we define the causal MTA task and propose CausalMTA to solve this problem. It systemically eliminates the confounding bias from both static and dynamic perspectives and learn an unbiased conversion prediction model using historical data. We also provide a theoretical analysis to prove the effectiveness of CausalMTA with sufficient ad journeys. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real data in Alibaba advertising platform show that CausalMTA can not only achieve better prediction performance than the state-of-the-art method but also generate meaningful attribution credits across different advertising channels.},

This system includes an event correlator and a risk and trust analysis engine to perform the decision process. MUSES follows a set of defined security rules, according to the enterprise security policies, but it is able to self-adapt the decisions and even create new security rules depending on the user behaviour, the specific device, and the situation or context. To this aim MUSES applies machine learning and computational intelligence techniques which can also be used to predict potential unsafe or dangerous user's behaviour.},

In this paper we present a state-of-the-art baseline semantic role labeling system based on Support Vector Machine classifiers. We show improvements on this system by: i) adding new features including features extracted from dependency parses, ii) performing feature selection and calibration and iii) combining parses obtained from semantic parsers trained using different syntactic views. Error analysis of the baseline system showed that approximately half of the argument identification errors resulted from parse errors in which there was no syntactic constituent that aligned with the correct argument. In order to address this problem, we combined semantic parses from a Minipar syntactic parse and from a chunked syntactic representation with our original baseline system which was based on Charniak parses. All of the reported techniques resulted in performance improvements.},

These systems strive to optimize the match between recommended items and users' preferences. We assume that recommendations might be reflected with low accuracy not only due to the recommended items' suitability to the user, but also because of the recommendations' timings. We therefore claim that it is possible to learn a model of good and bad contexts for recommendations that can later be integrated in a recommender system. Using mobile data collected during a three week user study, we suggest a two-phase model that is able to classify whether a certain context is at all suitable for any recommendation, regardless of its content. Results reveal that a hybrid model that first decides whether it should use a personal or a non-personal timing model, and then classifies accordingly whether the timing is proper for recommendations, is superior to both the personal or non-personal timing models.},

abstract = {Online advertisement is a significant element of the Web browsing experience. A good advertising can not only bring benefits to publisher but also improve user satisfaction and extends advertiser's product marketing. To satisfy the desire of all three parties, the click through rate (CTR) prediction of a user to a specified ad in a specific context is of great importance. This challenging problem plays a key role in online advertising system and has to deal with several hard issues. Firstly, the model must process very high dimensional features from frequently changing ad, user and context, most of which are category features having large cardinality and sparse nature extending the dimensionality by two orders of magnitude. Secondly, nonlinear features such as conjunction information must be integrated into the model for a better prediction accuracy. Finally, the model must be able to parallelized efficiently to train from very large scale data sets. To address these problems, we proposed a novel model called Coupled Logistic Regression (CLR), for accurate and efficient CTR prediction. CLR can exploit all features from ad, user, context and nonlinear features among them by seamlessly integrate the conjunction information by employing factorization machine to achieve precise prediction result. And the high-dimensional problem is avoided by decomposing the decision function into two sub ones. Scalability of CLR is ensured through a newly invited MapReduce parallelization strategy, which can reduce communication and waiting time between nodes. Experimental results on real-world data set show that our CLR model can guarantee both accuracy and efficiency on large scale CTR prediction problems.},

abstract = {Many real-world problems, such as web image analysis, document categorization and product recommendation, often exhibit dual-heterogeneity: heterogeneous features obtained in multiple views, and multiple tasks might be related to each other through one or more shared views. To address these Multi-Task Multi-View (MTMV) problems, we propose a tensor-based framework for learning the predictive multilinear structure from the full-order feature interactions within the heterogeneous data. The usage of tensor structure is to strengthen and capture the complex relationships between multiple tasks with multiple views. We further develop efficient multilinear factorization machines (MFMs) that can learn the task-specific feature map and the task-view shared multilinear structures, without physically building the tensor. In the proposed method, a joint factorization is applied to the full-order interactions such that the consensus representation can be learned. In this manner, it can deal with the partially incomplete data without difficulty as the learning procedure does not simply rely on any particular view. Furthermore, the complexity of MFMs is linear in the number of parameters, which makes MFMs suitable to large-scale real-world problems. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in a wide variety of MTMV problems.},

abstract = {The field of multimedia is unique in offering a rich and dynamic forum for researchers from "traditional" fields to collaborate and develop new solutions and knowledge that transcend the boundaries of individual disciplines. Despite the prolific research activities and outcomes, however, few efforts have been made to develop books that serve as an introduction to the rich spectrum of topics covered by this broad field. A few books are available that either focus on specific subfields or basic background in multimedia. Tutorial-style materials covering the active topics being pursued by the leading researchers at frontiers of the field are currently lacking. In 2015, ACM SIGMM, the special interest group on multimedia, launched a new initiative to address this void by selecting and inviting 12 rising-star speakers from different subfields of multimedia research to deliver plenary tutorial-style talks at the ACM Multimedia conference for 2015. Each speaker discussed the challenges and state-of-the-art developments of their prospective research areas in a general manner to the broad community. The covered topics were comprehensive, including multimedia content understanding, multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction, multimedia social media, and multimedia system architecture and deployment.  Following the very positive responses to these talks, the speakers were invited to expand the content covered in their talks into chapters that can be used as reference material for researchers, students, and practitioners. Each chapter discusses the problems, technical challenges, state-of-the-art approaches and performances, open issues, and promising direction for future work. Collectively, the chapters provide an excellent sampling of major topics addressed by the community as a whole. This book, capturing some of the outcomes of such efforts, is well positioned to fill the aforementioned needs in providing tutorial-style reference materials for frontier topics in multimedia.}

abstract = {Data streams can capture the situation which an actor is experiencing. Knowledge of the present situation is highly beneficial for a wide range of applications. An algorithm called pcStream can be used to extract situations from a numerical data stream in an unsupervised manner. Although pcStream outperforms other stream clustering algorithms at this task, pcStream has two major flaws. The first is its complexity due to continuously performing principal component analysis (PCA). The second is its difficulty in detecting emerging situations whose distributions overlap in the same feature space.In this paper we introduce pcStream2, a variant of pcStream which employs windowing and persistence in order to distinguish between emerging overlapping concepts. We also propose the use of incremental PCA (IPCA) to reduce the overall complexity and memory requirements of the algorithm. Although any IPCA algorithm can be used, we use a novel IPCA algorithm called Just-In-Time PCA which is better suited for processing streams. JIT-PCA makes intelligent 'short cuts' in order to reduce computations. We provide experimental results on real-world datasets that demonstrates how the proposed improvements make pcStream2 a more accurate and practical tool for situation space mining.},

This year's conference is particularly special, as it marks the first time CSCW to be held in Latin America - a highly anticipated milestone for our Latin American community. We are excited to gather in San Jose, Costa Rica, and host a hybrid event that allows remote participation from community members worldwide.As in previous years, CSCW 2024 brings together a variety of disciplines, from system design to critical analysis, to propose, examine, and reimagine technologies that support groups and communities. As our discipline evolves, new topics continuously emerge and are embraced by our community. This year, we see an emphasis on issues centered around AI, including explainability, fairness, and AI-human collaboration. At the same time, our long-standing concerns remain well represented, including work on group dynamics and decision-making, social media, inclusive and culturally aware design, co-design with marginalized communities, and the creation of socially responsible tools. This year, we invited 387 PACM-HCI, TSC, and TOCHI papers to be presented alongside a diverse lineup of workshops, posters, demos, SIGs, panels, and the doctoral consortium.

abstract = {Smartphones can capture diverse spatio-temporal data about an individual; including both intermittent self-report, and continuous passive data collection from onboard sensors and applications. The resulting personal data streams can support powerful inference about the user's state, behavior, well-being and environment. However making sense and acting on these multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data streams requires iterative and intensive exploration of the datasets, and development of customized analysis techniques that are appropriate for a particular health domain.Lifestreams is a modular and extensible open-source data analysis stack designed to facilitate the exploration and evaluation of personal data stream sense-making. Lifestreams analysis modules include: feature extraction from raw data; feature selection; pattern and trend inference; and interactive visualization. The system was iteratively designed during a 6-month pilot in which 44 young mothers used an open-source participatory mHealth platform to record both self-report and passive data about their diet, stress and exercise. Feedback as participants and the study coordinator attempted to use the Lifestreams dashboard to make sense of their data collected during this intensive study were critical inputs into the design process. In order to explore the generality and extensibility of Lifestreams pipeline, it was then applied to two additional studies with different datasets, including a continuous stream of audio data, self-report data, and mobile system analytics. In all three studies, Lifestreams' integrated analysis pipeline was able to identify key behaviors and trends in the data that were not otherwise identified by participants.},

In this paper, we conduct an analysis of embedding-based retrieval launched in early 2021 on our social network search engine, and define two main categories of failures introduced by it, integrity and junkiness. The former refers to issues such as hate speech and offensive content that can severely harm user experience, while the latter includes irrelevant results like fuzzy text matching or language mismatches. Efficient methods during model inference are further proposed to resolve the issue, including indexing treatments and targeted user cohort treatments, etc. Though being simple, we show the methods have good offline NDCG and online A/B tests metrics gain in practice. We analyze the reasons for the improvements, pointing out that our methods are only preliminary attempts to this important but challenging problem. We put forward potential future directions to explore.},

abstract = {Deep Learning models are a standard solution for sensor-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR), but their deployment is often limited by labeled data scarcity and models' opacity. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction to mitigate these issues by infusing knowledge about context information into HAR deep learning classifiers. However, existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR require computationally expensive symbolic reasoners during classification, making them less suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices (e.g., mobile devices). Additionally, NeSy approaches for context-aware HAR have never been evaluated on in-the-wild datasets, and their generalization capabilities in real-world scenarios are questionable. In this work, we propose a novel approach based on a semantic loss function that infuses knowledge constraints in the HAR model during the training phase, avoiding symbolic reasoning during classification. Our results on scripted and in-the-wild datasets show the impact of different semantic loss functions in outperforming a purely data-driven model. We also compare our solution with existing NeSy methods and analyze each approach's strengths and weaknesses. Our semantic loss remains the only NeSy solution that can be deployed as a single DNN without the need for symbolic reasoning modules, reaching recognition rates close (and better in some cases) to existing approaches.},

abstract = {Auditeur is a general-purpose, energy-efficient, and context-aware acoustic event detection platform for smartphones. It enables app developers to have their app register for and get notified on a wide variety of acoustic events. Auditeur is backed by a cloud service to store user contributed sound clips and to generate an energy-efficient and context-aware classification plan for the phone. When an acoustic event type has been registered, the smartphone instantiates the necessary acoustic processing modules and wires them together to execute the plan. The phone then captures, processes, and classifies acoustic events locally and efficiently. Our analysis on user-contributed empirical data shows that Auditeur's energy-aware acoustic feature selection algorithm is capable of increasing the device lifetime by 33.4%, sacrificing less than 2% of the maximum achievable accuracy. We implement seven apps with Auditeur, and deploy them in real-world scenarios to demonstrate that Auditeur is versatile, 11.04% - 441.42% less power hungry, and 10.71% - 13.86% more accurate in detecting acoustic events, compared to state-of-the-art techniques. We present a user study to demonstrate that novice programmers can implement the core logic of interesting apps with Auditeur in less than 30 minutes, using only 15 - 20 lines of Java code.},

It links health observations with health knowledge to influence health choices by clinicians for improved health care. Different from conventional CDSSs which focus on diagnosis assistance, the focus of our CDSS is to provide recommendations and healthcare services for chronic disease patients by long term monitoring. To make our CDSS more intelligent, it induces the patients to interact with the system. By continuously learning and digesting patients' experience and knowledge, the knowledge base of our CDSS is self-evolutionary and dynamically enhanced. We mainly develop two modules to achieve the function of social interaction. Firstly, Knowledge Authority Module (KAM) is developed which is capable of manipulating and preprocessing social data. Secondly, to support self-evolutionary and dynamical learning, we designed the rough set based inference engine. Through social interaction, the patients can get continuous relevant medical recommendations from the system, so they can get a chance to improve their health conditions which in turns keeping on their quality of life.},

PerfSig performs fine-grained anomaly detection over various machine data such as system metrics, system logs, and function call traces. We then conduct causal analysis across different machine data using information theory method to pinpoint the root cause function of a performance bug. PerfSig generates bug signatures as the combination of the identified anomaly patterns and root cause functions. We have implemented a prototype of PerfSig and conducted evaluation using 20 real world performance bugs in six commonly used cloud systems. Our experimental results show that PerfSig captures various kinds of fine-grained anomaly patterns from different machine data and successfully identifies the root cause functions through multi-modality causal analysis for 19 out of 20 tested performance bugs.},

However, most businesses today have item ontologies that provide a useful source of content descriptors that can be used to enhance the quality of recommendations generated. In this article, we present a novel approach to integrating user rating vectors with an item ontology to generate recommendations. The approach is novel in measuring similarity between users in that it first derives factors, referred to as impacts, driving the observed user behavior and then uses these factors within the similarity computation. In doing so, a more comprehensive user model is learned that is sensitive to the context of the user visit.An evaluation of our recommendation algorithm was carried out using data from an online retailer of movies with over 94,000 movies, 44,000 actors, and 10,000 directors within the item knowledge base. The evaluation showed a statistically significant improvement in the prediction accuracy over traditional collaborative filtering. Additionally, the algorithm was shown to generate recommendations for visitors that belong to sparse sections of the user space, areas where traditional collaborative filtering would generally fail to generate accurate recommendations.},

Existing recommender systems mostly focus on recommending individual items that users may be interested in, such as the considerable research work on collaborative filtering that directly models the interaction between users and items. In this paper, we target at a practical but less explored recommendation problem named personalized bundle composition, which aims to offer an optimal bundle (i.e., a combination of items) to the target user. To tackle this specific recommendation problem, we formalize it as a combinatorial optimization problem on a set of candidate items and solve it within a neural combinatorial optimization framework.

abstract = {The popularity of smart wrist wearable technology (e.g., smart-watches) has rejuvenated the exploration of dynamic biometric-based authentication techniques that employ sensor data from these devices. Despite the progress demonstrated by the scientific community, research in this area has not successfully transitioned to practice, and we are yet to see a mainstream user-authentication product based on a dynamic biometric such as handwriting/hand gestures captured using commercial wrist wearables. This work undertakes an investigative analysis to further explore why that is the case. We accomplish this by studying the feasibility and practical deployability of handwriting-based authentication techniques in the literature that utilize motion sensors on-board wrist wearables. We conduct this analysis by replicating four state-of-the-art and representative handwriting-based authentication schemes that employ wrist motion data, in order to test their viability in realistic hand-writing/gesture scenarios. By using data collected from actual human subjects in an unconstrained fashion, we comparatively evaluate the performance of these schemes with well-defined usability and security metrics. Our experimental results show that some of the tested schemes perform considerably well in practice, and are promising. However, they do suffer from several practical user-dependent and technique-specific challenges that act as roadblocks towards their wide-scale adoption in mainstream applications.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen great success of large language models (LLMs) in performing many natural language processing tasks with impressive performance, including tasks that directly serve users such as question answering and text summarization. They open up unprecedented opportunities for transforming information retrieval (IR) research and applications. However, concerns such as halluciation undermine their trustworthiness, limiting their actual utility when deployed in real-world applications, especially high-stake applications where trust is vital. How can we both exploit the strengths of LLMs and mitigate any risk caused by their weaknesses when applying LLMs to IR? What are the best opportunities for us to apply LLMs to IR? What are the major challenges that we will need to address in the future to fully exploit such opportunities? Given the anticipated growth of LLMs, what will future information retrieval systems look like? Will LLMs eventually replace an IR system? In this perspective paper, we examine these questions and provide provisional answers to them. We argue that LLMs will not be able to replace search engines, and future LLMs would need to learn how to use a search engine so that they can interact with a search engine on behalf of users. We conclude with a set of promising future research directions in applying LLMs to IR.},

abstract = {Many have speculated that classifying web pages can improve a search engine's ranking of results. Intuitively results should be more relevant when they match the class of a query. We present a simple framework for classification-enhanced ranking that uses clicks in combination with the classification of web pages to derive a class distribution for the query. We then go on to define a variety of features that capture the match between the class distributions of a web page and a query, the ambiguity of a query, and the coverage of a retrieved result relative to a query's set of classes. Experimental results demonstrate that a ranker learned with these features significantly improves ranking over a competitive baseline. Furthermore, our methodology is agnostic with respect to the classification space and can be used to derive query classes for a variety of different taxonomies.},

abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, detecting a faulty device is crucial to guarantee the reliable execution of IoT services. To detect a faulty device, existing schemes trace a series of events among IoT devices within a certain time window, extract correlations among them, and find a faulty device that violates the correlations. However, if a few users share the same IoT environment, since their concurrent activities make non-correlated devices react together in the same time window, the existing schemes fail to detect a faulty device without differentiating the concurrent activities. To correctly detect a faulty device in the multiple concurrent activities, this work proposes a new precise correlation extraction scheme, called PCoExtractor. Instead of using a time window, PCoExtractor continuously traces the events, removes unrelated device statuses that inconsistently react for the same activity, and constructs fine-grained correlations. Moreover, to increase the detection precision, this work newly defines a fine-grained correlation representation that reflects not only sensor values and functionalities of actuators but also their transitions and program states such as contexts. Compared to existing schemes, PCoExtractor detects and identifies 40.06% more faults for 4 IoT services with concurrent activities of 12 users while reducing 80.3% of detection and identification times.},

abstract = {Selecting the optimal recommender via online exploration-exploitation is catching increasing attention where the traditional A/B testing can be slow and costly, and offline evaluations are prone to the bias of history data. Finding the optimal online experiment is nontrivial since both the users and displayed recommendations carry contextual features that are informative to the reward. While the problem can be formalized via the lens of multi-armed bandits, the existing solutions are found less satisfactorily because the general methodologies do not account for the case-specific structures, particularly for the e-commerce recommendation we study. To fill in the gap, we leverage the D-optimal design from the classical statistics literature to achieve the maximum information gain during exploration, and reveal how it fits seamlessly with the modern infrastructure of online inference. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimal designs, we provide semi-synthetic simulation studies with published code and data for reproducibility purposes. We then use our deployment example on Walmart.com to fully illustrate the practical insights and effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

abstract = {Ranking is a fundamental and widely studied problem in scenarios such as search, advertising, and recommendation. However, joint optimization for multi-scenario ranking, which aims to improve the overall performance of several ranking strategies in different scenarios, is rather untouched. Separately optimizing each individual strategy has two limitations. The first one is lack of collaboration between scenarios meaning that each strategy maximizes its own objective but ignores the goals of other strategies, leading to a sub-optimal overall performance. The second limitation is the inability of modeling the correlation between scenarios meaning that independent optimization in one scenario only uses its own user data but ignores the context in other scenarios. In this paper, we formulate multi-scenario ranking as a fully cooperative, partially observable, multi-agent sequential decision problem. We propose a novel model named Multi-Agent Recurrent Deterministic Policy Gradient (MA-RDPG) which has a communication component for passing messages, several private actors (agents) for making actions for ranking, and a centralized critic for evaluating the overall performance of the co-working actors. Each scenario is treated as an agent (actor). Agents collaborate with each other by sharing a global action-value function (the critic) and passing messages that encodes historical information across scenarios. The model is evaluated with online settings on a large E-commerce platform. Results show that the proposed model exhibits significant improvements against baselines in terms of the overall performance.},

abstract = {This article proposes a new approach to dynamically determine the tree span for tree kernel-based semantic relation extraction between named entities. The basic idea is to employ constituent dependency information in keeping the necessary nodes and their head children along the path connecting the two entities in the syntactic parse tree, while removing the noisy information from the tree, eventually leading to a dynamic syntactic parse tree. This article also explores various entity features and their possible combinations via a unified syntactic and semantic tree framework, which integrates both structural syntactic parse information and entity-related semantic information. Evaluation on the ACE RDC 2004 English and 2005 Chinese benchmark corpora shows that our dynamic syntactic parse tree much outperforms all previous tree spans, indicating its effectiveness in well representing the structural nature of relation instances while removing redundant information. Moreover, the unified parse and semantic tree significantly outperforms the single syntactic parse tree, largely due to the remarkable contributions from entity-related semantic features such as its type, subtype, mention-level as well as their bi-gram combinations. Finally, the best performance so far in semantic relation extraction is achieved via a composite kernel, which combines this tree kernel with a linear, state-of-the-art, feature-based kernel.},

Methods for time series classification like the Hidden Markov Models have been employed in the past for similar tasks, however in many challenging cases they fail, since some behaviors are much more difficult to model than others. This happens particularly in cases that there is scarcity of labelled data.In this paper we introduce a novel re-adjustment framework of behavior recognition and classification by allowing the user incorporation in the learning process.The proposed Evaluative Rectification approach aims at dynamically correcting erroneous classification results to enhance the behavior modeling and therefore the overall classification rates. We evaluate the performance of the examined approach in a challenging real-life industrial environment of an automobile manufacturer. Our experiments indicate a significant outperformance of the proposed Evaluative Rectification scheme compared with traditional classification frameworks, such as Hidden Markov Models.},

Following the great success of the very first SIGIR-AP held in Beijing in November 2023, we have worked very hard with our organising team over a year so that SIGIR-AP 2024 will live up to its high expectations.As noted in the SIGIR-AP Charter and Bylaws, SIGIR-AP cares about sustainability, and is fully hybrid so that participants may choose to enjoy the conference online to avoid taking earth-unfriendly longdistance flights. Moreover, we are experimenting with a few novel approaches to running a sustainable conference, thanks to the generous support from the Tokyo Convention and Visitors Bureau: we will provide sustainable seafood lunch boxes, as well as a conference bag and a mug that are made from recycled plastic! In addition, a substantial portion of the banquet dishes will be vegetarian, which is known to be better for the environment than meat dishes (See Greta Thunberg: The Climate Book, p.249, Penguin Press, 2023).The SIGIR-AP 2024 features two keynotes from Japan: one by Dr. Momoe Makino (Institute of Developing Economies Japan External Trade Organization), titled Information Experiment: What Does Empirical Microeconomics Tell Us? and the other by Professor Sadao Kurohashi (National Institute of Informatics) titled From Data Platforms to Knowledge Infrastructure. We thank Dr. Makino and Professor Kurohashi for boosting the brilliance of our conference program.},

abstract = {In recent years, predicting mobile app usage has become increasingly important for areas like app recommendation, user behaviour analysis, and mobile resource management. Existing models, however, struggle with the heterogeneous nature of contextual data and the user cold start problem. This study introduces a novel prediction model, Mobile App Prediction Leveraging Large Language Model Embeddings (MAPLE), which employs Large Language Models (LLMs) and installed app similarity to overcome these challenges. MAPLE utilises the power of LLMs to process contextual data and discern intricate relationships within it effectively. Additionally, we explore the use of installed app similarity to address the cold start problem, facilitating the modelling of user preferences and habits, even for new users with limited historical data. In essence, our research presents MAPLE as a novel, potent, and practical approach to app usage prediction, making significant strides in resolving issues faced by existing models. MAPLE stands out as a comprehensive and effective solution, setting a new benchmark for more precise and personalised app usage predictions. In tests on two real-world datasets, MAPLE surpasses contemporary models in both standard and cold start scenarios. These outcomes validate MAPLE's capacity for precise app usage predictions and its resilience against the cold start problem. This enhanced performance stems from the model's proficiency in capturing complex temporal patterns and leveraging contextual information. As a result, MAPLE can potentially improve personalised mobile app usage predictions and user experiences markedly.},

abstract = {Contextual bandit algorithms have become popular for online recommendation systems such as Digg, Yahoo! Buzz, and news recommendation in general. Offline evaluation of the effectiveness of new algorithms in these applications is critical for protecting online user experiences but very challenging due to their "partial-label" nature. Common practice is to create a simulator which simulates the online environment for the problem at hand and then run an algorithm against this simulator. However, creating simulator itself is often difficult and modeling bias is usually unavoidably introduced. In this paper, we introduce a replay methodology for contextual bandit algorithm evaluation. Different from simulator-based approaches, our method is completely data-driven and very easy to adapt to different applications. More importantly, our method can provide provably unbiased evaluations. Our empirical results on a large-scale news article recommendation dataset collected from Yahoo! Front Page conform well with our theoretical results. Furthermore, comparisons between our offline replay and online bucket evaluation of several contextual bandit algorithms show accuracy and effectiveness of our offline evaluation method.},

title = {AppContext: differentiating malicious and benign mobile app behaviors using context},
year = {2015},
isbn = {9781479919345},
publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Mobile malware attempts to evade detection during app analysis by mimicking security-sensitive behaviors of benign apps that provide similar functionality (e.g., sending SMS messages), and suppressing their payload to reduce the chance of being observed (e.g., executing only its payload at night). Since current approaches focus their analyses on the types of security-sensitive resources being accessed (e.g., network), these evasive techniques in malware make differentiating between malicious and benign app behaviors a difficult task during app analysis. We propose that the malicious and benign behaviors within apps can be differentiated based on the contexts that trigger security-sensitive behaviors, i.e., the events and conditions that cause the security-sensitive behaviors to occur. In this work, we introduce AppContext, an approach of static program analysis that extracts the contexts of security-sensitive behaviors to assist app analysis in differentiating between malicious and benign behaviors. We implement a prototype of AppContext and evaluate AppContext on 202 malicious apps from various malware datasets, and 633 benign apps from the Google Play Store. AppContext correctly identifies 192 malicious apps with 87.7% precision and 95% recall. Our evaluation results suggest that the maliciousness of a security-sensitive behavior is more closely related to the intention of the behavior (reflected via contexts) than the type of the security-sensitive resources that the behavior accesses.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel hierarchical learning strategy to deal with the data sparseness problem in relation extraction by modeling the commonality among related classes. For each class in the hierarchy either manually predefined or automatically clustered, a linear discriminative function is determined in a top-down way using a perceptron algorithm with the lower-level weight vector derived from the upper-level weight vector. As the upper-level class normally has much more positive training examples than the lower-level class, the corresponding linear discriminative function can be determined more reliably. The upper-level discriminative function then can effectively guide the discriminative function learning in the lower-level, which otherwise might suffer from limited training data. Evaluation on the ACE RDC 2003 corpus shows that the hierarchical strategy much improves the performance by 5.6 and 5.1 in F-measure on least- and medium- frequent relations respectively. It also shows that our system outperforms the previous best-reported system by 2.7 in F-measure on the 24 subtypes using the same feature set.},

abstract = {Tabular data are ubiquitous for the widespread applications of tables and hence have attracted the attention of researchers to extract underlying information. One of the critical problems in mining tabular data is how to understand their inherent semantic structures automatically. Existing studies typically adopt Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to model the spatial information of tabular structures yet ignore more diverse relational information between cells, such as the hierarchical and paratactic relationships. To simultaneously extract spatial and relational information from tables, we propose a novel neural network architecture, TabularNet. The spatial encoder of TabularNet utilizes the row/column-level Pooling and the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) to capture statistical information and local positional correlation, respectively. For relational information, we design a new graph construction method based on the WordNet tree and adopt a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based encoder that focuses on the hierarchical and paratactic relationships between cells. Our neural network architecture can be a unified neural backbone for different understanding tasks and utilized in a multitask scenario. We conduct extensive experiments on three classification tasks with two real-world spreadsheet data sets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed TabularNet over state-of-the-art baselines.},

abstract = {Brain circuit functioning and connectivity between specific regions allow us to learn, remember, recognize and think as humans. In this paper, we ask the question if mobile sensing from phones can predict brain functional connectivity. We study the brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the amygdala, which has been shown by neuroscientists to be associated with mental illness such as anxiety and depression. We discuss initial results and insights from the NeuroSence study, an exploratory study of 105 first year college students using neuroimaging and mobile sensing across one semester. We observe correlations between several behavioral features from students' mobile phones and connectivity between vmPFC and amygdala, including conversation duration (r=0.365, p&lt;0.001), sleep onset time (r=0.299, p&lt;0.001) and the number of phone unlocks (r=0.253, p=0.029). We use a support vector classifier and 10-fold cross validation and show that we can classify whether students have higher (i.e., stronger) or lower (i.e., weaker) vmPFC-amygdala RSFC purely based on mobile sensing data with an F1 score of 0.793. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to report that resting-state brain functional connectivity can be predicted using passive sensing data from mobile phones.},

In this paper, we propose a novel two-step extraction model, which aims to systematically derive link context of quality as high as anchor text. In the macroscopic analysis step, a systematic web page structure analysis is performed to locate the content cohesive text region and potential relevant header or header like tags. In the microscopic extraction step, an English parser is used to extract the relevant sentence fragments in the text region and the nearest heading text is encompassed if the need arises. Preliminary experimental results proved our approach's effectiveness.},

abstract = {One of the strongest indicators of a mental health crisis is how people interact with each other or express themselves. Hence, social media is an ideal source to extract user-level information about the language used to express personal feelings. In the wake of the ever-increasing mental health crisis in the United States, it is imperative to analyze the general well-being of a population and investigate how their public social media posts can be used to detect different underlying mental health conditions. For that purpose, we propose a study that collects posts from "reddits" related to different mental health topics to detect the type of the post and the nature of the mental health issues that correlate to the post. The task of detecting mental health related issues indicates the mental health conditions connected to the posts. To achieve this, we develop a multi-task learning model that leverages, for each post, both the latent embedding space of words and topics for prediction with a message passing mechanism enabling the sharing of information for related tasks. We train the model through an active learning approach in order to tackle the lack of standardized fine-grained label data for this specific task.},

abstract = {Context-aware recommender systems (CARS) have been demonstrated to be able to enhance recommendations by adapting users' preferences to different contextual situations. In recent years, several CARS algorithms have been developed to incorporated into the recommender systems. For example, differential context modeling (DCM) was modified based on traditional neighborhood collaborative filtering (NBCF), context-aware matrix factorization (CAMF) coupled contextual dependency with the matrix factorization technique (MF), and tensor factorization directly models contexts as additional dimensions in the multi-dimensional space, etc. CAMF works well but it is difficult to interpret the latent features in the algorithm. DCM is good for explanation but it may only work well on data sets with dense contextual ratings. Recently, we successfully incorporate contexts into Sparse LInear Method (SLIM) and develop contextual SLIM (CSLIM) recommendation algorithms which take advantages of both NBCF and MF. CSLIM are demonstrated as more effective and promising context-aware recommenders. In this work, we provide the introduction on the framework of the CSLIM algorithms, present the current state of the research, and discuss our ongoing future work to develop and improve our CSLIM models for context-aware recommendations.},

While EMG has the potential to address a range of hands-free interaction needs, it has yet to be widely accepted outside of prosthetics due to a perceived lack of robustness and intuitiveness. To understand how EMG input systems can be better designed, we sampled the ACM digital library to identify limitations in the approaches taken. Leveraging these works in combination with our research group’s extensive interdisciplinary experience in this field, four themes emerged (1) interaction design, (2) model design, (3) system evaluation, and (4) reproducibility. Using these themes, we provide a step-by-step framework for designing EMG-based input systems to strengthen the foundation on which EMG-based interactions are built. Additionally, we provide a call-to-action for researchers to unlock the hidden potential of EMG as a widely applicable and highly usable input modality.},

abstract = {The proposed PhD project addresses the problem of finding descriptions of diseases or patients' health records that are relevant for a given description of patient's symptoms, also known as medical case retrieval (MCR). Designing an automatic multimodal MCR system applicable to general medical data sets still presents an open research problem, as indicated by the ImageCLEF 2013 MCR challenge, where the best submitted runs achieved only moderate retrieval performance and used purely textual techniques. This project therefore aims at designing a multimodal MCR model that is capable of achieving a substantially better retrieval performance on the ImageCLEF data set than state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, the potential of further improvement by leveraging relevance feedback of medical expert users for long-term learning will be investigated.},

abstract = {Untimely interruptions from our mobile devices may have a significant impact on our work performance, stress and well-being, and in critical situations, such as when driving, can even have fatal consequences. State of the art approaches to inferring interruptiblity of mobile users harness an array of sensors available on our devices. Yet, the energy consumption of these sensors clashes with the need to preserve the most precious of the device's resources - its battery charge. In this work we revisit the sensor-based approach to interruptiblity inference and examine the trade-off between a sensor's energy use and its contribution to interruptiblity modelling. Our findings, based on a two week long field study with 14 users demonstrate that turning on additional sensors indeed improves interruptiblity inference, but at a cost of increased energy consumption. We then propose an interruptiblity management systems that uses the classifier confidence as a knob allowing fine-grain tuning along the trade-off front, thus enabling user- and application- specific energy-optimal interruptiblity management.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new paradigm for interacting with zoomable video. Our interaction technique reduces the number of zooms and pans required by providing recommended viewports to the users, and replaces multiple zoom and pan actions with a simple click on the recommended viewport. The usefulness of our technique is visible in the quality of the recommended viewport, which needs to match the user intention, track movement in the scene, and properly frame the scene in the video. To this end, we propose a hybrid method where content analysis is complimented by the implicit feedback of a community of users in order to recommend viewports. We first compute preliminary sets of recommended viewports by analyzing the content of the video. These viewports allow tracking of moving objects in the scene, and are framed without violating basic aesthetic rules. To improve the relevance of the recommended viewports, we collect viewing statistics as users view a video, and use the viewports they select to reinforce the importance of certain recommendations and penalize others. New recommendations that are not previously recognized by content analysis may also emerge. The resulting recommended viewports converge towards the regions in the video that are relevant to users. A user study involving 70 participants shows that an user interface incorporating with our paradigm leads to more number of zooms, into more informative regions with fewer interactions.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an approach to detect information relevance during decision-making from eye movements in order to enable user interface adaptation. This is a challenging task because gaze behavior varies greatly across individual users and tasks and ground-truth data is difficult to obtain. Thus, prior work has mostly focused on simpler target-search tasks or on establishing general interest, where gaze behavior is less complex. From the literature, we identify six metrics that capture different aspects of the gaze behavior during decision-making and combine them in a voting scheme. We empirically show, that this accounts for the large variations in gaze behavior and out-performs standalone metrics. Importantly, it offers an intuitive way to control the amount of detected information, which is crucial for different UI adaptation schemes to succeed. We show the applicability of our approach by developing a room-search application that changes the visual saliency of content detected as relevant. In an empirical study, we show that it detects up to 97% of relevant elements with respect to user self-reporting, which allows us to meaningfully adapt the interface, as confirmed by participants. Our approach is fast, does not need any explicit user input and can be applied independent of task and user.},

abstract = {Large scale deployment of sensors is essential to practical applications in cyber physical systems. For instance, instrumenting a commercial building for 'smart energy' management requires deployment and operation of thousands of measurement and metering sensors and actuators that direct operation of the HVAC system. Each of these sensors need to be named consistently and constantly calibrated. Doing this process manually is not only time consuming but also error prone given the scale, heterogeneity and complexity of buildings as well as lack of uniform naming schemas. To address this challenge, we propose Zodiac - a framework for automatically classifying, naming and managing sensors based on active learning from sensor metadata. In contrast to prior work, Zodiac requires minimal user input in terms of labelling examples while being more accurate. To evaluate Zodiac, we deploy it across four real buildings on our campus and label the ground truth metadata for all the sensors in these buildings manually. Using a combination of hierarchical clustering and random forest classifiers we show that Zodiac can successfully classify sensors with an average accuracy of 98% with 28% fewer training examples when compared to a regular expression based method.},

In recent years, context-aware matrix factorization (CAMF) has emerged as an extension of the matrix factorization technique that also incorporates contextual conditions. In this paper, we introduce another matrix factorization approach for contextual recommendations, the contextual SLIM (CSLIM) recommendation approach. It is derived from the sparse linear method (SLIM) which was designed for Top-N recommendations in traditional recommender systems. Based on the experimental evaluations over several context-aware data sets, we demonstrate that CLSIM can be an effective approach for context-aware recommendations, in many cases outperforming state-of-the-art CARS algorithms in the Top-N recommendation task.},

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of online review systems, a large volume of user-generated content becomes available to help people make reasonable judgments about the quality of services and products from unknown providers. However, these platforms are frequently abused since fraudulent information can be freely inserted by potentially malicious users without validation. Consequently, online review systems become targets of individual and professional spammers, who insert deceptive reviews by manipulating the rating and/or the content of the reviews.In this work, we propose a review spamming detection scheme based on the deviation between the aspect-specific opinions extracted from individual reviews and the aggregated opinions on the corresponding aspects. In particular, we model the influence on the trustworthiness of the user due to his opinion deviations from the majority in the form of a deviation-based penalty, and integrate this penalty into a three-layer trust propagation framework to iteratively compute the trust scores for users, reviews, and review targets, respectively. The trust scores are effective indicators of spammers, since they reflect the overall deviation of a user from the aggregated aspect-specific opinions across all targets and all aspects. Experiments on the dataset collected from Yelp.com show that the proposed detection scheme based on aspect-specific content-aware trust propagation is able to measure users’ trustworthiness based on opinions expressed in reviews.},

abstract = {A major issue of activity recognition in sensor networks is automatically recognizing a user's high-level goals accurately from low-level sensor data. Traditionally, solutions to this problem involve the use of a location-based sensor model that predicts the physical locations of a user from the sensor data. This sensor model is often trained offline, incurring a large amount of calibration effort. In this article, we address the problem using a goal-based segmentation approach, in which we automatically segment the low-level user traces that are obtained cheaply by collecting the signal sequences as a user moves in wireless environments. From the traces we discover primitive signal segments that can be used for building a probabilistic activity model to recognize goals directly. A major advantage of our algorithm is that it can reduce a significant amount of human effort in calibrating the sensor data while still achieving comparable recognition accuracy. We present our theoretical framework for activity recognition, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach using the data collected in an indoor wireless environment.},

More intelligent applications have advanced features such as peer coordination for the scheduling of a meeting but they have not found wide acceptance in the market due to their complexity and computationally intensive operations.

We propose a multitask learning algorithm addressing both issues. Unlike standard multitask algorithms, which use task protein functions similarity information as a bias to speed up learning, we show that dissimilarity information enforces separation of rare class labels from frequent class labels, and for this reason is better suited for solving unbalanced protein function prediction problems. We support our claim by showing that a multitask extension of the label propagation algorithm empirically works best when the task relatedness information is represented using a dissimilarity matrix as opposed to a similarity matrix. Moreover, the experimental comparison carried out on three model organism shows that our method has a more stable performance in both "protein-centric" and "function-centric" evaluation settings.},

In this paper, we design a novel authentication system for more secure pattern unlocking on smartphones. The basic idea is to utilize various behavior information of the user during pattern unlocking as additional authentication fingerprints, so that even if the pattern password is leaked to an attacker, the system remains safe and protected. To accommodate a variety of user contexts by our system, a context-aware module is proposed to distinguish any of such contexts (e.g., body postures when drawing the pattern) and use it to guide the authentication. Moreover, we design a polyline weighted strategy with overlapping based on the consistency of pattern lock, which analyzes the behavior information of the user during the unlock process in a fine-grained manner and takes an overall consideration the results of different polylines. Based on 14,850 samples collected from 77 participants, we have extensively evaluated the proposed system. The results demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art implicit authentication based pattern lock approaches, and that each key module in our system is effective.},

Wearables are promising (e.g., on wristbands, attached to belts or backpacks) to integrate commercial off-the-shelf gas sensors for personal air pollution sensing. Yet previous research lacks comprehensive investigations on the accuracies of air pollution sensing on wearables. In response, we proposed W-Air, an accurate personal multi-pollutant monitoring platform for wearables. We discovered that human emissions introduce non-linear interference when low-cost gas sensors are integrated into wearables, which is overlooked in existing studies. W-Air adopts a sensor-fusion calibration scheme to recover high-fidelity ambient pollutant concentrations from the human interference. It also leverages a neural network with shared hidden layers to boost calibration parameter training with fewer measurements and utilizes semi-supervised regression for calibration parameter updating with little user intervention. We prototyped W-Air on a wristband with low-cost gas sensors. Evaluations demonstrated that W-Air reports accurate measurements both with and without human interference and is able to automatically learn and adapt to new environments.},

abstract = {This work aims at discovering community structure in rich media social networks through analysis of time-varying, multirelational data. Community structure represents the latent social context of user actions. It has important applications such as search and recommendation. The problem is particularly useful in the enterprise domain, where extracting emergent community structure on enterprise social media can help in forming new collaborative teams, in expertise discovery, and in the long term reorganization of enterprises based on collaboration patterns. There are several unique challenges: (a) In social media, the context of user actions is constantly changing and coevolving; hence the social context contains time-evolving multidimensional relations. (b) The social context is determined by the available system features and is unique in each social media platform; hence the analysis of such data needs to flexibly incorporate various system features. In this article we propose MetaFac (MetaGraph Factorization), a framework that extracts community structures from dynamic, multidimensional social contexts and interactions. Our work has three key contributions: (1) metagraph, a novel relational hypergraph representation for modeling multirelational and multidimensional social data; (2) an efficient multirelational factorization method for community extraction on a given metagraph; (3) an online method to handle time-varying relations through incremental metagraph factorization. Extensive experiments on real-world social data collected from an enterprise and the public Digg social media Web site suggest that our technique is scalable and is able to extract meaningful communities from social media contexts. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework through two prediction tasks: (1) in the enterprise dataset, the task is to predict users’ future interests on tag usage, and (2) in the Digg dataset, the task is to predict users’ future interests in voting and commenting on Digg stories. Our prediction significantly outperforms baseline methods (including aspect model and tensor analysis), indicating the promising direction of using metagraphs for handling time-varying social relational contexts.},

abstract = {Context-aware recommender systems are becoming a popular topic, still, there are many untouched aspects. In this paper, research involving context identification and the concepts related to hybrid and context-aware systems is presented. A conceptual architecture for a context-aware recommender system for movies and TV shows is furthermore introduced. The system consists of a number of processes for context identification and recommendation. Key contextual features are identified and used for the creation of several sets of recommendations, based on the predicted context. The main focus of the research presented here is the identification of context, which in turn is used for recommendation. The results will be evaluated and incorporated into the recommendation engine of movie and TV recommendation website Moviepilot.},

abstract = {Spectrum management in cellular networks is a challenging task that will only increase in difficulty as complexity grows in hardware, configurations, and new access technology (e.g. LTE for IoT devices). Wireless providers need robust and flexible tools to monitor and detect faults and misbehavior in physical spectrum usage, and to deploy them at scale. In this paper, we explore the design of such a system by building deep neural network (DNN) models1 to capture spectrum usage patterns and use them as baselines to detect spectrum usage anomalies resulting from faults and misuse. Using detailed LTE spectrum measurements, we show that the key challenge facing this design is model scalability, i.e. how to train and deploy DNN models at a large number of static and mobile observers located throughout the network. We address this challenge by building context-agnostic models for spectrum usage and applying transfer learning to minimize training time and dataset constraints. The end result is a practical DNN model that can be easily deployed on both mobile and static observers, enabling timely detection of spectrum anomalies across LTE networks.},

Evaluation of the prototype application indicate that a brief training of the application suffices to capture patterns in the user's relevant context that simplify glucose level trends analysis.

Stressors not only adversely affect our physical and mental health but also our relationships with family, friends, and coworkers. In this paper, we present a model to automatically detect stressful conversations using wearable physiological and inertial sensors. We conducted a lab and a field study with cohabiting couples to collect ecologically valid sensor data with temporally-precise labels of stressors. We introduce the concept of stress cycles, i.e., the physiological arousal and recovery, within a stress event. We identify several novel features from stress cycles and show that they exhibit distinguishing patterns during stressful conversations when compared to physiological response due to other stressors. We observe that hand gestures also show a distinct pattern when stress occurs due to stressful conversations. We train and test our model using field data collected from 38 participants. Our model can determine whether a detected stress event is due to a stressful conversation with an F1-score of 0.83, using features obtained from only one stress cycle, facilitating intervention delivery within 3.9 minutes since the start of a stressful conversation.},

abstract = {The number of connected devices and services available across the Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly expanding. In this paper, we present a novel mechanism that improves the ability of mobile clients to dynamically discover potentially unknown IoT services across the IoT's increasingly fragmented protocol landscape. Our approach leverages the detected usage patterns of crowds of mobile users interacting with various IoT services in-situ. We model these usage patterns as a contextual bandit problem that incorporates arbitrarily complex contextual cues, such as device settings, users, environment, activities, etc. We present a modified LinUCB-hybrid algorithm that regulates the exploitation of known services based on contextual cues and makes use of exploration at appropriate times to discover contextually relevant IoT services for mobile users who may not have sufficient prior knowledge. These recommended services can then be used by other middleware platforms, plug-ins or apps to compose new services. We present the overall approach, an operational prototype system and a validation of the system, obtained using two experimental scenarios, which demonstrates promising initial results.},

abstract = {The problem of mobile context recognition targets the identification of semantic meaning of context in a mobile environment. This plays an important role in understanding mobile user behaviors and thus provides the opportunity for the development of better intelligent context-aware services. A key step of context recognition is to model the personalized contextual information of mobile users. Although many studies have been devoted to mobile context modeling, limited efforts have been made on the exploitation of the sequential and dependency characteristics of mobile contextual information. Also, the latent semantics behind mobile context are often ambiguous and poorly understood. Indeed, a promising direction is to incorporate some domain knowledge of common contexts, such as “waiting for a bus” or “having dinner,” by modeling both labeled and unlabeled context data from mobile users because there are often few labeled contexts available in practice. To this end, in this article, we propose a sequence-based semisupervised approach to modeling personalized context for mobile users. Specifically, we first exploit the Bayesian Hidden Markov Model (B-HMM) for modeling context in the form of probabilistic distributions and transitions of raw context data. Also, we propose a sequential model by extending B-HMM with the prior knowledge of contextual features to model context more accurately. Then, to efficiently learn the parameters and initial values of the proposed models, we develop a novel approach for parameter estimation by integrating the Dirichlet Process Mixture (DPM) model and the Mixture Unigram (MU) model. Furthermore, by incorporating both user-labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a semisupervised learning-based algorithm to identify and model the latent semantics of context. Finally, experimental results on real-world data clearly validate both the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches for recognizing personalized context of mobile users.},

abstract = {Mobile devices have become an increasingly ubiquitous part of our everyday life. We use mobile services to perform a broad range of tasks (e.g.,&nbsp;booking travel or conducting remote office work), leading to often lengthy interactions with several distinct apps and services. Existing mobile systems handle mostly simple user needs, where a single app is taken as the unit of interaction. To understand users’ expectations and to provide context-aware services, it is important to model users’ interactions with their performed task in mind. To provide a comprehensive picture of common mobile tasks, we first conduct a small-scale user study to understand annotated mobile tasks in-depth, while we demonstrate that by using a set of features (temporal, similarity, and log sequence), we can identify if a pair of app usage belong to the same task effectively. Secondly, the proposed best task detection model is applied to a large-scale data set of commercial mobile app usage logs to infer characteristics of complex (multi-app) mobile tasks in the wild. By applying an unsupervised learning framework, we discover common mobile task types that span multiple apps based on various extracted characteristics. We observe that users generally perform 17 common tasks with 47 sub-tasks, ranging from “social media browsing” to “dining out” and “family entertainments”. Finally, we demonstrate that we can predict the next complex mobile task that users are likely to perform by leveraging features from the historically inferred mobile tasks and user contexts. Our work facilitates an in-depth understanding of mobile tasks at scale, enabling applications for promoting task-aware services.},

The novelty in this work is that we combined matrix factorisation methods for collaborative filtering with hand-crafted and learnt fashion constraints on combining item features such as colour, formality and patterns. Finally, to better understand where the algorithms are underperforming, we conducted focus groups, which lead to deeper insights into how to use constraints to improve package recommendation in this domain.},

Our investigation of existent approaches to personalisation in context-aware computing found that user preferences are assumed to be static across different context descriptions, whilst in reality some user preferences are transient and vary with the change in context. Furthermore, existent preference models do not give an intuitive interpretation of a preference and lack user expressiveness. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a user preference model and mining framework for a context-aware m-services environment based on an intuitive quantitative preference measure and a strict partial order preference representation. Experimental evaluation of the user preference mining framework in a simulated m-Commerce environment showed that it is very promising. The preference mining algorithms were found to scale well with increases in the volumes of data.},

They first extract traditional audio content features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and then predict user preferences. However, these traditional features, originally not created for music recommendation, cannot capture all relevant information in the audio and thus put a cap on recommendation performance. Using a novel model based on deep belief network and probabilistic graphical model, we unify the two stages into an automated process that simultaneously learns features from audio content and makes personalized recommendations. Compared with existing deep learning based models, our model outperforms them in both the warm-start and cold-start stages without relying on collaborative filtering (CF). We then present an efficient hybrid method to seamlessly integrate the automatically learnt features and CF. Our hybrid method not only significantly improves the performance of CF but also outperforms the traditional feature mbased hybrid method.},

abstract = {In this paper, we advance the state-of-the-art in topic modeling by means of the design and development of a novel (semi-formal) general topic modeling framework. The novel contributions of our solution include: (i) the introduction of new semantically-enhanced data representations for topic modeling based on pooling, and (ii) the proposal of a novel topic extraction strategy - ASToC - that solves the difficulty in representing topics in our semantically-enhanced information space. In our extensive experimentation evaluation, covering 12 datasets and 12 state-of-the-art baselines, totalizing 108 tests, we exceed (with a few ties) in almost 100 cases, with gains of more than 50% against the best baselines (achieving up to 80% against some runner-ups). We provide qualitative and quantitative statistical analyses of why our solutions work so well. Finally, we show that our method is able to improve document representation in automatic text classification.},

abstract = {Introduction. Cyberbullying, as a form of abusive online behavior, although not well-defined, is a repetitive process, i.e., a sequence of harassing messages sent from a bully to a victim over a period of time with the intent to harm the victim. Numerous automated, data-driven approaches have been developed for the automatic classification of cyberbullying instances, with emphasis on classification accuracy. While the importance of highly accurate classifiers is undoubted, a key pitfall of existing cyberbullying detection methods is that (i) they disregard the repetitive nature of the harassing process, and (ii) they work retrospectively (i.e., after a cyberbullying incident has occurred), making it difficult to intervene before an interaction escalates. Motivated by the scarcity of methods to anticipate cyberbullying, we focus on cyberbullying prediction with the goal of reducing the time from detection to intervention. Methods. We formulate the prediction of the number of harassing comments a media session will receive over a period of time as a regularized multi-task regression problem. In our formulation, we consider two settings where (i) the progression of cyberbullying behavior from some time point in the near future to subsequent time points further into the future is modeled given limited knowledge of the recent past, and (ii) increasingly more historical data is accumulated to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation on a real-world dataset from Instagram, the online social media platform with the highest percentage of users reporting experiencing cyberbullying. Results. Intuitively, the larger the number of observed comments in the recent past of a media session, the better the predictive power of our approach. The downside to using more historical data is that decisions must be postponed until more comments are collected. Therefore, the trade-off between accuracy and decision speed is examined. In general, our approach outperforms competing approaches by up to 31.4% and 46.2% in Recall and Mathew correlation coefficient respectively. Discussion. Our approach can be used to effectively prioritize media sessions for increased monitoring as time goes by or for immediate intervention before a conversation escalates. In future work, we plan to incorporate additional features and investigate the generalizability of our approach on other key social networking venues where users frequently become victims of cyberbullying. Beyond cyberbullying prediction, our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide insights on the forecasting performance of multi-task regression as a function of the prediction horizon and the length of available historical data. We thus believe that our work can serve as a reference point on the forecasting performance of multi-task regression both for researchers and practitioners.},

Therefore it is essential to develop effective crawling strategies to prioritize the pages to be indexed. The issue is even more important for topic-specific search engines, where crawlers must make additional decisions based on the relevance of visited pages.  However, it is difficult to evaluate alternative crawling strategies because relevant sets are unknown and the search space is changing.  We propose three different methods to evaluate crawling strategies.  We apply the proposed metrics to compare three topic-driven crawling algorithms based on similarity ranking, link analysis, and adaptive agents.},

abstract = {Mobile sensing is a promising sensing paradigm in the era of Internet of Things IoT that utilizes mobile device sensors to collect sensory data about sensing targets and further applies learning techniques to recognize the sensed targets to correct classes or categories. Due to the recent great success of deep learning, an emerging trend is to adopt deep learning in this recognition process, while we find an overlooked yet crucial issue to be solved in this paper — The size of deep learning models should be sufficiently large for reliably classifying various types of recognition targets, while the achieved processing delay may fail to satisfy the stringent latency requirement from applications. If we blindly shrink the deep learning model for acceleration, the performance cannot be guaranteed. To cope with this challenge, this paper presents a compact deep neural network architecture, namely cDeepArch. The key idea of the cDeepArch design is to decompose the entire recognition task into two lightweight sub-problems: context recognition and the context-oriented target recognitions. This decomposition essentially utilizes the adequate storage to trade for the CPU and memory resource consumptions during execution. In addition, we further formulate the execution latency for decomposed deep learning models and propose a set of enhancement techniques, so that system performance and resource consumption can be quantitatively balanced. We implement a cDeepArch prototype system and conduct extensive experiments. The result shows that cDeepArch achieves excellent recognition performance and the execution latency is also lightweight.},

This year's conference is being held in the beautiful cultural capital of Australia, Melbourne. During the Gold Rush period of the 19th Century, Melbourne was the richest city in the world, and as a result it is filled with many unique neighborhoods and distinctive buildings. In addition to wonderful neighborhoods to explore, the city has great museums and other cultural attractions, as well as a fine multi-cultural atmosphere. For those who would like to explore the outdoors, popular highlights are the Phillip Island Nature Park (90 minutes away), which features wild penguins who return in a parade each day at sunset, and the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's most scenic coastal drives, including the famous towering 12 Apostles.SIGMOD 2015's exciting technical program reflects not only traditional topics, but the database community's role in broader data science and data analytics. The keynote from Laura Haas, "The Power Behind the Throne: Information Integration in the Age of Data-Driven Discovery" highlights the role of database and data integration techniques in the growing field of data science. Jignesh Patel's talk, "From Data to Insights @ Bare Metal Speed," explains how hardware and software need to be co-evolved to support the needs of scalable data analytics. Jennifer Widom, winner of the 2015 ACM-W Athena Lecturer Award for fundamental contributions to computer science, will give her award talk, "Three Favorite Results," on Tuesday. Christopher R\'{e} will lead a panel on "Machine Learning and Databases: The Sound of Things to Come or a Cacophony of Hype?," with participants Divyakant Agrawal, Magdalena Balazinska, Michael Cafarella, Michael Jordan, Tim Kraska, and Raghu Ramakrishnan. Of course, there are also 106 research paper presentations, 4 tutorials, 30 demonstrations, and 18 industrial papers. Papers will be presented both as talks during the research sessions, and as part of plenary Poster Sessions.SIGMOD 2015 is preceded by the PhD Workshop, as well as workshops on leading-edge topics like data analytics (DanaC), databases and the Web (WebDB), exploratory search (ExploreDB), managing and mining spatial data (GeoRich), and graph data (GRADES); the New Researcher Symposium will take place on Wednesday. The banquet will be held in a Melbourne landmark, the Town Hall.As in recent years, we had two submission deadlines for SIGMOD this year, one in August and one in November. The review process was journal-style, with multiple rounds of reviews coordinated by the Group Leaders. We accepted 34 of 137 papers from the first deadline and 72 of 278 from the second deadline. The total acceptance rate was about 25.5%, and we believe that the revision processhas improved the quality of the technical program.},

abstract = {A central theme in learning from image data is to develop appropriate image representations for the specific task at hand. Traditional methods used handcrafted local features combined with high-level image representations to generate image-level representations. Thus, a practical challenge is to determine what features are appropriate for specific tasks. For example, in the study of gene expression patterns in Drosophila melanogaster, texture features based on wavelets were particularly effective for determining the developmental stages from in situ hybridization (ISH) images. Such image representation is however not suitable for controlled vocabulary (CV) term annotation because each CV term is often associated with only a part of an image. Here, we developed problem-independent feature extraction methods to generate hierarchical representations for ISH images. Our approach is based on the deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can act on image pixels directly. To make the extracted features generic, the models were trained using a natural image set with millions of labeled examples. These models were transferred to the ISH image domain and used directly as feature extractors to compute image representations. Furthermore, we employed multi-task learning method to fine-tune the pre-trained models with labeled ISH images, and also extracted features from the fine-tuned models. Experimental results showed that feature representations computed by deep models based on transfer and multi-task learning significantly outperformed other methods for annotating gene expression patterns at different stage ranges. We also demonstrated that the intermediate layers of deep models produced the best gene expression pattern representations.},

abstract = {Collaborative tagging applications allow Internet users to annotate resources with personalized tags. The complex network created by many annotations, often called a folksonomy, permits users the freedom to explore tags, resources or even other user's profiles unbound from a rigid predefined conceptual hierarchy. However, the freedom afforded users comes at a cost: an uncontrolled vocabulary can result in tag redundancy and ambiguity hindering navigation. Data mining techniques, such as clustering, provide a means to remedy these problems by identifying trends and reducing noise. Tag clusters can also be used as the basis for effective personalized recommendation assisting users in navigation. We present a personalization algorithm for recommendation in folksonomies which relies on hierarchical tag clusters. Our basic recommendation framework is independent of the clustering method, but we use a context-dependent variant of hierarchical agglomerative clustering which takes into account the user's current navigation context in cluster selection. We present extensive experimental results on two real world dataset. While the personalization algorithm is successful in both cases, our results suggest that folksonomies encompassing only one topic domain, rather than many topics, present an easier target for recommendation, perhaps because they are more focused and often less sparse. Furthermore, context dependent cluster selection, an integral step in our personalization algorithm, demonstrates more utility for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies than in single-topic folksonomies. This observation suggests that topic selection is an important strategy for recommendation in multi-topic folksonomies.},

abstract = {Continuous audio analysis from embedded and mobile devices is an increasingly important application domain. More and more, appliances like the Amazon Echo, along with smartphones and watches, and even research prototypes seek to perform multiple discriminative tasks simultaneously from ambient audio; for example, monitoring background sound classes (e.g., music or conversation), recognizing certain keywords (‘Hey Siri' or ‘Alexa'), or identifying the user and her emotion from speech. The use of deep learning algorithms typically provides state-of-the-art model performances for such general audio tasks. However, the large computational demands of deep learning models are at odds with the limited processing, energy and memory resources of mobile, embedded and IoT devices.In this paper, we propose and evaluate a novel deep learning modeling and optimization framework that specifically targets this category of embedded audio sensing tasks. Although the supported tasks are simpler than the task of speech recognition, this framework aims at maintaining accuracies in predictions while minimizing the overall processor resource footprint. The proposed model is grounded in multi-task learning principles to train shared deep layers and exploits, as input layer, only statistical summaries of audio filter banks to further lower computations.We find that for embedded audio sensing tasks our framework is able to maintain similar accuracies, which are observed in comparable deep architectures that use single-task learning and typically more complex input layers. Most importantly, on an average, this approach provides almost a 2.1\texttimes{} reduction in runtime, energy, and memory for four separate audio sensing tasks, assuming a variety of task combinations.},

To the best of our knowledge, however, none of these provides information taking into account user preferences, or other elements, in addition to location, that contribute to define the context of use. The provided suggestions do not consider, for example, time, day of week, weather, user activity or means of transport. This article describes a social recommender system able to identify user preferences and information needs, thus suggesting personalized recommendations related to POIs in the surroundings of the user's current location. The proposed approach achieves the following goals: (i) to supply, unlike the current LBSs, a methodology for identifying user preferences and needs to be used in the information filtering process; (ii) to exploit the ever-growing amount of information from social networking, user reviews, and local search Web sites; (iii) to establish procedures for defining the context of use to be employed in the recommendation of POIs with low effort. The flexibility of the architecture is such that our approach can be easily extended to any category of POI. Experimental tests carried out on real users enabled us to quantify the benefits of the proposed approach in terms of performance improvement.},

In the case of images and video, the growth of digital data has been observed since the introduction of 2D capture devices. A similar development is expected for 3D data as acquisition and dissemination technology of 3D models is constantly improving. 3D objects are becoming an important type of multimedia data with many promising application possibilities. Defining the aspects that constitute the similarity among 3D objects and designing algorithms that implement such similarity definitions is a difficult problem. Over the last few years, a strong interest in methods for 3D similarity search has arisen, and a growing number of competing algorithms for content-based retrieval of 3D objects have been proposed. We survey feature-based methods for 3D retrieval, and we propose a taxonomy for these methods. We also present experimental results, comparing the effectiveness of some of the surveyed methods.},

abstract = {The Handbook of Multimodal-Multisensor Interfaces provides the first authoritative resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for new computer interfaces-user input involving new media (speech, multi-touch, gestures, writing) embedded in multimodal-multisensor interfaces. These interfaces support smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle, robotic, and many other applications that are now highly competitive commercially.   This edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the field. It provides a textbook for students, and a reference and technology roadmap for professionals working in this rapidly emerging area.    Volume 1 of the handbook presents relevant theory and neuroscience foundations for guiding the development of high-performance systems. Additional chapters discuss approaches to user modeling, interface design that supports user choice, synergistic combination of modalities with sensors, and blending of multimodal input and output. They also highlight an in-depth look at the most common multimodal-multisensor combinations- for example, touch and pen input, haptic and non-speech audio output, and speech co-processed with visible lip movements, gaze, gestures, or pen input. A common theme throughout is support for mobility and individual differences among users-including the world's rapidly growing population of seniors.    These handbook chapters provide walk-through examples and video illustrations of different system designs and their interactive use. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal-multisensor systems. In the final chapter, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces should be designed in the future to most effectively advance human performance.}

abstract = {Dynamic software product lines demand self-adaptation of their behavior to deal with runtime contextual changes in their environment and offer a personalized product to the user. However, taking user preferences and context into account impedes the manual configuration process, and thus, an efficient and automated procedure is required. To automate the configuration process, context-aware recommendation techniques have been acknowledged as an effective mean to provide suggestions to a user based on their recognized context. In this work, we propose a collaborative filtering method based on tensor factorization that allows an integration of contextual data by modeling an N-dimensional tensor User-Feature-Context instead of the traditional two-dimensional User-Feature matrix. In the proposed approach, different types of non-functional properties are considered as additional contextual dimensions. Moreover, we show how to self-configure software product lines by applying our N-dimensional tensor factorization recommendation approach. We evaluate our approach by means of an empirical study using two datasets of configurations derived for medium-sized product lines. Our results reveal significant improvements in the predictive accuracy of the configuration over a state-of-the-art non-contextual matrix factorization approach. Moreover, it can scale up to a 7-dimensional tensor containing hundred of configurations in a couple of milliseconds.},

We show that the social dimensions depth/importance and formality/goal orientation of a conversation are strong indicators of receptiveness. Furthermore, we find that there are types of conversation, e.g. small talk, in which individuals are even more receptive to notifications than in situations without any verbal social interaction at all. This refutes the assumption currently found in the literature that the occurrence of a conversation is a strong predictor of unavailability. We demonstrate a system that tracks conversations in which the user is engaged and that analyzes speech in terms of embedded affective and social cues. Eventually, we find that information of either kind, derived from audio, improves the accuracy of personal notification preference models substantially.},

abstract = {Advances in biomedical sensors and mobile communication technologies have fostered the rapid growth of mobile health (mHealth) applications in the past years. Users generate a high volume of biomedical data during health monitoring, which can be used by the mHealth server for training predictive models for disease diagnosis and treatment. However, the biomedical sensing data raise serious privacy concerns because they reveal sensitive information such as health status and lifestyles of the sensed subjects. This paper proposes and experimentally studies a scheme that keeps the training samples private while enabling accurate construction of predictive models. We specifically consider logistic regression models which are widely used for predicting dichotomous outcomes in healthcare, and decompose the logistic regression problem into small subproblems over two types of distributed sensing data, i.e., horizontally partitioned data and vertically partitioned data. The subproblems are solved using individual private data, and thus mHealth users can keep their private data locally and only upload (encrypted) intermediate results to the mHealth server for model training. Experimental results based on real datasets show that our scheme is highly efficient and scalable to a large number of mHealth users.},

abstract = {Automated recommendations have become a ubiquitous part of today’s online user experience. These systems point us to additional items to purchase in online shops, they make suggestions to us on movies to watch, or recommend us people to connect with on social websites. In many of today’s applications, however, the only way for users to interact with the system is to inspect the recommended items. Often, no mechanisms are implemented for users to give the system feedback on the recommendations or to explicitly specify preferences, which can limit the potential overall value of the system for its users.Academic research in recommender systems is largely focused on algorithmic approaches for item selection and ranking. Nonetheless, over the years a variety of proposals were made on how to design more interactive recommenders. This work provides a comprehensive overview on the existing literature on user interaction aspects in recommender systems. We cover existing approaches for preference elicitation and result presentation, as well as proposals that consider recommendation as an interactive process. Throughout the work, we furthermore discuss examples of real-world systems and outline possible directions for future works.},

abstract = {User profiling is crucial to many online services. Several recent studies suggest that demographic attributes are predictable from different online behavioral data, such as users' "Likes" on Facebook, friendship relations, and the linguistic characteristics of tweets. But location check-ins, as a bridge of users' offline and online lives, have by and large been overlooked in inferring user profiles. In this paper, we investigate the predictive power of location check-ins for inferring users' demographics and propose a simple yet general location to profile (L2P) framework. More specifically, we extract rich semantics of users' check-ins in terms of spatiality, temporality, and location knowledge, where the location knowledge is enriched with semantics mined from heterogeneous domains including both online customer review sites and social networks. Additionally, tensor factorization is employed to draw out low dimensional representations of users' intrinsic check-in preferences considering the above factors. Meanwhile, the extracted features are used to train predictive models for inferring various demographic attributes.We collect a large dataset consisting of profiles of 159,530 verified users from an online social network. Extensive experimental results based upon this dataset validate that: 1) Location check-ins are diagnostic representations of a variety of demographic attributes, such as gender, age, education background, and marital status; 2) The proposed framework substantially outperforms compared models for profile inference in terms of various evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, F-measure, and AUC.},

abstract = {In recent years, mobile devices have become the most popular interface for users to retrieve and access information: recent reports show that users spend significantly more time and issue more search queries on mobile devices than on desktops in the United States.1 The accelerated growth of mobile usage brings unique opportunities to the information retrieval and data mining research communities.Mobile devices capture rich contextual and personal signals that can be leveraged to accurately predict users’ intent for serving more relevant content and can even proactively provide novel zero-query recommendations. Apple Siri, Google Now, and Microsoft Cortana are recent examples of such emerging systems. Furthermore, mobile devices constantly generate a huge amount of sensor footprints (e.g., GPS, motion sensors) and user activity data (e.g., used apps) that are often missing from their desktop counterparts. These new sources of implicit and explicit user feedback are valuable for discovering actionable knowledge, and designing better systems that serve each individual the right content at the right time and location. In addition, by aggregating mobile interactions across individuals, one can infer interesting conclusions beyond search and recommendation. Generating real-time traffic estimates is one example of such applications.This special issue focuses on research problems of search, mining, and their applications in mobile devices. Topics of interest in this special issue include but are not limited to mobile data mining and management, mobile search, personalization and recommendation, mobile user interfaces and human-computer interaction, and new applications in the mobile environment. The aim of this special issue is to bring together top experts across multiple disciplines, including information retrieval, data mining, mobile computing, and cyberphysical systems, such that academic and industrial researchers can exchange ideas and share the latest developments on the state of the art and practice of mobile search and mobile data mining.},

abstract = {Behavior-based analysis of dynamically executed software has become an established technique to identifying and analyzing potential malware. Most solutions rely on API or system call patterns to determine whether a sample is exhibiting malicious activity. Analysis is usually performed on demand and offers little insight into the current system state. In addition, the fixed nature of behavioral patterns is known to cause false-positives whenever a certain, potentially malicious action is used in a benign context.To combat these shortcomings, this paper proposes an analysis system capable of building event propagation trees from real-time kernel monitoring data. Distance-based anomaly detection is then used to find and highlight activities deviating from a predefined baseline established through heuristic clustering.The system was tested on a set of real-world data collected by a number of host-based agents distributed across a corporate network.},

abstract = {Smoking has been conclusively proved to be the leading cause of mortality that accounts for one in five deaths in the United States. Extensive research is conducted on developing effective smoking cessation programs. Most smoking cessation programs achieve low success rate because they are unable to intervene at the right moment. Identification of high-risk situations that may lead an abstinent smoker to relapse involve discovering the associations among various contexts that precede a smoking session or a smoking lapse. In the absence of an automated method, detection of smoking events still relies on subject self-report that is prone to failure to report and involves subject burden. Automated detection of smoking events in the natural environment can revolutionize smoking research and lead to effective intervention.In this paper, we present mpuff, a novel system to automatically detect smoking puffs from respiration measurements, using which a model can be developed to automatically detect entire smoking episodes in the field. We introduce several new features from respiration that can help classify individual respiration cycles into smoking puffs or non-puffs. We then propose supervised and semi-supervised support vector models to detect smoking puffs. We train our models on data collected from 10 daily smokers and find that smoking puffs can be detected with an accuracy of 91% within a smoking session. We then consider respiration measurements during confounding events such as stress, speaking, and walking, and show that our model can still identify smoking puffs with an accuracy of 86.7%. The smoking detector presented here opens the opportunity to develop effective interventions that can be delivered on a mobile phone when and where smoking urges may occur, thereby improving the abysmal low rate of success in smoking cessation.},

In practice, accomplishing a task on smartphones may require the user to navigate among various apps. Unlike Web pages that are inherently interconnected through hyperlinks, apps are usually isolated building blocks, and the lack of direct links between apps has compromised the efficiency of task completion and user experience. In this article, we present the first in-depth empirical study of page-level access behaviors of smartphone users based on a comprehensive dataset collected through an extensive user study. We propose a model to distinguish informational pages and transitional pages, based on which we can extract page-level inter-app navigation. Surprisingly, the transitional pages account for quite substantial time cost and manual actions when navigating from the current informational page to the desirable informational page. We reveal that developing “tunnels” between “isolated” apps under specific usage scenarios has a huge potential to reduce the cost of navigation. Our analysis provides some practical implications on how to improve app-navigation experience from both the operating system’s perspective and the developer’s&lt;?brk?&gt; perspective.},

The goal is to build a system that is intelligible for users, i.e., not just a "black-box" solution. Rules are shown to users who might decide to accept or discard them at run-time. The design of PrefMiner is based on a large scale mobile notification dataset and its effectiveness is evaluated by means of an in-the-wild deployment.},

The success of such JITIs critically depends on being able to mine the time series of noisy sensor data to find the most opportune moments. In this paper, we propose a time series pattern mining method to detect significant stress episodes in a time series of discontinuous and rapidly varying stress data. We apply our model to 4 weeks of physiological, GPS, and activity data collected from 38 users in their natural environment to discover patterns of stress in real life. We find that the duration of a prior stress episode predicts the duration of the next stress episode and stress in mornings and evenings is lower than during the day. We then analyze the relationship between stress and objectively rated disorder in the surrounding neighborhood and develop a model to predict stressful episodes.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a wearable intelligence device for activity monitoring applications. We developed and evaluated algorithms to recognize physical activities from data acquired using a 3-axis accelerometer with a single camera worn on a body. The recognition process is performed in two steps: at first the features for defining a human activity are measured by the 3-axis accelerometer sensor and the image sensor embedded in a wearable device. Then, the physical activity corresponding to the measured features is determined by applying the SVM classifier. The 3-axis accelerometer sensor computes the correlation between axes and the magnitude of the FFT for other features of an activity. Acceleration data is classified into nine activity labels. Through the image sensor, multiple optical flow vectors computed on each grid image patch are extracted as features for defining an activity. In the experiments, we showed that an overall accuracy rate of activity recognition based our method was 92.78%.},

abstract = {Data gathered from smartphones enables service providers to infer a wide range of personal information about their users, such as their traits, their personality, and their demographics. This personal information can be made available to third parties, such as advertisers, sometimes unbeknownst to the users. Leveraging location information, advertisers can serve ads micro-targeted to users based on the places they visited. Understanding the types of information that can be extracted from location data and implications in terms of user privacy is of critical importance.In this context, we conducted an extensive in-the-wild research study to shed light on the range of personal information that can be inferred from the places visited by users, as well as privacy sensitivity of the personal information. To this end, we developed TrackingAdvisor, a mobile application that continuously collects user location and extracts personal information from it. The app also provides an interface to give feedback about the relevance of the personal information inferred from location data and its corresponding privacy sensitivity. Our findings show that, while some personal information such as social activities is not considered private, other information such as health, religious belief, ethnicity, political opinions, and socio-economic status is considered private by the participants of the study. This study paves the way to the design of privacy-preserving systems that provide contextual recommendations and explanations to help users further protect their privacy by making them aware of the consequences of sharing their personal data.},

However, there is currently no detailed understanding of how well pedometry works when applied to smartphones in typical, unconstrained use.This paper evaluates common walk detection (WD) and step counting (SC) algorithms applied to smartphone sensor data. Using a large dataset (27 people, 130 walks, 6 smartphone placements) optimal algorithm parameters are provided and applied to the data. The results favour the use of standard deviation thresholding (WD) and windowed peak detection (SC) with error rates of less than 3%. Of the six different placements, only the back trouser pocket is found to degrade the step counting performance significantly, resulting in undercounting for many algorithms.},

Based on these models, we developed a dynamic home screen application that presents icons for the most probable apps on the main screen of the phone and highlights the most probable one. Our models outperformed other strategies, and, in particular, improved prediction accuracy by 8% over Most Frequently Used from 79.8% to 87.8% (for 9 candidate apps). Also, we found that the dynamic home screen improved accessibility to apps on the phone, compared to the conventional static home screen in terms of accuracy, required touch input and app selection time.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses interactive technologies in the service of seniors. Adults over 65 form one of the largest and most rapidly growing user groups in the industrialized society. Interactive technologies have been steadily improving in their ability to provide practical support for these users and their daily challenges. These applications range from supporting low-literacy adults with mobile touch and spoken language interfaces [Munteanu et al. 2014], to interactive robotic fitness coaches for seniors [G\"{o}rer et al. 2016]. The goal of this chapter is to present an in-depth analysis of the needs of seniors, as well as to investigate how multimodal and multisensor technologies are used to address these needs.In Section 8.2 of this chapter, we structure the needs of older adults according to a hierarchy of human needs that emphasizes self-actualization [Maslow 1954]. Maslow's theoretical prism helps us to identify a broad spectrum of potential opportunities for researchers and practitioners who design multimodal-multisensor applications. We present a number of example applications in Section 8.3. These examples are illustrative of how interactive technologies, especially ones that leverage multiple modalities (e.g., speech, gestures, touch) and sensor data (e.g., location and accelerometers available on consumer phones) can provide a basis for meeting the needs of older adults. Section 8.4 briefly surveys future directions of multimodal-multisensor research that has potential for developing valuable new 320 Chapter 8 Multimodal Technologies for Seniors: Challenges and Opportunities assistive living technologies.1 Section 8.5 is a discussion of both design and implementation challenges, followed with conclusions in Section 8.6, and a list of supplementary Focus Questions to aid in further understanding of essential content. We hope that this broad overview will encourage both new and established researchers to explore how current or future multimodal and multisensor interfaces can better support one of the largest but most under-represented demographic groups.},

abstract = {We describe our experience building and using a reasoning system for providing context-based prompts to elders to take their medication. We describe the process of specification, design, implementation and use of our system. We chose a simple Dynamic Bayesian Network as our representation. We analyze the design space for the model in some detail. A key challenge in using the model was the overhead of labeling the data. We analyze the impact of a variety of options to ease labeling, and highlight in particular the utility of simple clustering before labeling. A key choice in the design of such reasoning systems is that between statistical and deterministic rule-based approaches. We evaluate a simple rule-based system on our data and discuss some of its pros and cons when compared to the statistical (Bayesian) approach in a practical setting. We discuss challenges to reasoning arising from failures of data collection procedures and calibration drift. The system was deployed among 6 subjects over a period of 12 weeks, and resulted in adherence improving from 56% on average with no prompting to 63% with state of the art context-unaware prompts to 74% with our context-aware prompts.},

abstract = {Sensor convergence on the mobile phone is spawning a broad base of new and interesting mobile applications. As applications grow in sophistication, raw sensor readings often require classification into more useful application-specific high-level data. For example, GPS readings can be classified as running, walking or biking. Unfortunately, traditional classifiers are not built for the challenges of mobile systems: energy, latency, and the dynamics of mobile.Kobe is a tool that aids mobile classifier development. With the help of a SQL-like programming interface, Kobe performs profiling and optimization of classifiers to achieve an optimal energy-latency-accuracy tradeoff. We show through experimentation on five real scenarios, classifiers on Kobe exhibit tight utilization of available resources. For comparable levels of accuracy traditional classifiers, which do not account for resources, suffer between 66% and 176% longer latencies and use between 31% and 330% more energy. From the experience of using Kobe to prototype two new applications, we observe that Kobe enables easier development of mobile sensing and classification apps.},

The information used from Wikipedia includes the titles of articles, co-occurrence of keywords and categories associated with each Wikipedia definition. We compare our methods with three keyword extraction methods used as baselines: (i) all the terms of a web page, (ii) a TF-IDF implementation that extracts single weighted words of a web page and (iii) a previously proposed Wikipedia-based keyword extraction method presented in the literature. We compare our three keyword extraction methods with the baseline methods in three distinct scenarios, all related to our target application, which is the selection of ads in a context-based advertising system. In the first scenario, the target pages to place ads were extracted from Wikipedia articles, whereas the target pages in the other two scenarios were extracted from a news web site. Experimental results show that our methods are quite competitive solutions for the task of selecting good keywords to represent target web pages, albeit being simple, effective and time efficient. For instance, in the first scenario our best method used to extract keywords from Wikipedia articles achieved an improvement of 33% when compared to the second best baseline, and a gain of 26% when considering all the terms.},

abstract = {When you write papers, how many times do you want to make some citations at a place but you are not sure which papers to cite? Do you wish to have a recommendation system which can recommend a small number of good candidates for every place that you want to make some citations? In this paper, we present our initiative of building a context-aware citation recommendation system. High quality citation recommendation is challenging: not only should the citations recommended be relevant to the paper under composition, but also should match the local contexts of the places citations are made. Moreover, it is far from trivial to model how the topic of the whole paper and the contexts of the citation places should affect the selection and ranking of citations. To tackle the problem, we develop a context-aware approach. The core idea is to design a novel non-parametric probabilistic model which can measure the context-based relevance between a citation context and a document. Our approach can recommend citations for a context effectively. Moreover, it can recommend a set of citations for a paper with high quality. We implement a prototype system in CiteSeerX. An extensive empirical evaluation in the CiteSeerX digital library against many baselines demonstrates the effectiveness and the scalability of our approach.},

abstract = {The extraordinary technological progress we have witnessed in recent years has made it possible to generate and exchange multimedia content at an unprecedented rate. As a consequence, massive collections of multimedia objects are now widely available to a large population of users. As the task of browsing such large collections could be daunting, Recommender Systems are being developed to assist users in finding items that match their needs and preferences. In this article, we present a novel approach to recommendation in multimedia browsing systems, based on modeling recommendation as a social choice problem. In social choice theory, a set of voters is called to rank a set of alternatives, and individual rankings are aggregated into a global ranking. In our formulation, the set of voters and the set of alternatives both coincide with the set of objects in the data collection. We first define what constitutes a choice in the browsing domain and then define a mechanism to aggregate individual choices into a global ranking. The result is a framework for computing customized recommendations by originally combining intrinsic features of multimedia objects, past behavior of individual users, and overall behavior of the entire community of users. Recommendations are ranked using an importance ranking algorithm that resembles the well-known PageRank strategy. Experiments conducted on a prototype of the proposed system confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.},

abstract = {Community question-answering (CQA) systems, such as Yahoo! Answers or Stack Overflow, belong to a prominent group of successful and popular Web 2.0 applications, which are used every day by millions of users to find an answer on complex, subjective, or context-dependent questions. In order to obtain answers effectively, CQA systems should optimally harness collective intelligence of the whole online community, which will be impossible without appropriate collaboration support provided by information technologies. Therefore, CQA became an interesting and promising subject of research in computer science and now we can gather the results of 10 years of research. Nevertheless, in spite of the increasing number of publications emerging each year, so far the research on CQA systems has missed a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey. We attempt to fill this gap by a review of 265 articles published between 2005 and 2014, which were selected from major conferences and journals. According to this evaluation, at first we propose a framework that defines descriptive attributes of CQA approaches. Second, we introduce a classification of all approaches with respect to problems they are aimed to solve. The classification is consequently employed in a review of a significant number of representative approaches, which are described by means of attributes from the descriptive framework. As a part of the survey, we also depict the current trends as well as highlight the areas that require further attention from the research community.},

abstract = {Welcome to CSCW 2017, the ACM 2017 Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing! We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous "revise and resubmit" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on "Conversational AI &amp; Lessons Learned." Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, "The Science Gap." We also welcome Paul Luff and Christian Heath from King's College as the recipients of this year's CSCW Lasting Impact award for their influential 1998 paper, "Mobility in Collaboration."},

abstract = {Welcome to ITiCSE 2015 in Vilnius!The ITiCSE conference celebrates its 20th anniversary in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania and the geographical center of Europe, so declared in 1989 by scientists of the French National Institute of Geography.ITiCSE will be held on July 6--8, starting on Lithuania's Statehood Day (July 6). This is an annual public holiday that commemorates the coronation in 1253 of Mindaugas as the first and only King of Lithuania. The conference venue is the Parliament buildings (Seimas) of the Republic of Lithuania, and the conference dinner is to served in the reconstructed Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania, one of the most famous in Europe in the 15--17th centuries. ITiCSE 2015 is hosted by Vilnius University, one of the oldest and most famous establishments of higher education in Eastern and Central Europe, founded in 1579. The conference organizers represent the Lithuanian research group of Informatics and Informatics Engineering Didactics at the Institute of Mathematics and Informatics of Vilnius University.This conference brings together delegates from all over the world to address pressing issues in computing education. In addition to invited lectures, papers, panels, posters, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware sessions, the conference provides facilities and exposure for working groups and exhibitions.The conference continues to be truly international with a total of 170 submissions from 40 countries on six continents, with authors from Africa (4), Asia (50), Europe (151), North America (119), Oceania (51), and South America (17). These submissions consisted of 124 research papers, 1 panel, 9 working group proposals, and 36 proposals for posters or for tips, techniques &amp; courseware.All research papers were double blind reviewed by at least four reviewers, though most papers received five or six reviews. A meta-review was conducted by the members of the conference committee to ensure the reliability of the reviews and to make recommendations to the chairs. A final selection phase was conducted by the program chairs who reviewed all reviews and meta-review recommendations before making their final decisions. As a result of this process, 54 research papers (43.5%) were selected for presentation and inclusion in the proceedings. The authors of the accepted papers come from 17 different countries on five continents.All poster submissions were blind reviewed by two members of the conference committee, and tips, techniques &amp; courseware submissions were blind reviewed by three members of the conference committee. Submissions in these categories were then reviewed by the conference chair before selection by the program chairs for final inclusion in the conference. Twenty-four were accepted, representing authors from 15 countries.The two keynote speakers address the learning of programming and computational thinking. Professor Mordechai (Moti) Ben-Ari from the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, will give a talk titled In Defense of Programming, which defends the (perhaps controversial) position that programming is the fundamental activity of CS. In the other keynote talk Professor Maciej M. Syslo from Nicolaus Copernicus University and University of Wroc\l{}aw, Poland, will address algorithmic nand computational thinking as the way to computing for all students.ITiCSE is famous for its working groups. Participating in a working group provides a unique opportunity to work with people from different countries who are interested and knowledgeable in the area of the working group. It is also one of the best ways to become part of the ITiCSE community. Seven working groups have been accepted over a broad spectrum of topics. The working groups range from general topics, such as computing education terminology, CS education in K-9 and K-12 schools, and designing an IT curriculum framework for graduates in 2025, to more specific topics such as developing a repository for high school CS questions, visual assessment tools and metadata annotations, and how students construct solutions to programming problems. The leaders of the accepted working groups come from over 13 countries.Welcome to Vilnius and enjoy the vicennial ITiCSE conference and Lithuania's Statehood Day!},
