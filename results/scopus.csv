In general, supervised machine learning models like support vector machine and recently fast-growing deep neural networks method have been extensively used as a sentiment learning approach. Although some neural network-based models learn text features without feature engineering, most of them only focus on extracting semantic representations from single words and rarely consider the contexts attributed to the correlation between words and sentences. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model to capture the context information from texts. Our model builds a hybrid neural network model using convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory for word context extraction and document representation, respectively. On this basis, user’s and product’s information can be incorporated into the model. The experimental results show the competitive performance of our model, compared to all state-of-the-art methods. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.",""

We propose a machine learning based method for semantic labeling that utilizes phone usage features to detect the user's home, work, and other visited places. For place detection, we compare seven different classification methods. We organize the phone usage data based on periods of uninterrupted time that the user has been in a certain place. We consider three approaches to represent this data: Visits, places, and cumulative samples. Our main contribution is semantic place labeling using a small set of privacy-preserving features and novel data representations suitable for resource constrained mobile devices. The contributions include (1) introduction of novel data representations including accumulation and averaging of the usage, (2) analysis of the effect of the data accumulation time on the accuracy of the place classification, (3) analysis of the confidence on the classification outcome, and (4) identification of the most relevant features obtained through feature selection methods.

False information has become an important research topic due to the massive amount of misinformed content on social networks. It is very easy for any user to spread misinformation through the media. Therefore, misinformation is a problem for professionals, organizers, and societies. Hence, it is essential to observe the credibility and validity of the News articles being shared on social media. The core challenge is to distinguish the difference between accurate and false information. Recent studies focus on News article content, such as News titles and descriptions, which has limited their achievements. However, there are two ordinarily agreed-upon features of misinformation: first, the title and text of an article, and second, the user engagement. In the case of the News context, we extracted different user engagements with articles, for example, tweets, i.e., read-only, user retweets, likes, and shares. We calculate user credibility and combine it with article content with the user’s context. After combining both features, we used three Natural language processing (NLP) feature extraction techniques, i.e., Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Count-Vectorizer (CV), and Hashing-Vectorizer (HV). Then, we applied different machine learning classifiers to classify misinformation as real or fake. Therefore, we used a Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Byes (NB), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Boosting (GB), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The proposed method has been tested on a real-world dataset, i.e., “fakenewsnet”. We refine the fakenewsnet dataset repository according to our required features. The dataset contains 23000+ articles with millions of user engagements. The highest accuracy score is 93.4%. The proposed model achieves its highest accuracy using count vector features and a random forest classifier. Our discoveries confirmed that the proposed classifier would effectively classify misinformation in social networks. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

It involves the assignment of a class/label to an instance and is based on the assumption that each instance can only belong to one class. This assumption does not hold, especially for indexing problems (when an item, such as a movie, can belong to more than one category) or for complex items that reflect more than one aspect, e.g. a product review outlining advantages and disadvantages may be at the same time positive and negative. To address this problem, multi-label classification has been increasingly used in recent years, by transforming the data to allow an instance to have more than one label; the nature of learning, however, is the same as traditional learning, i.e. learning to discriminate one class from other classes and the output of a classifier is still single (although the output may contain a set of labels). In this paper we propose a fundamentally different type of classification in which the membership of an instance to all classes(/labels) is judged by a multiple-input-multiple-output classifier through generative multi-task learning. An experimental study is conducted on five UCI data sets to show empirically that an instance can belong to more than one class, by using the theory of fuzzy logic and checking the extent to which an instance belongs to each single class, i.e. the fuzzy membership degree.

Classification has been studied with the help of statistical methods for a long time. With the explosion of new better computer processing units (CPUs) and graphical processing units (GPUs) the interest in machine learning has grown exponentially and we can use both statistical learning algorithms as well as deep neural networks (DNNs) to solve the classification tasks. Classification is a supervised machine learning problem and there exists a large amount of methodology for performing such task. However, it is very rare in industrial applications that data is fully labeled which is why we need good methodology to obtain error-free labels. The purpose of this paper is to examine the current literature on how to perform labeling using ML, we will compare these models in terms of popularity and on what datatypes they are used on. We performed a systematic literature review of empirical studies for machine learning for labeling. We identified 43 primary studies relevant to our search. From this we were able to determine the most common machine learning models for labeling. Lack of unlabeled instances is a major problem for industry as supervised learning is the most widely used. Obtaining labels is costly in terms of labor and financial costs. Based on our findings in this review we present alternate ways for labeling data for use in supervised learning tasks.

However, existing deep learning-based automatic polyp segmentation methods mainly focused on independent static images and struggled to perform well due to neglecting spatial–temporal relationships among successive video frames, while requiring massive frame-by-frame annotations. To better alleviate these challenges, we proposed a novel semi-supervised spatial–temporal calibration and semantic refinement network (STCSR-Net) dedicated to VPS, which simultaneously considered both the inter-frame temporal consistency in video clips and intra-frame semantic-spatial information. It was composed of a segmentation pathway and a propagation pathway by use of a co-training scheme for supervising the predictions on un-annotated images in a semi-supervised learning fashion. Specifically, we proposed an adaptive sequence calibration (ASC) block in segmentation pathway and a dynamic transmission calibration (DTC) block in propagation pathway to fully take advantage of valuable temporal cues and maintain the prediction temporally consistent among consecutive frames. Meanwhile, in these two branches, we introduced residual block (RB) to suppress irrelevant noisy information and highlight rich local boundary details of polyp lesions, while constructed multi-scale context extraction (MCE) module to enhance multi-scale high-level semantic feature expression. On that basis, we designed progressive adaptive context fusion (PACF) module to gradually aggregate multi-level features under the guidance of reinforced high-level semantic information for eliminating semantic gaps among them and promoting the discrimination capacity of features for targeting polyp objects. Through synergistic combination of RB, MCE and PACF modules, semantic-spatial correlations on polyp lesions within each frame could be established. Coupled with the context-free loss, our model merged feature representations of neighboring frames to diminish the dependency on varying contexts within consecutive frames and strengthen its robustness. Extensive experiments substantiated that our model with 100% annotation ratio achieved state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets. Even trained under 50% annotation ratio, our model exceled significantly existing state-of-the-art image-based and video-based polyp segmentation models on the newly-built local TRPolyp dataset by at least 1.3% and 0.9% enhancements in both mDice and mIoU, whilst exhibited comparable performance to top rivals attained through using fully supervised approach on publicly available CVC-612, CVC-300 and ASU-Mayo-Clinic benchmarks. Notably, our model showcased exceptionally well in videos containing complex scenarios like motion blur and occlusion. Beyond that, it also harvested approximately 0.794 mDice and 0.707 mIoU at an inference of 0.036 s per frame in endoscopist-machine competition, which outperformed junior and senior endoscopists as well as almost matched with those of expert ones. The strong capability of the proposed STCSR-Net held promise in improving quality of VPS, accentuating model's adaptability and potential in real-world clinical scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",""

As a type of crucial temporal and spatial feature, nonlinear Granger Causality (NGC) analysis was applied to feature extraction of MI-electroencephalogram (EEG) signals because the constructed brain network features can reflect the causal relationship between different channels in various brain regions. However, the MI-BCI task recognition often suffer from the information redundancy of NGC features, and these redundant features will increase the complexity of the machine learning models and accordingly reduce the prediction accuracy of the classification algorithms. To address this problem, this paper proposes a step-by-step tent chaos simulated annealing salp swarm feature selection (STCSA_SaSFS) algorithm to select an optimal set of features in a wrapper feature selection model. Then, the effectiveness of this feature selection method is verified using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Through the study of task related MI-BCI EEG data from ten subjects, the experiments showed that the highest classification accuracy of NGC feature extraction plus STCSA_SaSFS reached 97.19%, and the average classification accuracy was 89.57%. This average classification accuracy was 20.07% higher than that of NGC feature extraction without any feature selection, and it is also 2.96% higher than that of NGC feature extraction plus a traditional SaSFS algorithm. The effectiveness of STCSA_SaSFS was also compared with that of other smart swarm optimization algorithms, such as the sparrow search feature selection algorithm (SpSFS). STCSA_SaSFS outperforms SpSFS with an average classification accuracy of 8.07%. The algorithm was validated using a public dataset validation consisting of 10 subjects, which ultimately showed that the feature selection method proposed in this paper (STSA_SaSAFS) has a large advantage in the classification performance of motor imagery brain-computer interface tasks. © 2023 The Author(s)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

Methods: This paper investigates feature selection in the MRA-based frameworks for BCI. Several wrapper approaches to evolutionary multiobjective feature selection are proposed with different structures of classifiers. They are evaluated by comparing with baseline methods using sparse representation of features or without feature selection. Results and conclusion: The statistical analysis, by applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff and Kruskal-Wallis tests to the means of the Kappa values evaluated by using the test patterns in each approach, has demonstrated some advantages of the proposed approaches. In comparison with the baseline MRA approach used in previous studies, the proposed evolutionary multiobjective feature selection approaches provide similar or even better classification performances, with significant reduction in the number of features that need to be computed. © 2016 The Author(s).","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access"

Algorithms for semi-supervised learning are popular in machine learning because of their minimal reliance on labeled data. There have been, however, only a few reports of semi-supervised learning in humans. Here we document human semi-supervised learning on a nonnative phonetic classification task. Classification performance remained unchanged when 60 feedback trials were provided on each of the two days of training. In contrast, performance improved when 60 feedback trials were combined with 240 no-feedback trials each day. In variants of this successful semi-supervised regimen, increasing the daily number of feedback trials from 60 to 240 did not increase the amount of learning, while decreasing that number to 30 abolished learning. Finally, replacing the no-feedback trials with stimulus exposure alone had little effect on the outcome. These results were an unexpected consequence of combining training periods with feedback and testing periods without feedback, illustrating that no-feedback testing can influence learning outcomes. More broadly, these data suggest that task performance with feedback can function as an all-or-none trigger for recruiting the contribution of trials without feedback, or mere stimulus exposures, to human learning. © 2019, The Psychonomic Society, Inc.","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access"

The primary challenge in this task arises from the subtle distinctions among various fine-grained action categories, which complicate the accurate localization of specific action instances. In this paper, we note that the context information embedded within the videos plays a crucial role in overcoming this challenge. However, we also find that effectively integrating context information across different scales is non-trivial, as not all scales provide equally valuable information for distinguishing fine-grained actions. Based on these observations, we propose a weakly-supervised fine-grained temporal action localization approach termed the Context Sensitive Network, which aims to fully leverage context information. Specifically, we first introduce a multi-scale context extraction module designed to efficiently capture multi-scale temporal contexts. Subsequently, we develop a scale-sensitive context gating module that facilitates interaction among multi-scale contexts and adaptively selects informative contexts based on varying video content.

To measure SPL from speech recordings, a standard calibration tone (with a reference SPL of 94 dB or 114 dB) needs to be recorded together with speech. However, most of the popular databases that are used in areas such as speech and speaker recognition have been recorded without calibration information by expressing speech on arbitrary amplitude scales. Therefore, information about vocal intensity of the recorded speech, including SPL, is lost. In the current study, we introduce a new open and calibrated speech/electroglottography (EGG) database named Aalto Vocal Intensity Database (AVID). AVID includes speech and EGG produced by 50 speakers (25 males, 25 females) who varied their vocal intensity in four categories (soft, normal, loud and very loud). Recordings were conducted using a constant mouth-to-microphone distance and by recording a calibration tone. The speech data was labelled sentence-wise using a total of 19 labels that support the utilisation of the data in machine learning (ML) -based studies of vocal intensity based on supervised learning. In order to demonstrate how the AVID data can be used to study vocal intensity, we investigated one multi-class classification task (classification of speech into soft, normal, loud and very loud intensity classes) and one regression task (prediction of SPL of speech). In both tasks, we deliberately warped the level of the input speech by normalising the signal to have its maximum amplitude equal to 1.0, that is, we simulated a scenario that is prevalent in current speech databases. The results show that using the spectrogram feature with the support vector machine classifier gave an accuracy of 82% in the multi-class classification of the vocal intensity category. In the prediction of SPL, using the spectrogram feature with the support vector regressor gave an mean absolute error of about 2 dB and a coefficient of determination of 92%. We welcome researchers interested in classification and regression problems to utilise AVID in the study of vocal intensity, and we hope that the current results could serve as baselines for future ML studies on the topic. © 2024 The Author(s)","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

Relevant features not only decrease the processing time to train a classifier but also provide better generalization. Hence, relevant features which provide maximum classification accuracy are selected using ratio of scatter matrices, Chernoff distance measure and linear regression.

In the first stage, we employed an intelligent feature pre-screening operation to get a rough feature subset, which introduced MIC value as the correlation measure and automated the determination of the screening threshold by Q-learning. In the second stage, we applied an improved PSO-based method to get an optimal feature subset. During this stage, a swarm initialization strategy based on MIC correlation was used to narrow the search range and accelerate swarm convergence. To further enhance the exploitability, a deeper local search operation was performed in the search region. Moreover, a particle reset strategy was adopted to help particles jump out of the local optimal solution.

Contrastive Hebbian learning, which is a powerful rule inspired by gradient backpropagation, is based on Hebb's rule and the contrastive divergence algorithm. It operates in two phases, the free phase, where the data are fed to the network, and a clamped phase, where the target signals are clamped to the output layer of the network and the feedback signals are transformed through the transpose synaptic weight matrices. This implies symmetries at the synaptic level, for which there is no evidence in the brain so far. In this work, we propose a new variant of the algorithm, called random contrastive Hebbian learning, which does not rely on any synaptic weights symmetries. Instead, it uses random matrices to transform the feedback signals during the clamped phase, and the neural dynamics are described by first order non-linear differential equations. The algorithm is experimentally verified by solving a Boolean logic task, classification tasks (handwritten digits and letters), and an autoencoding task. This article also shows how the parameters affect learning, especially the random matrices. We use the pseudospectra analysis to investigate further how random matrices impact the learning process.

This study focuses on the application of self-supervised learning in tackling cocoa disease detection and classification challenges by taking cocoa swollen shoot virus disease (CSSVD) and anthracnose. Self-supervised learning has proven to offer resilience against both OOD and adversarial attacks and as an alternative to the cost involved in the annotation process of the vast amount of data. This work leverages a contrastive self-supervised learning pretext model trained on cocoa leaves and pods, a remarkable performance was shown when we fine-tuned and pre-trained on a downstream task. Several works are being done on the subject of self-supervised learning and fully-supervised learning. In order to get the best out of these two techniques, we propose a hybrid approach which will combine both SLL and fully supervised learning. Thus in any deep learning project regardless of the amount of annotated dataset around, a pretext model should be developed from the dataset which can then be fined-tuned using the entire dataset at hand. Three models were developed and the best come in as a result of fine-tuning the learnt features using the entire dataset. After performing the downstream task (classification of cocoa diseases) a validation accuracy of 87%, 72% and 69% for the fine-tune, fully-supervised and pre-trained respectively were obtained.

Motor Imagery-based electroencephalogram (EEG) signals provide the interaction and communication between the paralyzed patients and the outside world for moving and controlling external devices such as wheelchair and moving cursors. However, current approaches in the Motor Imagery-BCI system design require effective feature extraction methods and classification algorithms to acquire discriminative features from EEG signals due to the non-linear and non-stationary structure of EEG signals. This study investigates the effect of statistical significance-based feature selection on binary and multi-class Motor Imagery EEG signal classifications. In the feature extraction process performed 24 different time-domain features, 15 different frequency-domain features which are energy, variance, and entropy of Fourier transform within five EEG frequency subbands, 15 different time-frequency domain features which are energy, variance, and entropy of Wavelet transform based on five EEG frequency subbands, and 4 different Poincare plot-based non-linear parameters are extracted from each EEG channel. A total of 1,364 Motor Imagery EEG features are supplied from 22 channel EEG signals for each input EEG data. In the statistical significance-based feature selection process, the best one among all possible combinations of these features is tried to be determined using the independent t-test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test on binary and multi-class Motor Imagery EEG signal classifications, respectively. The whole extracted feature set and the feature set that contain statistically significant features only are classified in this study. We implemented 6 and 7 different classifiers in multi-class and binary (two-class) classification tasks, respectively. The classification process is evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method, and each classification algorithm is tested 10 times. These repeated tests provide to check the repeatability of the results. The maximum of 61.86 and 47.36% for the two-class and four-class scenarios, respectively, are obtained with Ensemble Subspace Discriminant among all these classifiers using selected features including only statistically significant features. The results reveal that the introduced statistical significance-based feature selection approach improves the classifier performances by achieving higher classifier performances with fewer relevant components in Motor Imagery task classification. In conclusion, the main contribution of the presented study is two-fold evaluation of non-linear parameters as an alternative to the commonly used features and the prediction of multiple Motor Imagery tasks using statistically significant features.

It is important to know the composition of stone(s) to decide the kind of treatment and help in post-operative care to reduce re-occurrence. This study has a novel aim of selecting the best model for predicting the extent of each chemical present in the stone(s) of a patient from radiographic images (in vivo analysis). Methods: For the stone composition analysis from images, five supervised learning models were used for multi-class-multi-output classification or multi-task classification. Multi-task classification was best suited in this case as there were seven target chemicals—calcium, magnesium, uric acid, ammonia, oxalate, phosphate, and carbonate; each of which was classified as absent, low, moderate, or high simultaneously. The metrics for such classifications are not defined in general because multiple criteria cause anomalies. Results: In the present work, the F1 score with which each model classifies each chemical was computed, and a multi-criteria decision-making algorithm called Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to find the best model. The k-nearest neighbour classifier has given the best TOPSIS performance score of 0.9034. Conclusion: There are five different machine learning (ML) models considered in the study and were evaluated on their F1 score for each target chemical. Each of the ML classifiers was multi-class multi-output (MCMO) model, and the ultimate choice was made based on the outcome of the TOPSIS algorithm. The KNN model has found to outperform the others.

Here, using Human Connectome Project data, we build upon recent studies examining brain-based fingerprints of individual subjects and cognitive states based on cognitively demanding tasks that assess, for example, working memory, theory of mind, and motor function. Our approach achieves accuracy of up to 99% for both identification of the subject of an fMRI scan, and for classification of the cognitive state of a previously unseen subject in a scan. More broadly, we explore the accuracy and reliability of five different machine learning techniques on subject fingerprinting and cognitive state decoding objectives, using functional connectivity data from fMRI scans of a high number of subjects (865) across a number of cognitive states (8). These results represent an advance on existing techniques for functional connectivity-based brain fingerprinting and state decoding.

There however remain a number of challenges in building a generalized mental workload recognition model, one of which includes the inability of an EEG-based workload classifier trained on a specific task to handle other tasks. The primary goal of the present study was to examine the possibility of addressing this challenge using feature selection and regression model. Support vector machine classifier and regression models were examined under within-task conditions (trained and tested on the same task) and cross-task conditions (trained on one task and tested on another task) for well-trained verbal and spatial n-back tasks. A specifically designed cross-task recursive feature elimination (RFE) based feature selection was used to handle the possible causes responsible for the deterioration of the performance of cross-task regression model. The within-task classification and regression performed fairly well. Cross-task classification and regression performance, however, deteriorated to unacceptable levels (around chance level). Trained and tested with the most robust feature subset selected by cross-task RFE, the performance of cross-task regression was significantly improved, and there were no significant changes in the performance of within-task regression. It can be inferred that workload-related features can be picked out from those which have been contaminated using RFE, and regression models rather than classifiers may be a wiser choice for cross-task conditions. These encouraging results suggest that the cross-task workload recognition model built in this study is much more generalizable across task when compared to the model built in traditional way. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",""

The applications aim to understand the user's context (e.g., home or at work) and provide services tailored to the users. The algorithms responsible for inferring the user's context are the so-called context inference algorithms, the place detection being a particular case. Our hypothesis is that people use mobile phones differently when they are located in different places (e.g. longer calls at home than at work). Therefore, the usage of the mobile phones could be an indicator of the users' current context. The objective of the work is to develop a system that can estimate the user's place label (home, work, etc.), based on phone usage. As training and validation set, we use a database containing phone usage information of 200 users over several months including phone call and SMS logs, multimedia usage, accelerometer, GPS, network information and system information. The data was split into visits, i.e., periods of uninterrupted time that the user has been in a certain place (Home, Work, Leisure, etc.). The data include information about the phone usage during the visits, and the semantic label of the place visited (Home, Work, etc.). We consider two approaches to represent this data: the first approach (so-called visits approach) saves each visit separately; the second approach (so-called places approach) combines all visits of one user to a certain place and creates place-specific information. For place detection, we used five popular classification methods, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, Bagged Tree, Neural Network and K-Nearest Neighbors, in both representation approaches. We evaluated their classification rates and found that: 1) Bagged Tree outperforms the other methods; 2) the places data-representation gives better results than the visits data-representation. © 2014 IEEE.",""

Besides given training data, AutoML relies on a suitable learning objective or scoring function and a search space in which to optimize the choices. Currently, most AutoML technologies focus on a single objective, which is related to the expected accuracy of the found model as evaluated according to the chosen learning objective. Additional desired characteristics such as model sparsity for an increased model efficiency and interpretability can be integrated as additional penalty terms in the objective function. Yet, this leads to one solution only, and does not mediate in between accuracy and sparsity as two usually contradicting objectives. In this contribution, we are interested in AutoML technologies which explore the full Pareto-front of sparse versus accurate models rather than a single average only. Since it is not guaranteed that architectural and meta-parameter choices stay constant along the full Pareto-front, averaging the two objectives is not necessarily optimal in this realm. Hence we propose how to treat this challenge by a novel iterative pipeline, which combines an AutoML method with feature selection technologies. We compare this technology to alternatives including baselines in two relevant modeling tasks, classification and outlier detection. We demonstrate the performance of these strategies for a couple of benchmark tasks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",""

The cells that produce dopamine in the brain are responsible for the control, adaptation and fluency of movements. When 60–80%of these cells are lost, then enough dopamine is not produced and Parkinson's motor symptoms appear. It is thought that the disease begins many years before the motor (movement related) symptoms and therefore, researchers are looking for ways to recognize the non-motor symptoms that appear early in the disease as early as possible, thereby halting the progression of the disease. In this paper, machine learning based diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is presented. The proposed diagnosis method consists of feature selection and classification processes. Feature Importance and Recursive Feature Elimination methods were considered for feature selection task. Classification and Regression Trees, Artificial Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines were used for the classification of Parkinson's patients in the experiments. Support Vector Machines with Recursive Feature Elimination was shown to perform better than the other methods. 93.84% accuracy was achieved with the least number of voice features for Parkinson's diagnosis. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",""

Our SASSL integrates a stain domain adversarial training module into the self-supervised learning (SSL) framework, allowing adaptation to staining variations while learning invariant features. SASSL can be viewed as a general invariant representation SSL method, with derived self-supervised weights applicable to various downstream tasks (classification, regression, and segmentation) in histopathological images. We conducted experiments on publicly available histopathological image analysis datasets, including PANDA, BreastPathQ, and CAMELYON16, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

The study addresses the gaps in incorporating the needs of users and other context information in app classification as well as recommendation systems. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a corpus of mobile app descriptions collected from Google Play store, this study applies extensive text analytics and topic modeling procedures to profile mobile apps within the categories of the classification scheme. Sufficient number of representative and labeled app descriptions are then used to train a classifier using machine learning algorithms, such as rule-based, decision tree and artificial neural network. Findings: Experimental results of the classifiers show high accuracy in automatically labeling new apps based on their descriptions. The accuracy of the classification results suggests a feasible direction in facilitating app searching and retrieval in different Web-based usage environments.

Practical implications: These empirical experiments demonstrate the feasibility of textual data analysis in profiling apps and user context information. This study also benefits app developers by improving app descriptions through a better understanding of user needs and context information. Finally, the classification framework can also guide practitioners in customizing products and services beyond mobile apps where context information and user needs play an important role.

It is often easy to be overlooked in the early stage, leading to serious problems. Therefore, it is crucial to detect stress before it evolves into severe problems. Traditional stress detection methods are based on either questionnaires or professional devices, which are time-consuming, costly and intrusive. With the popularity of smartphones with various embedded sensors, which can capture users' context data contains movement, sound, location and so on, it is an alternative way to access users' behavior by smartphones, which is less intrusive. This paper proposes an automatic and non-intrusive stress detection approach based on mobile sensing data captured by smartphones. By extracting reasonable features from the perceived data, a more efficient psychological stress assessment method is proposed. First, we generate lots of features represent users' behavior and explore the correlation between mobile sensing data and stress, then identify discriminative features. Second, we further develop a semi-supervised learning based stress detection model. Specifically, we use techniques such as co-training and random forest to deal with insufficient data. Finally, we evaluate our model based on the StudentLife dataset, and the experimental results verify the advantages of our approach over other baselines. © 2019, Science Press.

In the recent years, due to the vast and rapid increase in the size of data, classification has been mainly undertaken in the way of supervised machine learning. In this context, a classification task involves data labelling, feature extraction, feature selection and learning of classifiers. In traditional machine learning, data is usually single-labelled by experts, i.e., each instance is only assigned one class label, since experts assume that different classes are mutually exclusive and each instance is clear-cut. However, the above assumption does not always hold in real applications. For example, in the context of emotion detection, there could be more than one emotion identified from the same person. On the other hand, feature selection has typically been done by evaluating feature subsets in terms of their relevance to all the classes. However, it is possible that a feature is only relevant to one class, but is irrelevant to all the other classes. Based on the above argumentation on data labelling and feature selection, we propose in this paper a framework of multi-task learning. In particular, we consider traditional machine learning to be single task learning, and argue the necessity to turn it into multi-task learning to allow an instance to belong to more than one class (i.e., multi-task classification) and to achieve class specific feature selection (i.e., multi-task feature selection). Moreover, we report two experimental studies in terms of fuzzy multi-task classification and rule learning based multi-task feature selection. The results show empirically that it is necessary to undertake multi-task learning for both classification and feature selection. © 2017, The Author(s).","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access"

We addressed this issue by evaluating several classification models using EEG and eye tracking data. We recorded that training data simultaneously during tasks that required internal attention in an N-Back task or external attention allocation in Visual Monitoring. We used linear and deep learning models to compare classification performance under several uni- and multimodal feature sets alongside different window sizes.

Typically, it seeks to recommend a sequence of Points of Interest (POIs) for users by considering various factors, such as time constraints, itinerary length, starting and ending POIs. Traditional itinerary recommendation primarily relies on heuristic approaches to address the orienteering problem, aiming to maximize global rewards under budget constraints, or methods that use stochastic processes to model POI-POI transition patterns. These methods fail to capture transitional regularities and develop a comprehensive understanding of user preferences, which may result in recommendations that diverge from tourists’ actual travel intentions, particularly when trip data is sparse. While recent models based on neural networks, such as Transformers, address some of these challenges, they often overlook practical realities, including noisy implicit feedback, the factors that affect tourists’ demands and the complexity of their visiting preferences. Motivated by the benefits of self-supervised contrastive learning, we propose a Self-supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) framework to the domain of itinerary recommendation. Specifically, a contrastive learning mechanism is presented, focusing on POI representation and two data augmentation operations are designed based on POI correlations to capture the visiting uncertainties in itinerary generation. Additionally, multiple contextual factors are considered, including sequential information, geographic information and POI-POI transition pattern, to effectively capture and update real-time user context. The experimental results demonstrate SCL achieves significant improvements in terms of three metrics, compared with the best performing baseline method. Recall improved by 3.51%–10.31%, Precision improved by 3.42%–12.57% and Levenshtein Distance Similarity (LDS), defined as the normalized similarity between two itineraries based on the minimum edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to align them, improved by 3.46%–14.73%. The statistical Friedman-Nemenyi test further confirms the robustness of the SCL model. Furthermore, to provide an intuitive understanding of itinerary recommendations generated by SCL, a case study is presented using a randomized example. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",""

There is a growing interest in the development of machine learning methods that can automate the analysis and interpretation of microscopy images. Typically training of machine learning models requires large numbers of images with associated structural labels, however, manual labeling of images requires domain knowledge and is prone to human error and subjectivity. To overcome these limitations, we present a semi-supervised transfer learning approach that uses a small number of labeled microscopy images for training and performs as effectively as methods trained on significantly larger image datasets. Specifically, we train an image encoder with unlabeled images using self-supervised learning methods and use that encoder for transfer learning of different downstream image tasks (classification and segmentation) with a minimal number of labeled images for training. We test the transfer learning ability of two self-supervised learning methods: SimCLR and Barlow-Twins on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. We demonstrate in detail how this machine learning workflow applied to TEM images of protein nanowires enables automated classification of nanowire morphologies (e.g., single nanowires, nanowire bundles, phase separated) as well as segmentation tasks that can serve as groundwork for quantification of nanowire domain sizes and shape analysis.

Hence, it is difficult to achieve high classification accuracy. Although various machine learning methods have already proven useful to that effect, the use of many features and ineffective EEG channels often leads to a complex structure of classifier algorithms. State-of-the-art studies were interested in improving classification performance with complex feature extraction and classification methods by neglecting detailed EEG channel and feature investigation in predicting MI tasks from EEGs. Here, we investigate the effects of the statistically significant feature selection method on four different feature domains (time-domain, frequency-domain, time-frequency domain, and non-linear domain) and their two different combinations to reduce the number of features and classify MI-EEG features by comparing low-dimensional matrices with well-known machine learning algorithms. Methods: Our main goal is not to find the best classifier performance but to perform feature and channel investigation in MI task classification. Therefore, the detailed investigation of the effect of EEG channels and features is implemented using a statistically significant feature distribution on 22 EEG channels for each feature set separately. We used the BCI Competition IV Dataset IIa and 288 samples per person. A total of 1,364 MI-EEG features were analyzed in this study. We tested nine distinct classifiers: Decision tree, Discriminant analysis, Logistic regression, Naive Bayes, Support vector machine, k-Nearest neighbor, Ensemble learning, Neural networks, and Kernel approximation. Results: Among all feature sets considered, classifications performed with non-linear and combined feature sets resulted in a maximum accuracy of 63.04% and 47.36% for binary and multiple MI task predictions, respectively. The ensemble learning classifier achieved the maximum accuracy in almost all feature sets for binary and multiple MI task classifications. Discussion: Our research thus shows that the statistically significant feature-based feature selection method significantly improves the classification performance with fewer features in almost all feature sets, enabling detailed and effective EEG channel and feature investigation.

One of the maj or goal of fMRI research is the task classification based on the activity of brain states. Every time, it remains a challenge for such researchers to extract optimum features from brain images due to high dimensional quantity of the data in fMRI Images. In this paper, the authors proposed a novel feature selection technique based on Fast Fourier Transform with Particle Swarm Optimization and Genetic Algorithm (FFT-PSOGA) for extracting the best features in fMRI dataset. The resulted features are trained for machine learning models of GaussianNB, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost and compared for performance with state-of-art. The achieved results are outperforming the existing works based on the same dataset. The authors believe that the feature selection technique proposed in this paper will be the optimal method for extracting brain images' features in any fMRI dataset which will improve the classification accuracy of the decoding of brain images in a much better way. © 2021 IEEE.",""

Scholarly databases are valuable sources for publications and citation information where researchers can publish their ideas and results. Sentiment analysis of scientific citations aims to analyze the authors’ sentiments within scientific citations. During the last decade, some review papers have been published in the field of sentiment analysis. Despite the growth in the size of scholarly databases and researchers’ interests, no one as far as we know has carried out an in-depth survey in a specific area of sentiment analysis in scientific citations. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of sentiment analysis of scientific citations. In this review, the process of scientific citation sentiment analysis is introduced and recently proposed methods with the main challenges are presented, analyzed and discussed. Further, we present related fields such as citation function classification and citation recommendation that have recently gained enormous attention. Our contributions include identifying the most important challenges as well as the analysis and classification of recent methods used in scientific citation sentiment analysis. Moreover, it presents the normal process, and this includes citation context extraction, public data sources, and feature selection. We found that most of the papers use classical machine learning methods. However, due to limitations of performance and manual feature selection in machine learning, we believe that in the future hybrid and deep learning methods can possibly handle the problems of scientific citation sentiment analysis more efficiently and reliably. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",""

Meaning disambiguation is not an end in itself, it is an intermediate process, necessary at a certain level to use in natural language processing. It is obviously useful for applications that require language interpretation (message communication, human-machine interaction), but it is also used in fields whose main purpose is not to understand natural language. In this paper we propose an approach for word sense disambiguation for Romanian language, based on a supervised learning, a large number of features, and information gain to reduce the dimensions. The evaluation for the Romanian words subtask is produced by the extensive feature set in conjunction with a Maximum Entropy classifier and outcomes that are better than other similar researches. © 2023 The Authors.

While recent state-of-the-art HAR research has demonstrated impressive performance, some key aspects remain under-explored. First, we believe that for optimal performance, HAR models should be both Context-Aware (CA) and personalized. However, prior work has predominantly focused on being Context-Aware (CA), largely ignoring being User-Aware (UA). We argue that learning user-specific differences in performing various activities is as critical as considering user context while performing HAR tasks. Secondly, we believe that the predictions of HAR models should be unified, reliably recognizing the same activity even when performed by different users. As such, the representations utilized by CA and UA models should explicitly place different users performing the same activity closer together. Moreover, identifying the user performing an activity is useful in applications such as thwarting cheating by having another person perform medically-prescribed activities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Auxiliary User Detection for Identifying Activities (CLAUDIA), a novel framework designed to address these issues. Specifically, we expand the contextual scope of the CAHAR task by integrating User Identification (UI) within the CAHAR framework, jointly predicting both CAHAR and UI in a new task called User and Context-Aware HAR (UCA-HAR). This approach enriches personalized and contextual understanding by jointly learning user-invariant and user-specific patterns. Inspired by state-of-the-art designs in the visual domain, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss objective on instance-instance pairs to enhance model efficacy and improve learned feature quality. Through theoretical exposition, empirical analysis of real-world datasets, and rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate the significance of each component of CLAUDIA and discuss its relationship with existing methodologies. Evaluation across three real-world CA-HAR datasets reveals substantial performance enhancements, with average improvements ranging from 11.7% to 14.2% in Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and 5.4% to 7.3 % in Macro F1 score.

Many researchers have been working on developing successful motor imagery (MI)-based BCI systems. However, they still face challenges in producing better performance with them because of the irrelevant features and high computational complexity. Selecting discriminative and relevant features to overcome the existing issues is crucial. In our proposed work, different feature selection algorithms have been studied to reduce the dimension of multiband feature space to improve MI task classification performance. In the procedure, we first decomposed the MI-based EEG signal into four sets of the narrowband signal. Then a common spatial pattern (CSP) approach was employed for each narrowband to extract and combine effective features, producing a high-dimensional feature vector. Three feature selection approaches, named correlation-based feature selection (CFS), minimum redundancy and maximum relevance (mRMR), and multi-subspace randomization and collaboration-based unsupervised feature selection (SRCFS), were used in this study to select the relevant and effective features for improving classification accuracy. Among them, the SRCFS feature selection approach demonstrated outstanding performance for MI classification compared to other schemes. The SRCFS is based on the multiple k-nearest neighbour graphs method for learning feature weight based on the Laplacian score and then discarding the irrelevant features based on the weight value, reducing the feature dimension. Finally, the selected features are fed into the support vector machines (SVM), linear discriminative analysis (LDA), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) for classification. The proposed model is evaluated with two benchmark datasets, namely BCI Competition III dataset IVA and dataset IIIB, which are publicly available and mainly used to recognize the MI tasks. The LDA classifier with the SRCFS feature selection algorithm exhibits better performance. It proves the superiority of our proposed study compared to the other state-of-the-art BCI-based MI task classification systems. © 2023 by the authors.","All Open Access; Gold Open Access"

For example, for entertainment many people use their smartphones to watch videos or listen to music. Many users, however, stream or play videos with the intention to only listen to the audio track. This way, some battery energy, which is critical to most users, is unnecessarily consumed thus and switching between video and audio can increase the time of use of the smartphone between battery recharges. In this paper, we present a first approach that, based on the user context, can automatically switch between video and audio. A supervised learning approach is used along with the classifiers K-Nearest Neighbors, Hoeffding Trees and Naive Bayes, individually and combined to create an ensemble classifier. We investigate the accuracy for recognizing the context of the user and the overhead that this system can have on the smartphone energy consumption. We evaluate our approach with several usage scenarios and an average accuracy of 88.40% was obtained for the ensemble classifier. However, the actual overhead of the system on the smartphone energy consumption highlights the need for researching further optimizations and techniques. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",""
