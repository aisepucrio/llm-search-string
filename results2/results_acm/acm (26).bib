abstract = {The lack of mature tool support is one of the main reasons that make the industry to be reluctant to adopt Software Product Line (SPL) approaches. A number of systematic literature reviews exist that identify the main characteristics offered by existing tools and the SPL phases in which they can be applied. However, these reviews do not really help to understand if those tools are offering what is really needed to apply SPLs to complex projects. These studies are mainly based on information extracted from the tool documentation or published papers. In this paper, we follow a different approach, in which we firstly identify those characteristics that are currently essential for the development of an SPL, and secondly analyze whether the tools provide or not support for those characteristics. We focus on those tools that satisfy certain selection criteria (e.g., they can be downloaded and are ready to be used). The paper presents a state of practice with the availability and usability of the existing tools for SPL, and defines different roadmaps that allow carrying out a complete SPL process with the existing tool support.},

abstract = {Agile software development (ASD) and software product line (SPL) have shown significant benefits for software engineering processes and practices. Although both methodologies promise similar benefits, they are based on different foundations. SPL encourages systematic reuse that exploits the commonalities of various products belonging to a common domain and manages their variations systematically. In contrast, ASD stresses a flexible and rapid development of products using iterative and incremental approaches. ASD encourages active involvement of customers and their frequent feedback. Both ASD and SPL require alternatives to extend agile methods for several reasons such as (1) to manage reusability and variability across the products of any domain, (2) to avoid the risk of developing core assets that will become obsolete and not used in future projects, and (3) to meet the requirements of changing markets. This motivates the researchers for the integration of ASD and SPL approaches. As a result, an innovative approach called agile product line engineering (APLE) by integrating SPL and ASD has been introduced. The principal aim of APLE is to maximize the benefits of ASD and SPL and address the shortcomings of both. However, combining both is a major challenge. Researchers have proposed a few approaches that try to put APLE into practice, but none of the existing approaches cover all APLE features needed. This paper proposes a new dynamic variability approach for APLE that uses APLE practices for reusing features. The proposed approach (PA) is based on the agile method Scrum and the reactive approach of SPL. In this approach, reusable core assets respond reactively to customer requirements. The PA constructs and develops the SPL architecture iteratively and incrementally. It provides the benefits of reusability and maintainability of SPLs while keeping the delivery-focused approach from agile methods. We conducted a quantitative survey of software companies applying the APLE to assess the performance of the PA and hypotheses of empirical study. Findings of empirical evaluation provide evidence on integrating ASD and SPL and the application of APLE into practices.},

abstract = {The variability of product lines increases over time thereby leading to an increasing effort for testing. Since the available time for test activities is limited an efficiency improvement is needed to ensure that products have sufficient quality.This paper introduces risk-based testing for software product lines. Our approach is based on risk based testing for single system engineering which is extended with a dimension that captures the percentage of product variants that use a particular development artifact. Based on the risk of development artifacts, the priorities for domain and application engineering are determined. We demonstrate our approach using a case study from an existing product line and discuss tool support.We conclude that the basic ideas behind risk-based testing for product lines are intuitive, pragmatic in nature, and provide the means for practitioners for guiding the test effort.},

The use of an incomplete implementation of SPLE's three essential activities temporally improves the productivity of the application developments due to the effect of refactored software, but this gradually decreases through architecture erosion.},

abstract = {Product line engineering (PLE) approaches have been followed in industry for hardware and software solutions for more than three decades now. However, the different engineering disciplines (e.g. mechanics, electrics, software) have developed and evolved their approaches within their own realms, which is fine as long as there is no need for integrated approaches. Driven by the increasing complexity of systems, there is a rising need for interdisciplinary systems engineering these days. Companies engineering cyber-physical systems and their components have to integrate product line engineering approaches across the involved engineering disciplines to enable a global optimization of portfolio, solution structures, and assets along their lifecycle. From a bird's-eye view, there is noticeable commonality but also variety in the approaches followed for PLE in the different engineering disciplines, which renders the integration of approaches a non-trivial endeavour. In order to foster the development of integrated PLE approaches, this paper explores, maps, and compares PLE approaches in the field of hardware and software engineering. Furthermore, the paper identifies integration opportunities and challenges. As the paper targets industrial practitioners, it mainly provides references to respective industrial events and material and does not fully cover related work in the respective research communities.},

abstract = {In order to achieve economies of scale, a Software as a Service (SaaS) should be configurable, multi-tenant efficient, and scalable. But building SaaS with these characteristics comes at a price of having more complex services. Some works in the literature integrate software product line engineering and service-oriented architecture to tackle the complexity of building multi-tenant SaaS. Most of these works focused on centralized approaches that rely on middleware or platforms, but they do not investigate the use of decentralized architectural style. Microservices architecture is an architectural style that relies on small, decentralized, and autonomous services that work together. Thus, this paper investigates the integrated use of microservices architecture and software produt line techniques to develop multi-tenant SaaS. We conducted an empirical study that analyzes the behavior of software reuse during the evolution of a multi-tenant SaaS. This empirical study showed an average software reuse of 62% of lines of code among tenants. We also provide lessons we learned during the the re-engineering and maintenance of such multi-tenant SaaS.},

While a substantial amount of variability realization approaches has already been published on source code level, there is little guidance for practitioners on system model level. Hence, there is major uncertainty in dealing with system changes or concurrent system modeling of related system. Due to a poor modularization and variability realization these model variants are ending up in interwoven and complex system models.In this paper, we aim to raise awareness of the need for appropriate guidance and decision support, identify important contextual factors of MBSE that influence variability realization, and derive well known variability mechanisms used in software coding for their applicability in system modeling.},

abstract = {A microservice implements a small unit of functionality that it provides through a network using lightweight protocols. So, microservices can be combined to fulfill tasks and implement features of a larger software system---resembling a variability mechanism in the context of a software product line (SPL). Microservices and SPLs have similar goals, namely facilitating reuse and customizing, but they are usually employed in different contexts. Any developer who has access to the network can provide a microservice for any task, while SPLs are usually intended to implement features of a specific domain. Due to their different concepts, using microservices to implement an SPL or adopting SPL practices (e.g., variability management) for microservices is a challenging cross-area research problem. However, both techniques can complement each other, and thus tackling this problem promises benefits for organizations that employ either technique. In this paper, we reason on the importance of advancing in this direction, and sketch six concrete challenges to initiate research, namely (1) feature identification, (2) variability modeling, (3) variable microservice architectures, (4) interchangeability, (5) deep customization, and (6) re-engineering an SPL. We intend these challenges to serve as a starting point for future research in this cross-area research direction---avoiding that the concepts of one area are reinvented in the other.},

abstract = {TSoftware Product Line (SPL) Engineering is a software development paradigm that fosters systematic reuse. It is focused on improving software practices, leading companies to experience benefits, such as reduced time-to-market and effort, and higher quality for the products delivered to customers. However, establishing a SPL is neither a simple nor a cheap task, and may affect several aspects of a software company. Besides, it involves a range of risks that may hinder project success. These have to be managed accordingly, so as to minimize the likelihood of project failure. Despite the importance of Risk Management (RM) for SPL Engineering, little has been published in terms of suitable and structured practices to cope with that. This present paper reports an approach for RM in SPL Engineering, named RiPLERM (Rise Product Line Engineering and Risk Management). The approach presents activities to structure RM in SPL projects, The design of the RiPLE-RM approach elaborated on results from empirical investigations, and was proposed to facilitate the management and provide significant insights that can be used to avoid and solve risks.},

This paper presents our experience using this framework in a mid-sized software development company with more than 25 years of experience but without previous experience in product line engineering. This industrial experience, conducted as a qualitative empirical evaluation, helped us to evaluate to what extent APPLIES is practical to be used in a real environment and to gather ideas from real potential users to improve the framework.},

A service mashup is built from existing services such that the developed service mashup offers added-value through new functionalities. We propose an approach which adopts concepts from software product line engineering and automated AI planning to support the automated composition of service mashups. One of the advantages of our work is that it allows non-experts to build and optimize desired mashups with little knowledge of service composition. We report on the results of the experimentation that we have performed which support the practicality and scalability of our proposed work.},

abstract = {Cloning is a general approach to create new functionality within variants as well as new system variants. It is a fast, flexible, intuitive, and economical approach to evolve systems in the short run. However, in the long run, the maintenance effort increases. A common solution to this problem is the extraction of a product line from a set of cloned variants. This process requires a detailed analysis of variants to extract variability information. However, clones within a variant are usually not considered in the process, but are also a cause for unsustainable software. This thesis proposes an extractive multi product-line engineering approach to re-establish the sustainable development of software variants. We propose an approach to re-engineer intra-system and inter-system clones into reusable, configurable components stored in an integrated platform and synthesize a matching multilayer feature model.},

abstract = {Companies considering adopting a product line engineering approach should ideally analyze the pros and cons to determine the sound reasons for this decision. In order to support this analysis, in previous work we proposed the APPLIES evaluation framework. This framework provides information to evaluate the convenience of adopting a product line engineering approach.This paper presents an empirical evaluation of APPLIES. This experience includes 18 potential practitioners that used the framework to evaluate the convenience of adopting product line engineering in 19 different companies. The collected evidence was used to evaluate the perceived usefulness, intention to use and ease of use of APPLIES. The results presented increase confidence that APPLIESis a useful tool, but also identify some possibilities for improvement. In addition, four categories for classifying potential adopters of product line engineering emerged during the analysis of the results: unprepared adopter, potential adopter, ready adopter, and unmotivated adopter. These categories could be useful to classify companies that are considering adopting product line engineering.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a emerging software reuse paradigm. SPLE focuses on systematic software reuse from requirement engineering to product derivation throughout the software development life-cycle. Feature model is one of the most important reusable assets which represents all design considerations of a software product line. Feature model will be used in the product configuration process to produce a software. The product configuration is a decision-making process, where all kinds of relationships among configurable features will be considered to select the desired features for the product. To improve the efficiency and quality of product configuration, we are proposing a new approach which aims at identifying a small set of key features. The product configuration should always start from this set of features since, based on the feature dependencies, the decisions made on these features will imply decisions on the rest of the features of the product line, thus reduce the features visited in the configuration process. We have also conducted some experiments to demonstrate how the proposed approach works and evaluate the efficiency of the approach.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used as a machine learning solution thanks to the complexity of their architecture and hyperparameters-weights. A drawback is the excessive demand for massive computational power during the training process. Not only as a whole but parts of neural networks can also be in charge of certain functionalities. We present a novel challenge in an intersection between machine learning and variability management communities to reuse modules of DNNs without further training. Let us assume that we are given a DNN for image processing that recognizes cats and dogs. By extracting a part of the network, without additional training a new DNN should be divisible with the functionality of recognizing only cats. Existing research in variability management can offer a foundation for a product line of DNNs composing the reusable functionalities. An ideal solution can be evaluated based on its speed, granularity of determined functionalities, and the support for adding variability to the network. The challenge is decomposed in three subchallenges: feature extraction, feature abstraction, and the implementation of a product line of DNNs.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a systematic approach for the development of related software products. These products share a common infrastructure but vary with respect to their individual capabilities, called variabilities. Variability management is a key part of SPLE and is responsible for developing, combining and configuring such variabilities. As these activities are inherently complex, SPLE significantly benefits from tool-support. We developed a customizable Eclipse extension for SPLE that consists of around 38 plug-ins. The resulting tool, called EASy-Producer, extends the Eclipse IDE by the capability to support the creation and management of software product line projects. To provide this capability, EASy-Producer utilizes the extension concepts of the Eclipse platform and integrates additional frameworks, like Xtext. In this paper, we share our experience while applying the Eclipse technologies and, in particular, realizing specific capabilities of our tool using the Eclipse framework. The focus of this paper is on our lessons learned regarding managing workspace information and conflicting build mechanism as well as using Eclipse extensions outside of Eclipse. These lessons serve as an input to the Eclipse community and may help other developers in realizing a complex Eclipse extension.},

Reuse within complex systems usually means reuse of artifacts from different engineering domains such as mechanical, electronics and software engineering. Model-based systems engineering is becoming a standard for systems engineering and collaboration within different domains. This paper presents an exploratory case study on initial efforts of adopting Product Line Engineering practices within the model-based systems engineering process at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE), Sweden. We have used SysML to create overloaded models of the engine systems at Volvo CE. The variability within the engine systems was captured by using the Orthogonal Variability Modeling language. The case study has shown us that overloaded SysML models tend to become complex even on small scale systems, which in turn makes scalability of the approach a major challenge. For successful reuse and to, possibly, tackle scalability, it is necessary to have a database of reusable assets from which product variants can be derived.},

abstract = {Software product-line engineering is arguably one of the most successful methods for establishing large portfolios of software variants in an application domain. However, despite the benefits, establishing a product line requires substantial upfront investments into a software platform with a proper product-line architecture, into new software-engineering processes (domain engineering and application engineering), into business strategies with commercially successful product-line visions and financial planning, as well as into re-organization of development teams. Moreover, establishing a full-fledged product line is not always possible or desired, and thus organizations often adopt product-line engineering only to an extent that deemed necessary or was possible. However, understanding the current state of adoption, namely, the maturity or performance of product-line engineering in an organization, is challenging, while being crucial to steer investments. To this end, several measurement methods have been proposed in the literature, with the most prominent one being the Family Evaluation Framework (FEF), introduced almost two decades ago. Unfortunately, applying it is not straightforward, and the benefits of using it have not been assessed so far. We present an experience report of applying the FEF to nine medium- to large-scale product lines in the avionics domain. We discuss how we tailored and executed the FEF, together with the relevant adaptations and extensions we needed to perform. Specifically, we elicited the data for the FEF assessment with 27 interviews over a period of 11 months. We discuss experiences and assess the benefits of using the FEF, aiming at helping other organizations assessing their practices for engineering their portfolios of software variants.},

abstract = {Feature trees have been the standard data structure for representing product diversity in feature-based systems and software product line engineering (PLE). For basic product lines of modest size or complexity, one or several modular feature trees can be sufficient for managing the and resolving the variation present across the engineering assets in the systems engineering 'V' --- from requirements, to design, through implementation, verification, validation, documentation, and more --- in the software, mechanical, and electrical disciplines. However, enterprises seeking to adopt PLE at all levels of their organization, including areas such as product marketing, portfolio planning, manufacturing, supply chain, product sales, product service and maintenance, Internet-of-Things, resource planning, and much more are finding that thousands of nonengineering users need different views and interaction scenarios with a feature diversity representation. This paper describes a feature ontology (a specification of the meaning of terms in the feature modeling realm) that is suitable for managing the feature-based product line engineering and operations in the largest and most complex product line organizations. This ontology is based on layers of abstraction that each incrementally constrain the complexity and combinatorics and targets specific roles in the organization for greater degrees of efficiency, precision, and automation across an entire business enterprise.},

Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) has also gained attention as a promising and successful software reuse development paradigm over the last decade and proven to provide effective solutions to deal with managing the growing complexity of software systems. Objective: This study aims at characterizing and identifying the existing research on employing and leveraging SO and SPLE. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study to identify and analyze related literature. We identified 81 primary studies, dated from 2000-2011 and classified them with respect to research focus, types of research and contribution. Result: The mapping synthesizes the available evidence about combining the synergy points and integration of SO and SPLE. The analysis shows that the majority of studies focus on service variability modeling and adaptive systems by employing SPLE principles and approaches. In particular, SPLE approaches, especially feature-oriented approaches for variability modeling, have been applied to the design and development of service-oriented systems. While SO is employed in software product line contexts for the realization of product lines to reconcile the flexibility, scalability and dynamism in product derivations thereby creating dynamic software product lines. Conclusion: Our study summarizes and characterizes the SO and SPLE topics researchers have investigated over the past decade and identifies promising research directions as due to the synergy generated by integrating methods and techniques from these two areas.},

The increasing popularity of software product line engineering in the software industry necessitates a process maturity evaluation methodology. Accordingly, this paper presents a business maturity model of software product line, which is a methodology to evaluate the current maturity of the business dimension of a software product line in an organization. This model examines the coordination between product line engineering and the business aspects of software product line. It evaluates the maturity of the business dimension of software product line as a function of how a set of business practices are aligned with product line engineering in an organization. Using the model presented in this paper, we conducted two case studies and reported the assessment results.

abstract = {The engineering of a Software Product Line (SPL), either by creating it from scratch or through the re-engineering of existing variants, it uses to be a project that spans several years with a high investment. It is often hard to analyse and quantify this investment, especially in the context of extractive SPL adoption when the related software variants are independently created by different developers following different system architectures and implementation conventions. This paper reports an experience on the creation of an SPL by re-engineering system variants implemented around an educational game called Robocode. The objective of this game is to program a bot (a battle tank) that battles against the bots of other developers. The world-wide Robocode community creates and maintains a large base of knowledge and implementations that are mainly organized in terms of features, although not presented as an SPL. Therefore, a group of master students analysed this variability-rich domain and extracted a Robocode SPL. We present the results of such extraction augmented with an analysis and a quantification regarding the spent time and effort. We believe that the results and the a-posteriori analysis can provide insights on global challenges on SPL adoption. We also provide all the elements to SPL educators to reproduce the teaching activity, and we make available this SPL to be used for any research purpose.},

The intensity (the frequency and the amount) in which developers change variability information in these different types of artifacts is currently unknown. In this paper, we present a fine-grained approach for the variability-centric extraction and analysis of changes to code, build, and variability model artifacts introduced by commits. This approach complements existing work that is typically based on a feature-perspective and, thus, abstracts from this level of detail. Further, it provides a detailed understanding of the intensity of changes affecting variability information in these types of artifacts. We apply our approach to the Linux kernel revealing that changes to variability information occur infrequently and only affect small parts of the analyzed artifacts. Further, we outline how these results may improve certain analysis and verification tasks during SPL evolution.},

abstract = {In recent years, manufacturing technology is evolving and progressively becoming more dynamic and complex. This means that manufacturing technology (e.g., based on Industry 4.0) should be able to control the production process at runtime by monitoring physical elements and adapting itself. Such functionality is aimed at increasing production effectiveness and reducing the production cost. We argue that monitoring process can be viewed as a software product line having commonalities and variability. To support our argument, we analyzed and conducted domain analysis of two monitoring systems of Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPSs) from two industrial domains including automated warehouses and press machines. Based on the domain analysis, we present a common solution for monitoring including a software product line. With such product line, a user can configure, monitor, and visualize data of an ICPS at runtime. However, such solution could not handle the dynamic functionality related to monitoring of ICPS. Thus, we propose the use of dynamic product line and present a set of research questions that must be addressed for such solution.},

abstract = {The specification of a family of software products may include documents written in natural language. Automatically extracting knowledge from these documents is a challenging problem that requires using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This knowledge can be formalized as a Feature Model (FM), a diagram capturing the key features and the relationships among them.In this paper, we first review previous works that have presented tools for extracting FMs from textual specifications and compare their strengths and limitations. Then, we propose a framework for feature and relationship extraction, which overcomes the identified limitations and is built upon state-of-the-art open-source NLP tools. This framework is evaluated against previous works using several case studies, showing improved results.},

abstract = {Many organizations developing software-intensive systems face challenges with high product complexity and large numbers of variants. In order to effectively maintain and develop these product variants, Product-Line Engineering methods are often considered, while Model-based Systems Engineering practices are commonly utilized to tackle product complexity. In this paper, we report on an industrial case study concerning the ongoing adoption of Product Line Engineering in the Model-based Systems Engineering environment at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) in Sweden. In the study, we identify and define a Product Line Engineering process that is aligned with Model-based Systems Engineering activities at the engines control department of Volvo CE. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of the migration from the current development process to a Model-based Product Line Engineering-oriented process. This process, and its implications, are derived by conducting and analyzing interviews with Volvo CE employees, inspecting artifacts and documents, and by means of participant observation. Based on the results of a first system model iteration, we were able to document how Model-based Systems Engineering and variability modeling will affect development activities, work products and stakeholders of the work products.},

abstract = {A  Software Product Line  (SPL) is a set of similar software systems that share a common set of features satisfying a particular domain, and are built from a shared set of software assets using a common means of production. This research proposes to integrate performance analysis in the early phases of the model-driven development process of SPL. We start by adding generic performance annotations to the UML model representing the set of core reusable SPL assets using the MARTE Profile adopted by OMG. A model transformation realized in Atlas Transformation Language (ATL), derives the UML model of a specific product with concrete performance annotations from the SPL model, which is further transformed into a performance model by using a previously developed transformation called PUMA. The automatic derivation of a specific product model based on a given feature configuration is enabled through the mapping between features from the feature model and their realizations in the design model. An efficient mapping technique is proposed that aims to minimize the amount of explicit feature annotations in the UML model of SPL. Implicit feature mapping is inferred during product derivation from the relationships between annotated and non-annotated model elements as defined in the UML metamodel. The mapping technique is used to derive automatically a given product model. Performance is a run-time property of the deployed system and depends on other factors that are external to the design model, characterizing the underlying platforms and run-time environment. Performance completions provide a means to extend the modeling constructs of a system by including the influence of these factors. The variability space of the performance completions is covered and represented through Performance Completion-feature model (PC-feature model). Dealing manually with a large number of performance parameters annotating a UML+MARTE product model is an error-prone process. A model-driven user-friendly technique is proposed to automatically collect all generic performance parameters that need binding from the generated product model and present them to developers in a spreadsheet format, together with context and guiding information where each PC-feature is mapped to certain MARTE annotations corresponding to UML model elements in the product model.},

abstract = {Software architecture has been a key research area in the software engineering community due to its significant role in creating high-quality software. The trend of developing product lines rather than single products has made the software product line a viable option in the industry. Software product line architecture (SPLA) is regarded as one of the crucial components in the product lines, since all of the resulting products share this common architecture. The increased popularity of software product lines demands a process maturity evaluation methodology. Consequently, this paper presents an architecture process maturity model for software product line engineering to evaluate the current maturity of the product line architecture development process in an organization. Assessment questionnaires and a rating methodology comprise the framework of this model. The objective of the questionnaires is to collect information about the SPLA development process. Thus, in general this work contributes towards the establishment of a comprehensive and unified strategy for the process maturity evaluation of software product line engineering. Furthermore, we conducted two case studies and reported the assessment results, which show the maturity of the architecture development process in two organizations.},

abstract = {The importance of experimentation for Software Engineering research has been notably established in the last years. The software engineering community has discussed how to proper report and evaluate experiments using different approaches, such as quality criteria, scales, and checklists. Nevertheless, there are no guidelines to support researchers and practitioners active in straightforward software engineering research areas, as in Software Product Lines (SPL), at conducting experiments. We hypothesize that experimentation guidelines may aid such a specific area by providing advice and actual excerpts reflecting good practices of SPL experimentation, thus experimentally evolving this area. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to provide guidelines for properly reporting and promoting SPL experiments. We defined such guidelines based on well-known software engineering experiment reports, quality evaluation checklists, and data extracted from 211 SPL experiments identified in a systematic mapping study. We evaluated the guidelines with a qualitative study with SPL and experimentation experts applying open and axial coding procedures. The evaluation enabled us to improve the guidelines. The resulting guidelines contain specific advice to researchers active in SPL and provide examples taken from published SPL experiments. The experts’ positive points indicate that the proposed guidelines can aid SPL researchers and practitioners. Sharing the resulting guidelines could support conducting SPL experiments and allow further area evolution based on prospective experiment replications and reproductions from well-designed and reported experiments.},

abstract = {Early generation Software Product Line (SPL) engineering has evolved into Systems and Software Product Line Engineering (PLE) approaches that extend well beyond the original focus on source code, to a more holistic perspective of the engineering lifecycle. PLE tools and methods in commercial practice today support variation management in requirements, architecture, design models, source code, documentation, configuration data, test cases and more. One of the last lifecycle holdouts from PLE has been mechanical engineering, or Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). The engineering complexity of mechanical product families with embedded software has increased to a threshold where it is intractable for mechanical and software product line engineering to remain disjoint. This paper explores the convergence of mechanical, systems and software product line engineering and why it has been slow to emerge. The reasons are based both on conceptual misalignment among the traditionally distinct disciplines, as well the differences between the physics of mechanical and software systems. The Aras Innovator / BigLever Gears Bridge, an example PLM and PLE integration, is used to illustrate key concepts.},

abstract = {Green computing and energy-aware software engineering are trend approaches that try to address the development of applications respectful with the environment. To reduce the energy consumption of an application the developer needs: (i) to identify what are the concerns that will impact more in the energy consumption; (ii) to model the variability of alternative designs and implementations of each concern; (iii) to store and compare the experimentation results related with the energy and time consumption of concerns; (iv) to find out what is the most eco-efficient solution for each concern. HADAS addresses these issues by modelling the variability of energy consuming concerns for different energy contexts. It connects the variability model with a repository that stores energy measurements, providing a Software Product Line (SPL) service, helping developers to reason and find out what are the most eco-friendly configurations. We have an initial implementation of the HADAS toolkit using Clafer. We have tested our implementation with several case studies.},

abstract = {Feature Models encapsulate functionalities and quality properties of a product family. The employment of feature models for managing variability and commonality of large-scale product families raises an important question: on what basis should the features of a product family be selected for a target software application, which is going to be derived from the product family. Thus, the selection of the most suitable features for a specific application requires the understanding of its stakeholders' intentions and also the relationship between their intentions and the available software features. To address this important issue, we adopt a standard goal-oriented requirements engineering framework, i.e., the i* framework, for identifying stakeholders' intentions and propose an approach for explicitly mapping and bridging between the features of a product family and the goals and objectives of the stakeholders. We propose a novel approach to automatically preconfigure a given feature model based on the objectives of the target product stakeholders. Also, our approach is able to elucidate the rationale behind the selection of the most important features of a family for a target application.},

abstract = {Variability models are used to build configurators. Configurators are programs that guide users through the configuration process to reach a desired configuration that fulfils user requirements. The same variability model can be used to design different configurators employing different techniques. One of the elements that can change in a configurator is the configuration workflow, i.e., the order and sequence in which the different configuration elements are presented to the configuration stakeholders. When developing a configurator, a challenge is to decide the configuration workflow that better suites stakeholders according to previous configurations. For example, when configuring a Linux distribution, the configuration process start by choosing the network or the graphic card, and then other packages with respect to a given sequence. In this paper, we present COnfiguration workfLOw proceSS mIning (COLOSSI), an automated technique that given a set of logs of previous configurations and a variability model can automatically assist to determine the configuration workflow that better fits the configuration logs generated by user activities. The technique is based on process discovery, commonly used in the process mining area, with an adaptation to configuration contexts. Our proposal is validated using existing data from an ERP configuration environment showing its feasibility. Furthermore, we open the door to new applications of process mining techniques in different areas of software product line engineering.},

In the FSW domain, there exists a significant amount of variability in the required capabilities. For example, some FSW have a significant amount of hardware to control and operate in a nearly autonomous fashion. In contrast, other FSW have a small amount of hardware to control and rely heavily of commanding from the ground station to operate the spacecraft. The underlying architecture and component interactions needed for the different FSWs are quite different. This amount of architectural variability makes it difficult to develop a SPL architecture that covers the all possible variability in the FSW domain. Therefore, this paper presents a practical solution to this real world problem that leverages software product line concepts and software architectural design patterns.},

abstract = {Supercomputing centers, typically non-profit, government or university-based organizations with scarce resources, are increasingly being requested to provide customized web portals for user-centered access to their services in order to support a demanding customer base. These portals often have very similar architectures and meet similar requirements, with the variations primarily being in the specialized analysis applications, and in the input and output of these applications. Given these characteristics, Software Production Line Engineering (SPLE) approaches will be valuable in enabling development teams to cost-effectively meet demands. In this paper, we demonstrate a suite of web portals developed at The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) by applying SPLE methodologies. We show how we applied feature modeling on these applications to identify commonalities in their application level features despite differences in their problem domains. We describe a common framework (we term it Per User DrupaL, or PUDL), which serves as the common foundation for these portals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPLE in terms of reduced development time and effort, and discuss the technical challenges faced in this process. Finally we propose, as an extension to our work, an automation framework for portal generation, which users could build their own customized portals.},

abstract = {Developing variant-rich software systems through the application of the software product line approach requires the management of a wide set of requirements. However, in most cases, the focus of those requirements is limited to the functional requirements. The non-functional requirements are often informally defined and their management does not provide traceability mechanisms for their validation. In this paper, we present a multimodel approach that allows the explicit representation of non-functional requirements for software product lines both at domain engineering, and application engineering levels. The multimodel allows the representation of different viewpoints of a software product line, including the non-functional requirements and the relationships that these non-functional requirements might have with features and functionalities. The feasibility of this approach is illustrated through a specific example from the automotive domain.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is an inter-disciplinary concept. It spans the dimensions of business, architecture, process, and the organization. Some of the potential benefits of this approach include cost reduction, improvements in product quality and a decrease in product development time. The increasing popularity of software product line engineering in the software industry necessitates a process maturity evaluation methodology. Accordingly, this paper presents an organizational maturity model of software product line engineering for evaluating the maturity of organizational dimension. The model assumes that organizational theories, behavior, and management play a critical role in the institutionalization of software product line engineering within an organization. Assessment questionnaires and a rating methodology comprise the framework of this model. The objective and design of the questionnaires are to collect information about the software product line engineering process from the dual perspectives of organizational behavior and management. Furthermore, we conducted two case studies and reported the assessment results using the organizational maturity model presented in this paper.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) is a software development approach that systematically applies reuse of artifacts in a specific domain. In the last years, the industry has increasingly required the support of tools for most SPL life cycle activities, targeting feature models and related diagrams, variability management and SPL specific products configuration. However, existing literature does not present any tools with native support to UML-based SPLs. In addition, relying on manipulating XMI files for general-purpose UML tools for such SPLs takes significant effort, and it is time-consuming and error-prone. In this scenario, we developed SMartyModeling, with support to UML stereotype-based variability management. To evolve our tool, we evaluated it throughout a survey answered by 37 participants. We adopted questions from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the System Usability Scale (SUS). We organized it into three sections of Likert-scaled questions for usefulness, ease of use, and usability. A last section consisted of open questions focused on positive and negative aspects and an overview of the evalaution. SMartyModeling was well evaluated in relation to usefulness, ease of use, and usability. We analyzed and interpreted the respondents quotes using correlation techniques and open and axial coding. The analysis of open questions allowed us a direct identification of points to improve the tool, its limitations and positive aspects.},

abstract = {A number of product-line analysis approaches lift analyses such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving from the level of single programs to the level of product lines. These approaches share concepts and mechanisms that suggest an unexplored potential for reuse of key analysis steps and properties, implementation, and verification efforts. Despite the availability of taxonomies synthesizing such approaches, there still remains the underlying problem of not being able to describe product-line analyses and their properties precisely and uniformly. We propose a formal framework that models product-line analyses in a compositional manner, providing an overall understanding of the space of family-based, feature-based, and product-based analysis strategies. It defines precisely how the different types of product-line analyses compose and inter-relate. To ensure soundness, we formalize the framework, providing mechanized specification and proofs of key concepts and properties of the individual analyses. The formalization provides unambiguous definitions of domain terminology and assumptions as well as solid evidence of key properties based on rigorous formal proofs. To qualitatively assess the generality of the framework, we discuss to what extent it describes five representative product-line analyses targeting the following properties: safety, performance, dataflow facts, security, and functional program properties.},

abstract = {Safety-critical software systems are in many cases designed and implemented as families of products, usually referred to as Software Product Lines (SPLs). Products within an SPL vary from each other in terms of which features they include. Applying existing analysis techniques to SPLs and their safety cases is usually challenging because of the potentially exponential number of products with respect to the number of supported features. In this paper, we present a methodology and infrastructure for certified lifting of existing single-product safety analyses to product lines. To ensure certified safety of our infrastructure, we implement it in an interactive theorem prover, including formal definitions, lemmas, correctness criteria theorems, and proofs.We apply this infrastructure to formalize and lift a Change Impact Assessment (CIA) algorithm. We present a formal definition of the lifted algorithm, outline its correctness proof (with the full machine-checked proof available online), and discuss its implementation within a model management framework.},

The correct identification of similarities between different products can be a time-intensive task. Hence, this paper proposes an automated semantical similarity analysis supporting software product line extraction and maintenance. Under the assumption of an already identified compatible interface, the degree of semantical similarity is identified based on provided test cases. Therefore, the analysis can also be applied in a test-driven development. This is done by translating available test sequences for both components into two I/O extended finite automata and performing an abstraction of the defined behavior until a simulation relation is established. The test-based approach avoids complexity issues regarding the state space explosion problem, a common issue in model checking. The proposed approach is applied on different variants and versions of industrially used software components provided by an automotive supplier to demonstrate the method's applicability.},

abstract = {Software and systems product line engineering (PLE) has been an established approach for reducing time to market as well as cost and increasing quality in a set of related products for two decades now. Although there is a huge body of knowledge on PLE, adopting a concrete PLE approach is still not a trivial endeavor for interested companies. With the increasing importance of development speed, the advent of agile engineering approaches, and decreasing management interest in improvements that require large organizational transformations and only show benefits after several years, companies are facing challenges in successfully adopting this approach. They often hesitate as there is no clear adoption path, nor any certainty, that the intended improvement steps will also provide added value in the short- and mid-term perspective. In consequence, a considerable amount of PLE potential still remains unexploited.To help such companies with the adoption of PLE, the goal of this paper is to provide inspiration and evidence that PLE is a sound approach and its successful introduction is possible even in settings that differ substantially from those of pioneer product lines.To this end, this paper presents the following main contributions with the PLE adoption case at Danfoss Drives: an overview of the key change drivers and the motivation for adopting a PLE approach, a discussion of incremental PLE introduction in an agile engineering context, a presentation of the current PLE setting with a focus on key concepts, and finally a presentation of motivators and directions for future improvements.},

abstract = {Extensive maintenance leads to the Software Product Line Architecture (PLA) degradation over time. When there is the need of evolving the Software Product Line (SPL) to include new features, or move to a new platform, a degraded PLA requires considerable effort to understand and modify, demanding expensive refactoring activity. In the state of the art, search-based algorithms are used to improve PLA at package level. However, recent studies have shown that the most variability and implementation details of an SPL are described in the level of classes. There is a gap between existing approaches and existing practical needs. In this work, we extend the current state of the art to deal with feature modularization in the level of classes by introducing a new search operator and a set of objective functions to deal with feature modularization in a finer granularity of the architectural elements, namely at class level. We evaluated the proposal in an exploratory study with a PLA widely investigated and a real-world PLA. The results of quantitative and qualitative analysis point out that our proposal provides solutions to properly re-modularize features in a PLA, being preferred by practitioners, in order to support the evolution of SPLs.},

abstract = {Automotive manufacturing ranks among the most extreme instances of systems and software product line engineering (PLE). The product family numbers in the millions, each product is highly complex in its own right, and the variation across products is literally astronomical in scale. This paper explores the aspects that make the domain extreme and the very specific implications they have for PLE. These implications include the need for efficient manufacturing, complexity management, concurrent development streams, globally distributed engineering and production, a hierarchical product family tree, multi-level variation binding, constraint management, and a highly robust and integrated PLE tooling environment. Happily, the PLE paradigm supporting these implications brings about a number of opportunities for analysis and automation that provide efficiencies of production previously unattainable. We focus on one example in depth: The management and automated generation of the many thousands of calibration parameters that determine vehicle-specific software behavior. Throughout, we use the vehicle product line at General Motors, which we believe to be the world's largest, to illustrate and ground our journey through automotive PLE.},

While this paradigm has been successfully applied for the development of embedded systems in various domains, new challenges have emerged from the development of safety critical systems that require certification against a specific standard. Existing SPLE approaches do not explicitly consider the various certification standards or levels that products should satisfy. In this paper, we focus on several practical issues involved in the SPLE process, establishing an infrastructure of a product line engineering for certified products. A metamodel is proposed to capture the entities involved in SPL certification and the relationships among them.

This article proposes a portfolio-driven development method and its management method of APLE (Agile Product Line Engineering). The proposed method is intended to manage agile evolution of multiple product lines while increasing variability of products. To establish a portfolio management of development resources, it is necessary for an organization to manage multiple product lines on APLE in an entire development. We propose a portfolio-driven development method of three layers on APLE and its management method based on a concept of portfolio management life cycle. We applied the proposed management model and method to the multiple product lines of automotive software systems, and demonstrated an improvement of manageability with better predictability of both productivity and development size. This article contributes to provide an entire development management method for APLE, and its practical experience in the automotive multiple product lines.},

abstract = {Product line engineering comprises many heterogeneous activities such as capturing the variability of reusable assets, supporting the derivation of products from the product line, evolving the product line, or tailoring the approach to the specifics of a domain. The inherent complexity of product lines implicates that tool support is inevitable to facilitate smooth performance and to avoid costly errors. Product line engineering tools have to support heterogeneous stakeholders involved in diverse activities. Tool integration therefore is of particular importance to foster their seamless cooperation. However, the integration is difficult to achieve due to the diversity of models and work products. This paper describes the DOPLER tool suite which has been developed to provide such integrated support. The tool suite is flexible and extensible to support domain-specific needs},

We assessed the research type of the papers (academic or industry), the kind of evaluation (application example, empirical, etc.), and the application domain. Also, we assessed which product line life-cycle phases, development practices, and topics the papers address. We present an analysis of the topics covered by academic vs. industry research and discuss the evolution of these topics and their relation over the years. We also discuss implications for researchers and practitioners. We conclude that even though several topics have received more attention than others, academic and industry research on software product lines are actually rather in line with each other.},

abstract = {Nuclear power plants are some of the most sophisticated and complex energy systems ever designed. These systems perform safety critical functions and must conform to national safety institutions and international regulations. In many cases, regulatory documents provide very high level and ambiguous requirements that leave a large margin for interpretation. As the French nuclear industry is now seeking to spread its activities outside France, it is but necessary to master the ins and the outs of the variability between countries safety culture and regulations. This sets both an industrial and a scientific challenge to introduce and propose a product line engineering approach to an unaware industry whose safety culture is made of interpretations, specificities, and exceptions.This paper presents our current work within the French R&amp;D project CONNEXION, while introducing variability modeling to the French nuclear industry. In particular, we discuss the background, the quest for the best variability paradigm, the practical modeling of requirements variability as well as the mapping between variable requirements and variable architecture elements.},

abstract = {Companies that develop similar software systems often transition from single-system development to software product line development. In this transition, reusable assets are identified and incrementally created over a period of time. Bottom-up Software Product Line Engineering approaches aid stakeholders to identify variability from the legacy artifacts. One of these artifacts is the legacy source code. In this paper, we contribute the Collaboration and Source Code Driven Bottom-up approach, with two main enhancements. We apply clone detection and architecture reengineering techniques for identifying variability from the legacy artifacts. These techniques which have been traditionally used for maintaining software are now used for identifying variability and analyze code coupling and cohesion from the legacy code. Our second enhancement is improving stakeholder collaboration by guiding the domain experts in order to decide on variability. In particular, we apply Questions, Options and Criteria technique for capturing rationale and supporting collaboration.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a set of industrial software-intensive systems for configuring similar software products in which personalized feature sets are configured by different business teams. The integration of these feature sets can generate inconsistencies that are typically resolved through manual deliberation. This is a time-consuming process and leads to a potential loss of business resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can provide the best solution to address this issue autonomously through more efficient configurations, lesser inconsistencies and optimized resources. This paper presents the first literature review of both research and industrial AI applications to SPL configuration issues. Our results reveal only 19 relevant research works which employ traditional AI techniques on small feature sets with no real-life testing or application in industry. We categorize these works in a typology by identifying 8 perspectives of SPL. We also show that only 2 standard industrial SPL tools employ AI in a limited way to resolve inconsistencies. To inject more interest and application in this domain, we motivate and present future research directions. Particularly, using real-world SPL data, we demonstrate how predictive analytics (a state of the art AI technique) can separately model inconsistent and consistent patterns, and then predict inconsistencies in advance to help SPL designers during the configuration of a product. Literature review of AI applications to SPL configuration issuesDevelop a taxonomy based on eight different problem domainsThis review shows use of logic, constraint satisfaction, reasoning, ontology and optimization.Several important future research directions are proposed.We justify advanced analytics and swarm intelligence as better future applications.},

abstract = {Developing software from scratch is a high cost and error-prone activity. A possible solution to reduce time-to-market and produce high quality software is the reuse of existing software. But when the number of features in the system grows, the maintenance becomes more complex. In such cases, to adopt a systematic approach, such as Software Product Line Engineering, is necessary. Existing systems are generally migrated to a product line, allowing systematic reuse of artefacts and easing maintenance. To this end, some approaches have been proposed in the literature in the last years. A mapping of works on this subject and the identification of some research gaps can lead to an improvement of such approaches. This paper describes the main outcomes of a systematic mapping study on the evolution and migration of systems to SPL. The main works found are presented and classified according to adopted strategy, artefacts used, and evaluation conducted. Analysis of the evolution along the past years are also presented. At the end, we summarize some trends and open issues to serve as reference to new researches.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is a compelling methodology that accomplishes systematic reuse in families of systems by relying on two key principles: (i) the decomposition of complex systems into composable and reusable building blocks (often logical units called features), and (ii) on-demand construction of products and product variants by composing these building blocks.However, unless the stakeholder responsible for product configuration has detailed knowledge of the technical ins and outs of the software product line (e.g., the architectural impact of a specific feature, or potential feature interactions), he is in many cases flying in the dark. Although many initial approaches and techniques have been proposed that take into account quality considerations and involve trade-off decisions during product configuration, no systematic support exists.In this paper, we present a reference architecture for product configuration tooling, providing support for (i) up-front generation of variants, and (ii) quality analysis of these variants. This allows pro-actively assessing and predicting architectural quality properties for each product variant and in turn, product configuration tools can take into account architectural considerations. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of techniques and tactics for dealing with the problem of variant explosion, and as such to maintain practical feasibility of such approaches.We validated and implemented our reference architecture in the context of a real-world industrial application, a product-line for the firmware of an automotive sensor. Our prototype, based on FeatureIDE, is open for extension and readily available.},

Variability management capabilities can be included in the co-simulation tool itself or provide variability mechanisms to configure the co-simulation externally from a software product line. Depending on the context, one or even both scenarios can be applied.This work addresses different types of variability in an independent co-simulation framework (ICOS) and defines requirements for a realization concept.},

abstract = {Handling large-scale software variability is still a challenge for many organizations. After decades of research on variability management concepts, many industrial organizations have introduced techniques known from research, but still lament that pure textbook approaches are not applicable or efficient. For instance, software product line engineering—an approach to systematically develop portfolios of products—is difficult to adopt given the high upfront investments; and even when adopted, organizations are challenged by evolving their complex product lines. Consequently, the research community now mainly focuses on re-engineering and evolution techniques for product lines; yet, understanding the current state of adoption and the industrial challenges for organizations is necessary to conceive effective techniques. In this multiple-case study, we analyze the current adoption of variability management techniques in twelve medium- to large-scale industrial cases in domains such as automotive, aerospace or railway systems. We identify the current state of variability management, emphasizing the techniques and concepts they adopted. We elicit the needs and challenges expressed for these cases, triangulated with results from a literature review. We believe our results help to understand the current state of adoption and shed light on gaps to address in industrial practice.},

abstract = {The development process in software product line engineering is divided into domain engineering and application engineering. As a consequence of this division, tests should be performed in both processes. However, existing testing techniques for single systems cannot be applied during domain engineering, because of the variability in the domain artifacts. Existing software product line test techniques only cover unit and system tests. Our contribution is a model-based, automated integration test technique that can be applied during domain engineering. For generating integration test case scenarios, the technique abstracts from variability and assumes that placeholders are created for variability. The generated scenarios cover all interactions between the integrated components, which are specified in a test model. Additionally, the technique reduces the effort for creating placeholders by minimizing the number of placeholders needed to execute the integration test case scenarios. We have experimentally measured the performance of the technique and the potential reduction of placeholders.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) deals with developing artifacts that capture the common and variable aspects of software product families. Domain models are one kind of such artifacts. Being developed in early stages, domain models need to specify commonality and variability and guide the reuse of the artifacts in particular software products. Although different modeling methods have been proposed to manage and support these activities, the assessment of these methods is still in an inceptive stage. In this work, we examined the comprehensibility of domain models specified in ADOM, a UML-based SPLE method. In particular, we conducted a controlled experiment in which 116 undergraduate students were required to answer comprehension questions regarding a domain model that was equipped with explicit reuse guidance and/or variability specification. We found that explicit specification of reuse guidance within the domain model helped understand the model, whereas explicit specification of variability increased comprehensibility only to a limited extent. Explicit specification of both reuse guidance and variability often provided intermediate results, namely, results that were better than specification of variability without reuse guidance, but worse than specification of reuse guidance without variability. All these results were perceived in different UML diagram types, namely, use case, class, and sequence diagrams and for different commonality-, variability-, and reuse-related aspects.},

abstract = {Testing software product lines (SPLs) is very challenging due to a high degree of variability leading to an enormous number of possible products. The vast majority of today's testing approaches for SPLs validate products individually using different kinds of reuse techniques for testing. Because of their reusability and adaptability capabilities, model-based approaches are suitable to describe variability and are therefore frequently used for implementation and testing purposes of SPLs. Due to the enormous number of possible products, individual product testing becomes more and more infeasible. Pairwise testing offers one possibility to test a subset of all possible products. However, according to the best of our knowledge, there is no contribution discussing and rating this approach in the SPL context. In this contribution, we provide a mapping between feature models describing the common and variable parts of an SPL and a reusable test model in the form of statecharts. Thereby, we interrelate feature model-based coverage criteria and test model-based coverage criteria such as control and data flow coverage and are therefore able to discuss the potentials and limitations of pairwise testing. We pay particular attention to test requirements for feature interactions constituting a major challenge in SPL engineering. We give a concise definition of feature dependencies and feature interactions from a testing point of view, and we discuss adequacy criteria for SPL coverage under pairwise feature interaction testing and give a generalization to the T-wise case. The concept and implementation of our approach are evaluated by means of a case study from the automotive domain.},

abstract = {Context: During the definition of software product lines (SPLs) it is necessary to choose the components that appropriately fulfil a product's intended functionalities, including its quality requirements (i.e., security, performance, scalability). The selection of the appropriate set of assets from many possible combinations is usually done manually, turning this process into a complex, time-consuming, and error-prone task. Objective: Our main objective is to determine whether, with the use of modeling tools, we can simplify and automate the definition process of a SPL, improving the selection process of reusable assets. Method: We developed a model-driven strategy based on the identification of critical points (sensitivity points) inside the SPL architecture. This strategy automatically selects the components that appropriately match the product's functional and quality requirements. We validated our approach experimenting with different real configuration and derivation scenarios in a mobile healthcare SPL where we have worked during the last three years. Results: Through our SPL experiment, we established that our approach improved in nearly 98% the selection of reusable assets when compared with the unassisted analysis selection. However, using our approach there is an increment in the time required for the configuration corresponding to the learning curve of the proposed tools. Conclusion: We can conclude that our domain-specific modeling approach significantly improves the software architect's decision making when selecting the most suitable combinations of reusable components in the context of a SPL.},

We propose a novel method and a tool for visualization and exploration of a multi-dimensional space of optimal variants (i.e., a Pareto front). The visualization method is an integrated, interactive, and synchronized set of complementary views onto a Pareto front specifically designed to support PLE scenarios, including: understanding differences among variants and their positioning with respect to quality dimensions; solving trade-offs; selecting the most desirable variants; and understanding the impact of changes during product line evolution on a variant's qualities.

One challenge with these estimates is that there are inaccuracies due to uncertainty in the environment or accuracy of measurement. This may result in issues ranging from suboptimal plans to infeasible plans.Objective: To address the above, we propose to include uncertainty as part of the SPL scoping model. Plans developed in consideration of uncertainty would be more robust against possible fluctuations in estimates.Approach: In this paper, a method to incorporate uncertainty in scoping optimization and its application to generate robust solutions is proposed. We capture uncertainty as part of the formulation and model scoping optimization as a multi-objective problem with profit and stability as fitness functions. Profit stability and feasibility stability are considered to represent stability concerns.Results: Results show that, compared to other scope optimization approaches, both performance stability and feasibility stability are improved while maintaining near optimal performance for profit objective. Also, generated results consist of solutions with trade-offs between profit and stability, providing the decision maker with enhanced decision support.Conclusion: Multi-objective optimization with stability consideration for SPL scoping provides project managers with a robust and flexible way to address uncertainty in the process of SPL scoping. HighlightsA robust multi-objective optimization approach for SPL scoping is proposed.Two types of stability are considered: performance stability and feasibility stability.Approach was able to find plans with higher stability.},

abstract = {The process of Developing Software Product Line Architectures can be a complex task. However, the use of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques can facilitate the development of SPLAs by introducing Domain Specific Languages, Graphical Editors, and Generators. Together these are considered the sacred triad of MDE. Key to understanding MDE and how it fits into SPLAs is to know exactly what each part of the trinity means, how it relates to the other parts, and what the various implementations are for each. This tutorial will demonstrate the use of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and Eclipse's Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) to create an actual MDE solution as applied to a sample SPLA. These tools collectively form what is called a Language Workbench. During this tutorial we will also illustrate how to model the visual artifacts of our Domain Model and generate a Domain Specific Graphical Editor using GMF.This tutorial has its foundations in years of industrial experience with large and complex SPLAs in various industries. This tutorial continues to be updated each year to include recent and critical innovations in MDE and SPL. This year will include information on key Model Transformation, Constraints and Textual Modeling Languages targeted at Software Product Lines. Additionally, it will cover advances in Software Product Line migration technologies which include techniques as to how to effectively migrate legacy systems toward and MDE/SPLA architecture and implementation. This year's tutorial includes extensive industrial experience on the testing of large and complex SPLAs.The goal of this tutorial is to educate attendees on what MDE technologies are, how exactly they relate synergistically to Software Product Line Architectures, and how to actually apply them using an existing Eclipse implementation.The benefits of the technology are so far reaching that we feel the intended audience spans technical managers, developers and CTOs. In general the target audience includes researchers and practitioners who are working on problems related to the design and implementation of SPLAs and would like to understand the benefits of applying MDE techniques towards SPLAs and leverage Eclipse as a framework to develop MDE solutions. The first half will be less technical than the second half where we cover the details of SPLA and MDE in action in complete detail showing patterns and code.},

Hence the integration of mobility that facilitates access to games. A learner focuses on training through the accessibility at all times, the quality of content, and the particularity and difference of the scenarios. The valorization of the use of Mobile Serious Games (MSG) requires the adoption of an approach. We have started our study by detecting the characteristics influencing the attachment of a learner, thereafter, we have studied the advantages of mobility in our connected society, then, we have explored the Software Product Line (SPL) modeling approach that presents the most appropriate solution to solve our problematic. Finally, we have treated the notion of variability. This concept allows the detection of common and variable points between the products of the set. This will then facilitate the modeling of serious games.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineering is increasingly being adopted in safety-critical systems. It is highly desirable to rigorously show that these systems are designed correctly. However, formal analysis for SPLs is more difficult than for single systems because an SPL may contain a large number of individual systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient model-checking technique for SPLs using induction and a SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) solver. We show how an induction-based verification method can be adapted to the SPLs, with the help of a SAT solver. To combat the state space explosion problem, a novel technique that exploits the distinguishing characteristics of SPLs, called feature cube enlargement, is proposed to reduce the verification efforts. The incremental SAT mechanism is applied to further improve the efficiency. The correctness of our technique is proved. Experimental results show dramatic improvement of our technique over the existing binary decision diagram (BDD)-based techniques.},

abstract = {Live Training Transformation (LT2) is the product line strategy put in place by the United States Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI). The purpose of the LT2 product line is to provide a common set of core assets including architectures, software components, standards and processes that form the basis of all Army Live Training systems. As products consuming LT2 core assets evolve to meet the latest requirements of the military live training community, changes to the core product line architecture must also be made. Based on thorough analysis of the LT2 core capabilities and user trends toward web-enabled and mobile computing technologies, a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) strategy was identified and adopted as the objective architecture for the evolving LT2 product line. Future success of the LT2 product line now depends on the alignment of product line engineering concepts with the business and technical benefits of SOA, and to ensure that systematic reuse continues to provide substantial return-on-investment for the Army. This paper addresses the challenges of adopting SOA into an existing software product line, the unique circumstances of the LT2 SOA environment, and present a set of analysis and design considerations for the product line engineering community.},

abstract = {Software product lines are an engineering approach to systematically build similar software products from a common asset base. When evolving such systems, it is important to have assurance that we are not introducing errors or changing the behavior of existing products. The product line refinement theory establishes the necessary conditions for such assurance. This theory has been specified and proved using the PVS proof assistant. However, the Coq proof assistant is increasingly popular among researchers and practitioners, and, given that some programming languages are already formalized into such tool, the refinement theory might benefit from the potential integration. Therefore, in this work we present a case study on porting the PVS specification of the refinement theory to Coq. We compare the proof assistants based on the noted differences between the specifications and proofs of this theory, providing some reflections on the tactics and strategies used to compose the proofs. According to our study, PVS provided more succinct definitions than Coq, in several cases, as well as a greater number of successful automatic commands that resulted in shorter proofs. Despite that, Coq also brought facilities in definitions such as enumerated and recursive types, and features that support developers in their proofs.},

This cross-organizational distribution of reusable assets leads to numerous challenges, such as inconsistent configuration, costly and time-consuming integration, diverging evolution speed and direction, and inadequate testing.The MultiPLE workshop is aimed at discussing the challenges involved with the development and evolution of multi product lines and the assets used for their production.},

abstract = {The mCRL2 language and supporting software provide a state-of-the-art tool suite for the verification of distributed systems. In this paper, we present the general principles, extrapolated from [7,8], which make us believe that mCRL2 can also be used for behavioral variability analysis of product families. The mCRL2 data language allows to smoothly deal with feature sets and attributes, its process language is sufficiently rich to model feature selection, as well as product behavior based on an FTS-like semantics. Because of the feature-orientation, our modeling strategy allows a natural refactoring of the semantic model of a product family into a parallel composition of components that reflects coherent sets of features. This opens the way for dedicated abstraction and reduction techniques that strengthen the prospect of a scalable verification approach to software product lines. In this paper, we sketch how to model product families in mCRL2 and how to apply a modular verification method, preparing the ground to further assess the scalability of our approach, in particular regarding model checking.},

However, existing search-based design works address only traditional software design not considering intrinsic Software Product Line aspects. This paper presents MOA4PLA, a search-based approach to support the PLA design. It gives a multi-objective treatment to the design problem based on specific PLA metrics. A metamodel to represent the PLA and a novel search operator to improve feature modularization are proposed. Results point out that the application of MOA4PLA leads to PLA designs with well modularized features, contributing to improve features reusability and extensibility. It raises a set of solutions with different design trade-offs that can be used to improve the PLA design.},

The use of design patterns for PLAs is a recent research field, not completely explored yet. Some works apply the patterns manually and for a specific domain. Approaches to search-based PLA design do not consider the usage of these patterns. To allow such use, this paper introduces a mutation operator named “Pattern-Driven Mutation Operator” that includes methods to automatically identify suitable scopes and apply the patterns Strategy, Bridge and Mediator with the search-based approach multi-objective optimization approach for PLA. A metamodel is proposed to represent and identify suitable scopes to receive each one of the patterns, avoiding the introduction of architectural anomalies. Empirical results are also presented, showing evidences that the use of the proposed operator produces a greater diversity of solutions and improves the quality of the PLAs obtained in the search-based optimization process, regarding the values of software metrics.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is an emerging methodology for the development of variant-rich software systems. As software product lines are viable for this purpose, testing them is complicated in contrast to non-variable systems, as there is an increasingly amount of possible products due to the number of features. There exist many methods proposed for testing software product lines, but seldom the quality of the resulting tests was assessed. For assessing test quality mutation analysis is a well-known technique and is frequently applied to non-variable software systems. However, mutation analysis cannot be applied straight-forward onto software product lines.We present a mutation system for assessing the quality of software product line tests by means of fault detection capability. Our mutation system comprises model-based mutation operators, test case adaption, automated model and test execution, and automated mutation analysis. So far, we developed several mutation operators for feature models, UML state machines, and mapping models. We evaluated the mutation operators against tests that were generated from the specifications and applied them for three case studies. From the results we draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the individual mutation operators.},

The objective of the KOPLE workshop series is to bring together SPL researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to investigate the role of Knowledge in PLE.

Nevertheless, KOPLE also aims to become a discussion forum about techniques and methods to convert from tacit to explicit Knowledge in PLE and to process and use this Knowledge for optimizing and innovating PLE processes.},

abstract = {The software system controlling a train is typically deployed on various hardware architectures and must process various signals across those deployments. The increase of such customization scenarios and the needed adherence of the software to various safety standards in different application domains has led to the adoption of product line engineering within the railway domain. This paper explores the current state-of-practice of software product line development within a team developing industrial embedded software for a train propulsion control system.

abstract = {Test prioritization is crucial for testing products in a product line considering limited budget in terms of available time and resources. In general, it is not practically feasible to execute all the possible test cases and so, ordering test case execution permits test engineers to discover faults earlier in the testing process. An efficient prioritization of test cases for one or more products requires a clear consideration of the tradeoff among various costs (e.g., time, required resources) and effectiveness (e.g., feature coverage) objectives. As an integral part of the future Cisco's test scheduling system for validating video conferencing products, we introduce a search-based multi-objective test prioritization technique, considering multiple cost and effectiveness measures. In particular, our multi-objective optimization setup includes the minimization of execution cost (e.g., time), and the maximization of number of prioritized test cases, feature pairwise coverage and fault detection capability. Based on cost-effectiveness measures, a novel fitness function is defined for such test prioritization problem. The fitness function is empirically evaluated together with three commonly used search algorithms (e.g., (1+1) Evolutionary algorithm (EA)) and Random Search as a comparison baseline based on the Cisco's industrial case study and 500 artificial designed problems. The results show that (1+1) EA achieves the best performance for solving the test prioritization problem and it scales up to solve the problems of varying complexity.},

However, sales people and customers do not only care about technical properties of product features during product derivation. They also need information concerning the business value of product features. Existing approaches have addressed this issue by combining business information with variability models, e.g., by defining feature attributes or by integrating third party tools. However, a solution that seamlessly integrates variability and business calculations within a SPLE tool is still lacking. We report on our ongoing efforts to integrate business calculations in the DOPLER tool suite.

abstract = {The selection of optimal test sets for Software Product Lines (SPLs) is a complex task impacted by many factors and that needs to consider the tester's preferences. To help in this task, Preference-based Evolutionary Multi-objective Algorithms (PEMOAs) have been explored. They use a Reference Point (RP), which represents the user preference and guides the search, resulting in a greater number of solutions in the ROI (Region of Interest). This region contains solutions that are more interesting from the tester's point of view. However, the explored PEMOAs have not been compared yet and the results reported in the literature do not consider many-objective formulations. Such an evaluation is important because in the presence of more than three objectives the performance of the algorithms may change and the number of solutions increases. Considering this fact, this work presents evaluation results of four PEMOAs for selection of products in the SPL testing considering cost, testing criteria coverage, products similarity, and the number of revealed faults, given by the mutation score. The PEMOAs present better performance than traditional algorithms, avoiding uninteresting solutions. We introduce a hyper-heuristic version of the PEMOA R-NSGA-II that presents the best results in a general case.},

abstract = {Collection data structures in standard libraries of programming languages are designed to excel for the average case by carefully balancing memory footprint and runtime performance. These implicit design decisions and hard-coded trade-offs do constrain users from using an optimal variant for a given problem. Although a wide range of specialized collections is available for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), they introduce yet another dependency and complicate user adoption by requiring specific Application Program Interfaces (APIs) incompatible with the standard library.  A product line for collection data structures would relieve library designers from optimizing for the general case. Furthermore, a product line allows evolving the potentially large code base of a collection family efficiently. The challenge is to find a small core framework for collection data structures which covers all variations without exhaustively listing them, while supporting good performance at the same time.  We claim that the concept of Array Mapped Tries (AMTs) embodies a high degree of commonality in the sub-domain of immutable collection data structures. AMTs are flexible enough to cover most of the variability, while minimizing code bloat in the generator and the generated code. We implemented a Data Structure Code Generator (DSCG) that emits immutable collections based on an AMT skeleton foundation. The generated data structures outperform competitive hand-optimized implementations, and the generator still allows for customization towards specific workloads.},

abstract = {Display Omitted An architecture to support a SPL for scientific applications.An approach where the semantics is highlighted.Use of ontologies in conjunction with feature models.The implementation of an SSPL.Case studies in the bioinformatics area (sequencing/genetic alignment). ContextMost specialized users (scientists) that use bioinformatics applications do not have suitable training on software development. Software Product Line (SPL) employs the concept of reuse considering that it is defined as a set of systems that are developed from a common set of base artifacts. In some contexts, such as in bioinformatics applications, it is advantageous to develop a collection of related software products, using SPL approach. If software products are similar enough, there is the possibility of predicting their commonalities, differences and then reuse these common features to support the development of new applications in the bioinformatics area. ObjectivesThis paper presents the PL-Science approach which considers the context of SPL and ontology in order to assist scientists to define a scientific experiment, and to specify a workflow that encompasses bioinformatics applications of a given experiment. This paper also focuses on the use of ontologies to enable the use of Software Product Line in biological domains. MethodIn the context of this paper, Scientific Software Product Line (SSPL) differs from the Software Product Line due to the fact that SSPL uses an abstract scientific workflow model. This workflow is defined according to a scientific domain and using this abstract workflow model the products (scientific applications/algorithms) are instantiated. ResultsThrough the use of ontology as a knowledge representation model, we can provide domain restrictions as well as add semantic aspects in order to facilitate the selection and organization of bioinformatics workflows in a Scientific Software Product Line. The use of ontologies enables not only the expression of formal restrictions but also the inferences on these restrictions, considering that a scientific domain needs a formal specification. ConclusionsThis paper presents the development of the PL-Science approach, encompassing a methodology and an infrastructure, and also presents an approach evaluation. This evaluation presents case studies in bioinformatics, which were conducted in two renowned research institutions in Brazil.},

abstract = {Product line test development is more complicated than test development for a single application, as the former has to deal with variability among assets (artifacts) and is carried out in two separate but related development phases, i.e. domain engineering and application engineering. Different software product test development methods provide different opportunities for reuse depending on how variability is represented in the domain test artifacts, when binding is formed and applied and also when test data are determined. This paper compares and analyzes the six major methods for the software product line test development in the literature. Through the comparison, we find out that existing software product line testing methods did not fully consider the aspects of software product line that are essential for reuse in software product line development such as variability representation, binding formation and application time and test data determination time. As the conclusion of this literature review, this paper suggests future research opportunities for software product line testing to explore.},

The functional overlap of such products is an opportunity for future systematic reuse to reduce software development and maintenance costs. Therefore, we have tailored existing domain analysis methods to our organization to identify commonalities and variabilities among such products and to assess the potential for software product line (SPL) approaches. As an exploratory case study, we report on our experiences and lessons learned from conducting the domain analysis in four application cases with large-scale software products. We learned that the outcome of a domain analysis was often a smaller integration scenario instead of an SPL and that business case calculations were less relevant for the stakeholders and managers from the business units during this phase. We also learned that architecture reconstruction using a simple block diagram notation aids domain analysis and that large parts of our approach were reusable across application cases.},

abstract = {Successful Software Product Lines (SPLs) evolve over time. However, one practical problem is that during SPL evolution the core assets, especially the code, tend to become complicated and difficult to understand, use, and maintain. Typically, more and more problems arise over time with implicit or already lost adaptation knowledge about the interdependencies of the different system variants and the supported variability. In this paper, we present a model-based SPL improvement process that analyzes existing large-scale SPL reuse infrastructure to identify improvement potential with respective metrics. Since Conditional Compilation (CC) is one of the most widely used mechanisms to implement variability, we parse variability-related facts from preprocessor code. Then we automatically extract an implementation variability model, including product configuration and variation points that are structured in a hierarchical variability tree. The extraction process is presented with concrete measurement results from an industrial case study.},

Software Product Lines allow organizations to yield high returns on initial investments, better times to market, cut costs and increase profits and increase the ability to enter any market or domain of application, rather quickly, than what has been possible in the past. Software Stability Model, along with the multiple benefits that it brings along with the approach to software architecture, design and development that it incorporates into the development methodology that it follows, is significantly better than the existing concept of software product lines. Benefits of using this model range from moving from a specialized section or sub-section of a domain that a product line targets to a situation where the product line can be made to be applicable in various situations that involve problems spanning across multiple domains, leave alone a specialized section in a specific domain only, to making the product a highly dynamic and evolvable base resource, such that it virtually never fades out or the longevity of the product line itself being increased manifold This work discusses the various benefits that Software Stability has over the regular Product Line Engineering and how some of Software Stability Model's concepts can make the product lines of today, much better.},

However, these might require unaffordable paradigm shifts for developers if the software was not thought at the outset as a product line. Furthermore, these techniques can be conflicting with a company's coding practices or external regulations. These concerns were the motivation for the industry---university collaboration described in this paper in which we developed a minimally intrusive coding technique based on tags.

abstract = {One of the basic principles in product lines is to delay design decisions related to offered functionality and quality to later phases of the life cycle [25]. Instead of deciding on what system to develop in advance, a set of assets and a common reference architecture are specified and implemented during the Domain Engineering process. Later on, during Application Engineering, specific systems are developed to satisfy the requirements reusing the assets and architecture [16]. Traditionally, this is during the Application Engineering when delayed design decisions are solved. The realization of this delay relies heavily on the use of variability in the development of product lines and systems. However, as systems become more interconnected and diverse, software architects cannot easily foresee the software variants and the interconnections between components. Consequently, a generic a priori model is conceived to specify the system's dynamic behaviour and architecture. The corresponding design decisions are left to be solved at runtime [13].Surprisingly, few research initiatives have investigated variability models at runtime [9]. Further, they have been applied only at the level of goals and architecture, which contrasts to the needs claimed by the variability community, i.e., Software Product Lines (SPLC) and Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) [2, 10, 14, 22]. Especially, the vision of DSPL with their ability to support runtime updates with virtually zero downtime for products of a software product line, denotes the obvious need of variability models being used at runtime to adapt the corresponding programs. A main challenge for dealing with runtime variability is that it should support a wide range of product customizations under various scenarios that might be unknown until the execution time, as new product variants can be identified only at runtime [10, 11]. Contemporary variability models face the challenge of representing runtime variability to therefore allow the modification of variation points during the system's execution, and underpin the automation of the system's reconfiguration [15]. The runtime representation of feature models (i.e. the runtime model of features) is required to automate the decision making [9].Software automation and adaptation techniques have traditionally required a priori models for the dynamic behaviour of systems [17]. With the uncertainty present in the scenarios involved, the a priori model is difficult to define [20, 23, 26]. Even if foreseen, its maintenance is labour-intensive and, due to architecture decay, it is also prone to get out-of-date. However, the use of models@runtime does not necessarily require defining the system's behaviour model beforehand. Instead, different techniques such as machine learning, or mining software component interactions from system execution traces can be used to build a model which is in turn used to analyze, plan, and execute adaptations [18], and synthesize emergent software on the fly [7].Another well-known problem posed by the uncertainty that characterize autonomous systems is that different stakeholders (e.g. end users, operators and even developers) may not understand them due to the emergent behaviour. In other words, the running system may surprise its customers and/or developers [4]. The lack of support for explanation in these cases may compromise the trust to stakeholders, who may eventually stop using a system [12, 24]. I speculate that variability models can offer great support for (i) explanation to understand the diversity of the causes and triggers of decisions during execution and their corresponding effects using traceability [5], and (ii) better understand the behaviour of the system and its environment.Further, an extension and potentially reframing of the techniques associated with variability management may be needed to help taming uncertainty and support explanation and understanding of the systems. The use of new techniques such as machine learning exacerbates the current situation. However, at the same time machine learning techniques can also help and be used, for example, to explore the variability space [1]. What can the community do to face the challenges associated?We need to meaningfully incorporate techniques from areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, optimization, planning, decision theory, and bio-inspired computing into our variability management techniques to provide explanation and management of the diversity of decisions, their causes and the effects associated. My own previous work has progressed [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 19, 21] to reflect what was discussed above.},

abstract = {Service-Oriented Architectures are a popular development paradigm to enable distributed applications constructed from independent web services. When coordinated, web services are an infrastructure to fulfill dynamic and vertical integration of business. They may face frequent changes of both requirements and execution environments. Static and predefined service compositions using business process execution language BPEL are not able to cater for such rapid and unpredictable context shifts. The authors propose a variability management-based adaptive and configurable service composition approach that treats changes as first-class citizens and consists of identifying, expressing, realizing, and managing changes of service compositions. The proposed approach is realized with a language called VxBPEL to support variability in service compositions and a platform for design, execution, analysis, and maintenance of VxBPEL-based service compositions. Four case studies validate the feasibility of the proposed approach while exhibiting good performance of the supporting platform.},

abstract = {Dataflow modelling languages such as SCADE or Simulink are the de-facto standard for the Model Driven Development of safety critical embedded control and command systems. Software is mainly being produced by Automated Code Generators whose correctness can only be assessed meaningfully if the input language semantics is well known. These semantics share a common part but are mainly defined through block libraries. The writing of a complete formal specification for the block libraries of the usual languages is highly challenging due to the high variability of the structure and semantics of each block. This contribution relates the use of software product line principles in the design of a domain specific language targeting the formal specification of block libraries. It summarises the advantages of this DSL regarding the writing, validation and formal verification of such specifications. These experiments have been carried out in the context of the GeneAuto embedded code generator project targeting Simulink and Scicos; and are being extended and applied in its follow up projects ProjetP and Hi-MoCo.},

abstract = {Software product lining is the act of providing different but related software products under the same brand, known as a software product line (SPL). As engineering, management and validation of SPLs is far from trivial, special solutions for software product line engineering (SPLE) have a continuous momentum in both academic and industry. In general, it is hard to judge when to reasonably favor SPLE over alternative solutions that are more common in the industry. In this paper, we illustrate how we as Elinvar manage variability within our WealthTech Platform as a Service (PaaS) at different granularity levels, and discuss methods for SPLE in this context. More in detail, we share our techniques and concepts to address configuration management, and show how we manage a single microservice SPL including inter-service communication. Finally, we provide insights into platform solutions by means of packages for our clients. We end with a discussion on SPLE techniques in context of service SPLs and our packaging strategy. We conclude that while we are good to go with industry-standard approaches for microservice SPLs, the variability modeling and analysis advantages within SPLE is promising for our packaging strategy.},

abstract = {In response to the highly competitive market and the pressure to cost-effectively release good-quality software, companies have adopted the concept of software product line to reduce development cost. However, testing and debugging of each product, even from the same family, is still done independently. This can be very expensive. To solve this problem, we need to explore how test cases generated for one product can be used for another product. We propose a genetic algorithm-based framework which integrates software fault localization techniques and focuses on reusing test specifications and input values whenever feasible. Case studies using four software product lines and eight fault localization techniques were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Discussions on factors that may affect the effectiveness of the proposed framework is also presented. Our results indicate that test cases generated in such a way can be easily reused (with appropriate conversion) between different products of the same family and help reduce the overall testing and debugging cost.},

abstract = {Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted HighlightsThe work proposes a hybrid approach to deal with the Product Portfolio Scope Problem.The approach is composed by a solution to deploy the feature relevance indicated by the customers into code assets of a SPL, based on a systematic method (SQFD).The approach includes a method to estimate the cost of an asset based on common and relevant measures related to source code, together with a fuzzy system to deal with the imprecision to set reference values.The work presents an application of an NSGA-II to search for products minimizing the cost and maximizing the relevance of the candidate products.The approach was evaluated using different scenarios, exploring the mains aspects related to method in the practice: size, granularity of features and products search space.The previous version of our hybrid approach was dependent on the employed technologies and algorithms. Herein we reformulate our approach, detaching it from any particular technique/algorithm.The data collection process associated with our approach was improved to facilitate the hybrid approach's usage and mitigate associated construct validity threats.A more comprehensive evaluation, which focused on show the real word usefulness and scalability of our hybrid approach. To validate the usefulness of our approach, it was used the SPL associated with a tool broadly employed in both industrial and academic contexts (ArgoUML-SPL). The scalability of our approach was evaluated using a synthetic SPL.All the experiments were based on the guidelines defined by Arcuri and Briand in order to evaluate the statistical significance of this kind of work. Software product line (SPL) development is a new approach to software engineering which aims at the development of a whole range of products. However, as long as SPL can be useful, there are many challenges regarding the use of that approach. One of the main problems which hinders the adoption of software product line (SPL) is the complexity regarding product management. In that context, we can remark the scoping problem. One of the existent ways to deal with scoping is the product portfolio scoping (PPS). PPS aims to define the products that should be developed as well as their key features. In general, that approach is driven by marketing aspects, like cost of the product and customer satisfaction. Defining a product portfolio by using the many different available aspects is a NP-hard problem. This work presents an improved hybrid approach to solve the feature model selection problem, aiming at supporting product portfolio scoping. The proposal is based in a hybrid approach not dependent on any particular algorithm/technology. We have evaluated the usefulness and scalability of our approach using one real SPL (ArgoUML-SPL) and synthetic SPLs. As per the evaluation results, our approach is both useful from a practitioner's perspective and scalable.},

However, few works seek to adjust the approach of software product line to applications in the context of semantic web. This is because applications in this context assume the use of semantic services and intelligent agents. As a result, it is necessary that there are assets that provide adequate interoperability both semantic services and intelligent agents. In this sense, it is proposed in this paper the use of ontologies for the specification of entire a project of a SPL. With this, it can be a sufficiently formal specification that can be interpreted by both software engineers and computational algorithms.},

This process is vital to the maintenance and evolution of software systems.Software product line engineering is a paradigm for the construction and customization of large-scale software systems. As systems grow in complexity and size, maintaining a clean structure becomes arguably more important. However, product line literature uses the term "refactoring" for such a wide range of reengineering activities that it has become difficult to see how these activities pertain to maintenance and evolution and how they are related.We improve this situation in the following way: i) We identify the dimensions along which product line reengineering occurs. ii) We derive a taxonomy that distinguishes and relates these reengineering activities. iii) We propose definitions for the three main branches of this taxonomy. iv) We classify a corpus of existing work.},

abstract = {Context: Variability management is a key activity in software product line engineering. This paper focuses on managing rationale information during the decision-making activities that arise during variability management. By decision-making we refer to systematic problem solving by considering and evaluating various alternatives. Rationale management is a branch of science that enables decision-making based on the argumentation of stakeholders while capturing the reasons and justifications behind these decisions. Objective: Decision-making should be supported to identify variability in domain engineering and to resolve variation points in application engineering. We capture the rationale behind variability management decisions. The captured rationale information is useful to evaluate future changes of variability models as well as to handle future instantiations of variation points. We claim that maintaining rationale will enhance the longevity of variability models. Furthermore, decisions should be performed using a formal communication between domain engineering and application engineering. Method: We initiate the novel area of issue-based variability management (IVM) by extending variability management with rationale management. The key contributions of this paper are: (i) an issue-based variability management methodology (IVMM), which combines questions, options and criteria (QOC) and a specific variability approach; (ii) a meta-model for IVMM and a process for variability management and (iii) a tool for the methodology, which was developed by extending an open source rationale management tool. Results: Rationale approaches (e.g. questions, options and criteria) guide distributed stakeholders when selecting choices for instantiating variation points. Similarly, rationale approaches also aid the elicitation of variability and the evaluation of changes. The rationale captured within the decision-making process can be reused to perform future decisions on variability. Conclusion: IVMM was evaluated comparatively based on an experimental survey, which provided evidence that IVMM is more effective than a variability modeling approach that does not use issues.},

abstract = {Safety and security are important properties of any software system, particularly in safety-critical domains, such as embedded, automotive, or cyber-physical systems. Moreover, particularly those domains also employ highly-configurable systems to customize variants, for example, to different customer requirements or regulations. Unfortunately, we are missing an overview understanding of what research has been conducted on the intersection of safety and security with configurable systems. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic mapping study based on an automated search, covering ten years (2011--2020) and 65 relevant (out of 367) publications. We classified each publication based on established security and safety concerns (e.g., CIA triad) as well as the connection to configurable systems (e.g., ensuring security of such a system). In the end, we found that considerably more research has been conducted on safety concerns, but both properties seem under-explored in the context of configurable systems. Moreover, existing research focuses on two directions: Ensuring safety and security properties in product-line engineering; and applying product-line techniques to ensure safety and security properties. Our mapping study provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art as well as open issues, helping practitioners identify existing solutions and researchers define directions for future research.},

Software Product Lines (SPLs) address this trend by describing a family of software products that share a common set of features. However, choosing the appropriate set of features that matches a user's individual interests is hampered due to the overwhelming amount of possible SPL configurations. Recommender systems can address this challenge by filtering the number of configurations and suggesting a suitable set of features for the user's requirements. In this paper, we propose a context-aware recommender system for predicting feature selections in an extended SPL configuration scenario, i.e. taking nonfunctional properties of features into consideration. We present an empirical evaluation based on a large real-world dataset of configurations derived from industrial experience in the Enterprise Resource Planning domain. Our results indicate significant improvements in the predictive accuracy of our context-aware recommendation approach over a state-of-the-art binary-based approach.},

publisher = {IEEE Press},
abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software systems developed for specific market segments or domains. Commonly, SPLs emerge from sets of existing variants when their individual maintenance becomes infeasible. However, current approaches for SPL migration do not support design models, are partially automated, or do not reflect constraints from SPL domains. To tackle these limitations, the goal of this doctoral research plan is to propose an automated approach to the SPL migration process at the design level. This approach consists of three phases: detection, analysis and transformation. It uses as input the class diagrams and lists of features for each system variant, and relies on search-based algorithms to create a product line architecture that best captures the variability present in the variants. Our expected contribution is to support the adoption of SPL practices in companies that face the scenario of migrating variants to SPLs.},

However, few works in the literature discuss the application of SPL techniques to architect industry cloud computing tools, resulting in a lack of support to cloud architects on how to apply such techniques. This work presents how software product line techniques can be applied for architecting cloud tools, and discusses the benefits, drawbacks, and some challenges of applying such techniques to develop a real industry cloud tool, named as Installation Service.},

abstract = {Adaptability and reusability are important quality attributes for software targeted for global market due to diverse market needs, ever increasing number of features, rapidly changing technologies, and various laws/standards of different countries. In response to these requirements, software development organizations are interested in product line engineering and searching for support tools. However, most of the existing tools for supporting product line engineering focus only on providing mechanisms for instantiating products without adequately supporting development of software assets that are adaptable and reusable.To address this problem, we provide a CASE tool, called VULCAN, that provides architecture models/patterns that are adaptable/reusable and also supports mechanisms for instantiating products from assets. We have applied VULCAN to various product lines including glucose management systems and elevator control systems, and we could experience that maintainability of the assets has improved substantially because a large portion of the assets are specifications rather than low-level code and product-specific code is generated from the specifications.},

abstract = {In software product lines (SPL), i.e., a family of similar software systems sharing common and variable artifacts, modeling evolution and reasoning about it is challenging, as not only a single system, but rather a set of system variants as well as their interdependencies change. An integrated modeling formalism for variability and evolution is required to allow the capturing of evolution operations that are applied to SPL artifacts, and to facilitate the impact analysis of evolution on the artifact level. Delta modeling is a flexible transformational variability modeling approach, where the variability and commonality between variants are explicitly documented and analyzable by means of transformations modeled as deltas. In this paper, we lift the notion of delta modeling to capture both, variability and evolution, by deltas. We evolve a delta model specifying a set of variants by applying higher-order deltas. A higher-order delta encapsulates evolution operations, i.e., additions, removals, or modifications of deltas, and transforms a delta model in its new version. In this way, we capture the complete evolution history of delta-oriented SPLs by higher-order delta models. By analyzing each higher-order delta application, we are further able to reason about the impact and, thus, the changes to the specified set of variants. We prototypically implement our formalism and show its applicability using a system from the automation engineering domain.},

Architectural styles help to improve the Product Line Architecture (PLA) design by providing a better organization of its elements, which results in some benefits, like flexibility, extensibility and maintainability. The PLA design can also be improved by using a search based optimization approach, taking into account different metrics, such as cohesion, coupling and feature modularization. However, the application of search operators changes the PLA organization, and consequently may violate the architectural styles rules, impacting negatively in the architecture understanding. To overcome such limitation, this work introduces a set of search operators to be used in the search based design with the goal of preserving the architectural styles during the optimization process. Such operators consider rules of the layered and client/server architectural styles, generally used in the search based design of conventional architectures and PLAs. The operators are implemented and evaluated in the context of MOA4PLA, a Multi-objective Optimization Approach for PLA Design. Results from an empirical evaluation show that the proposed operators contribute to obtain better solutions, preserving the adopted style and also improving some software metric values.},

abstract = {Context: ''Reuse'' and ''Model Based Development'' are two prominent trends for improving industrial development efficiency. Product lines are used to reduce the time to create product variants by reusing components. The model based approach provides the opportunity to enhance knowledge capture for a system in the early stages in order to be reused throughout its lifecycle. This paper describes how these two trends are combined to support development and support of a simulator product line for the SAAB 39 Gripen fighter aircraft. Objective: The work aims at improving the support (in terms of efficiency and quality) when creating simulation model configurations. Software based simulators are flexible so variants and versions of included models may easily be exchanged. The objective is to increase the reuse when combining models for usage in a range of development and training simulators. Method: The research has been conducted with an interactive approach using prototyping and demonstrations, and the evaluation is based on an iterative and a retrospective method. Results: A product line of simulator models for the SAAB 39 Gripen aircraft has been analyzed and defined in a Product Variant Master. A configurator system has been implemented for creation, integration, and customization of stringent simulator model configurations. The system is currently under incorporation in the standard development process at SAAB Aeronautics. Conclusion: The explicit and visual description of products and their variability through a configurator system enables better insights and a common understanding so that collaboration on possible product configurations improves and the potential of software reuse increases. The combination of application fields imposes constraints on how traditional tools and methods may be utilized. Solutions for Design Automation and Knowledge Based Engineering are available, but their application has limitations for Software Product Line engineering and the reuse of simulation models.},

On behalf of the government and based on promotional directives, KfW grants retail loans to small and medium enterprises, business founders, self-employed professionals, municipalities and private individuals. The promotional directives, called programs, define mandatory and optional properties of these loans. We have now successfully built a feature model from these properties.Our feature model will be presented with its outstanding characteristic, which is an additional subtree containing the programs as features. Complete and correct cross-tree constraints will also allow us to analyze and scope the portfolio, reduce complexity, and speed-up time-to-market. This is the advent of product line development at KfW.In order to standardize our portfolio, we have subsequently developed tools on top of the feature model, namely, a browser-based, multi-user configurator assisting non-technical-affine users in their product design, and a generator producing complete product documentation from the feature model and partial configurations. More applications are currently underway.This is our story of applying Software Product Line Engineering in banking, a domain where it is unusual or even unknown. We share our ideas, analyses, progress, and findings where the results have been thrilling us for the past two years and will continue to do so.},

abstract = {Product lines that use automated tools to configure shared assets (e.g., software or requirements or test cases or user documentation) based on product descriptions have long been known to bring about substantial development cost avoidance when compared to clone-and-own or product-specific development techniques. Now, however, it can be shown that the cost avoidance for configuring multiple shared assets is superlinear -- that is, the overall cost avoidance exceeds the sum of the that brought about by working with each of the shared assets in isolation. That is, a product line that configures (for example) requirements and code will avoid more cost than the sum of code-based plus requirements-based cost avoidance. In addition, we also observe a superlinear effect in terms of the number of products in the portfolio as well. This paper explores why these effects occur, and presents analytical and empirical evidence for their existence from one of the largest and most successful product lines in the literature, the AEGIS Weapon System. The result may lead to new insight into the economics of product line engineering in the systems engineering realm.},

The commonly large number of variants that can be derived from an SPL poses a unique set of challenges, because it is not feasible to test all the individual variants. Over the last few years many approaches for SPL testing have been devised. They usually select a set of variants to test based on some covering criterion. A problem when evaluating these testing approaches is properly comparing them to one another. Even though some benchmarks have been proposed, they focus on covering criteria and do not consider fault data in their analysis. Considering the dire lack of publicly available fault data, in this paper we present the first results of our ongoing project to introduce simulated faults into SPLs along with using evolutionary techniques for synthesizing unit test cases for SPL examples.},

If PLA documentation is missing, it can be recovered by reverse engineering the products. The recovered PLA is a relevant asset for developers and architects, that can be used to drive specific activities of SPL development and evolution, such as, understanding its structure and its variation points, and assessing reuse. This paper presents an exploratory study that investigated the effectiveness of recovered PLAs to address variability identification and support reuse assessment. We recovered the PLA of 15 open source SPL projects using the PLAR, a tool that supports PLA recovery and assessment based on information extracted from SPL products' source code. For each project, reuse assessment was supported by existing reuse metrics. The yielded results revealed that the number of products used in PLA recovery affected the variability identification, and the number of optional features affected the components reuse rate. These findings suggest that a minimum set of representative products should be identified and selected for PLA recovery, and the component reuse rate is a candidate metric for SPL reuse assessment.},

abstract = {To keep the software development for vehicles cost efficient, software components are reused for different variants as well as for succeeding generations. Furthermore, cost reductions are achieved by software sharing between the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the suppliers. However, as a consequence of the blackboxed view caused by software sharing, no common detailed software product line architecture specification for the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) software exists, as it would be required for analyzing the quality of the product line architecture, planning changes on the product line architecture, checking the compliance between the product architecture and the product line architecture, and therefore, avoiding architecture erosion. Thus, after several product generations, software erosion is growing steadily, resulting in an increasing effort of reusing software components, and planning of further development. Here, we propose an approach for repairing an eroded software consisting of a set of product architectures by applying strategies for recovery and discovery of the product line architecture. Furthermore, we give a methodology for a long-term manageable, plannable, and reuseable software product line architecture for automotive software systems.},

More specifically it is an experience report emphasizing the synergy17 resulting from combining MDE and SPL technologies. The software defined radio domain has very unique characteristics as its systems typically are a confluence of a number of typically challenging aspects of software development. To name a few, these systems are usually described by modifiers such as, embedded, real-time, distributed, object-oriented, portable, heterogeneous, multithreaded, high performance, dynamic, resource-constrained, safetycritical, secure, networked, component based and fault-tolerant. Each one of these modifiers by themselves carries with it a set of unique challenges but building systems characterized by all of these modifiers all at the same time makes for quite an adventure in software development. In addition to all of these, it is quite common in these embedded systems for components to have multiple implementations that must run on disparate processing elements. With all of this taken into account, it stands to reason that these systems could and should benefit greatly from advances in software technology such as product line engineering, domain-specific modeling and modeldriven engineering. It is our experience that one big boon to the software development industry is the combination of the Software Product Lines and Model Driven Engineering technologies.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering practices offer desirable characteristics such as rapid product development, reduced time-to-market, and more affordable development costs as a result of systematic representation of the variabilities of a domain of discourse that leads to methodical reuse of software assets. The development lifecycle of a product line consists of two main phases: domain engineering, which deals with the understanding and formally modeling of the target domain, and application engineering that is concerned with the configuration of a product line into one concrete product based on the preferences and requirements of the stakeholders. The work presented in this paper focuses on the application engineering phase and builds both the theoretical and technological tools to assist the stakeholders in (a) understanding the complex interactions of the features of a product line; (b) eliciting the utility of each feature for the stakeholders and hence exposing the stakeholders' otherwise implicit preferences in a way that they can more easily make decisions; and (c) dynamically building a decision model through interaction with the stakeholders and by considering the structural characteristics of software product line feature models, which will guide the stakeholders through the product configuration process. Initial exploratory empirical experiments that we have performed show that our proposed approach for helping stakeholders understand their feature preferences and its associated staged feature model configuration process is able to positively impact the quality of the end results of the application engineering process within the context of the limited number of participants. In addition, it has been observed that the offered tooling support is able to ease the staged feature model configuration process.},

Search-based approaches can provide automated discovery of near-optimal PLAs and make its design less dependent on human architects. To do this, it is necessary to adopt a suitable PLA representation to apply the search operators. In this sense, we review existing architecture representations proposed by related work, but all of them need to be extended to encompass specific characteristics of SPL. Then, the use of such representations for PLA is discussed and, based on the performed analysis, we introduce a novel direct PLA representation for search-based optimization. Some implementation aspects are discussed involving implementation details about the proposed PLA representation, constraints and impact on specific search operators. Ongoing work addresses the application of specific search operators for the proposed representation and the definition of a fitness function to be applied in a multi-objective search-based approach for the PLA design.},

abstract = {Reuse of software is a promising approach to improving the efficiency of software development regarding time, cost and quality. Reuse requires a systematic approach. The best results are achieved if we focus on systems in a specific domain, so-called product line. The key difference between the conventional software engineering and software product line engineering is variant management. The main idea of software product line is to identify the common core functionality which can be implemented once and reused afterwards for all members of the product line. To facilitate this reuse opportunity the domain engineering phase makes the domain model comprising the common as well as variant requirements. In principle, common requirements among systems in a family are easy to handle. However, problem arises during handling variants. Different variants have dependencies on each other; a single variant can affect several variants of the domain model. These problems become complex when the volume of information grows in a domain and there are a lot of variants with several interdependencies. Hence, a separate model is required for handling the variants. This paper presents a mechanism, which we call, Unified Tabular Method to facilitate the management of variant dependencies in product lines. The tabular method consists of a variant part to model the variants and their dependencies, and a decision table to depict the customization decision regarding each variant while deriving customized products. Tabular method alleviates the problem of possible explosion of variant combinations and facilitates the tracing of variant information in the domain model},

abstract = {Product line engineering is an emerging paradigm of developing a family of products. While product line analysis and design mainly focus on reasoning about commonality and variability of family members, product line implementation gives its attention to mechanisms of managing variability. In many cases, however, product line methods do not impose any specific synthesis mechanisms on product line implementation, so implementation details are left to developers. In our previous work, we adopted feature-oriented product line engineering to build a family of compilers and managed variations using the Standard ML module system. We demonstrated the applicability of this module system to product line implementation. Although we have benefited from the product line engineering paradigm, it mostly served us as a design paradigm to change the way we think about a set of closely related compilers, not to change the way we build them. The problem was that Standard ML did not fully realize this paradigm at the code level, which caused some difficulties when we were developing a set of compilers.In this paper, we address such issues with a language-based solution. MLPolyR is our choice of an implementation language. It supports three different programming styles. First, its first-class cases facilitate composable extensions at the expression levels. Second, its module language provides extensible and parameterized modules, which make large-scale extensible programming possible. Third, its macro system simplifies specification and composition of feature related code. We will show how the combination of these language features work together to facilitate the product line engineering paradigm.},

abstract = {Software Product Line SPL provides the facility to systematically reuse of software improving the efficiency of software development regarding time, cost and quality. The main idea of SPL is to identify the common core functionality that can be implemented once and reused afterwards. A variant model has also to be developed to manage the variants of the SPL. Usually, a domain model consisting of the common and variant requirements is developed during domain engineering phase to alleviate the reuse opportunity. The authors present a product line model comprising of a variant part for the management of variant and a decision table to depict the customization of decision regarding each variant. Feature diagrams are widely used to model SPL variants. Both feature diagram and our variant model, which is based on tabular method, lacks logically sound formal representation and hence, not amenable to formal verification. Formal representation and verification of SPL has gained much interest in recent years. This chapter presents a logical representation of the variant model by using first order logic. With this representation, the table based variant model as well as the graphical feature diagram can now be verified logically. Besides applying first-order-logic to model the features, the authors also present an approach to model and analyze SPL model by using semantic web approach using OWL-DL. The OWL-DL representation also facilitates the search and maintenance of feature models and support knowledge sharing within a reusable engineering context. Reasoning tools are used to verify the consistency of the feature configuration for both logic-based and semantic web-based approaches.},

abstract = {Variability is present in most modern object-oriented softwareintensive systems, despite that they commonly do not follow a product line approach. In these systems, variability is implicit and hardly documented as it is implemented by different traditional mechanisms, namely inheritance, overloading, or design patterns. This hampers variability management as automatic identification of variation points (vp-s) with variants is very difficult. symfinder is a symmetry-based tooled approach that enables automatic identification of potential vp-s with variants in such systems. Then, it visualizes them relying on their density in code assets. From the Java-only version presented at SPLC'2019, we present here several notable improvements. They concern an added support for C++ systems, the identification of vp-s implemented by Decorator and Template pattern instances, an enhanced visualization (e.g., to display all variants, and package coloring), as well as automation of the mapping of potential vp-s to domain features.},

abstract = {Context: Numerous approaches are available for modeling product lines and their variability. However, the long-term impacts of model-based development on maintenance effort and model complexity can hardly be investigated due to a lack of empirical data. Conducting empirical research in product line engineering is difficult as companies are typically reluctant to provide access to data from their product lines. Also, many benefits of product lines can be measured only in longitudinal studies, which are difficult to perform in most environments. Objective: In this paper, we thus aim to explore the benefit of simulation to investigate the evolution of model-based product lines. Method: We present a simulation approach for exploring the effects of product line evolution on model complexity and maintenance effort. Our simulation considers characteristics of product lines (e.g., size, dependencies in models) and we experiment with different evolution profiles (e.g., technical refactoring vs. placement of new products). Results: We apply the approach in a simulation experiment that uses data from real-world product lines from the domain of industrial automation systems to demonstrate its feasibility. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that simulation contributes to understanding the effects of maintenance and evolution in model-based product lines.},

abstract = {Software product line SPL engineering involves the modeling, analysis, and configuration of variability-rich systems. We improve the performance of the multi-objective optimization of SPLs in Alloy by several orders of magnitude with two techniques.First, we rewrite the model to remove binary relations that map to integers, which enables removing most of the integer atoms from the universe. SPL models often require using large bitwidths, hence the number of integer atoms in the universe can be orders of magnitude more than the other atoms. In our approach, the tuples for these integer-valued relations are computed outside the sat solver before returning the solution to the user. Second, we add a checkpointing facility to Kodkod, which allows the multi-objective optimization algorithm to reuse previously computed internal sat solver state, after backtracking.Together these result in orders of magnitude improvement in using Alloy as a multi-objective optimization tool for software product lines.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) is a technology aimed at speeding up the development process. Although SPLs are widely used, their maintenance is a challenging task. In particular, when maintaining a SPL feature, developers need to know which parts of other dependent features might be affected by this maintenance. Otherwise, further maintenance problems can be introduced in the SPL implementation. However, the identification and understanding of the so-called feature dependencies in the source code are an exhaustive and error-prone task. In fact, developers often ignore unconsciously feature dependencies while reasoning about SPL maintenance. To overcome this problem, this PhD research aims at understanding the properties of feature dependencies in the source code that exert impact on SPL maintenance. Furthermore, we propose a way to structure and segregate feature interfaces in order to help developers to identify and understand feature dependencies, thus reducing the effort and avoiding undesirable side effects in SPL maintenance.},

abstract = {The goals of cross-product reuse in a software product line (SPL) are to mitigate production costs and improve the quality. In addition to reuse across products, due to the evolutionary development process, a SPL also exhibits reuse across releases. In this paper, we empirically explore how the two types of reuse--reuse across products and reuse across releases--affect the quality of a SPL and our ability to accurately predict fault proneness. We measure the quality in terms of post-release faults and consider different levels of reuse across products (i.e., common, high-reuse variation, low-reuse variation, and single-use packages), over multiple releases. Assessment results showed that quality improved for common, low-reuse variation, and single-use packages as they evolved across releases. Surprisingly, within each release, among preexisting (`old') packages, the cross-product reuse did not affect the change and fault proneness. Cross-product predictions based on pre-release data accurately ranked the packages according to their post-release faults and predicted the 20 % most faulty packages. The predictions benefited from data available for other products in the product line, with models producing better results (1) when making predictions on smaller products (consisting mostly of common packages) rather than on larger products and (2) when trained on larger products rather than on smaller products.},

In order to cope with the evolution of the variability, the VITAL approach and tool have been developed and used in different industrial settings to analyze variability realizations relying on the C preprocessor. Over the last decade, further promising analysis approaches and tools have been developed. To understand, if and how they could enhance the VITAL approach, we have conducted an analysis of promising technologies.In this paper, we share some of our findings along our comparative study on variability code analysis technologies. As we have conducted the study in the light of the intended VITAL enhancement, the study does not claim completeness. Nevertheless, we believe that the findings can help researchers and industrial practitioners to gain an overview and find entry points for their own investigations.},

abstract = {Unlike embedded systems, some of enterprise systems are evolved over the decades. The predictability of requirements is a key to success in building reusable assets however it is very hard to predict future business context changes, which are driving factors of requirements. Thus, both functional and context variability must be managed in order to satisfy ever-changing requirements. Scalability does matter for enterprise systems in two aspects. One aspect comes from data volume. Once data become big, it is difficult to maintain performance requirements without de-normalizing database schema. Since database de-normalization is driven by non-functional properties, a model driven approach is not feasible if the model cannot express such properties. Another aspect comes from the unpredictability of future functional requirements. A functional decomposition of enterprise systems usually introduces ever-increasing complexity among systems' interactions due to cross-cutting requirements across functional systems. This paper reflects our empirical studies in data intensive large enterprise systems such as retail and telecommunication industries with industry independent application framework to separate functional and non-functional concerns. Our variability management technique is based on database schema modeling, which can be evolved incrementally in scaling an enterprise system with both data and functional aspects.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) engineering implements self-adaptive systems by dynamically binding or unbinding features at runtime according to a feature model. However, these features may interact in unexpected and undesired ways leading to critical consequences for the DSPL. Moreover, (re)configurations may negatively affect the runtime system's architectural qualities, manifesting architectural bad smells. These issues are challenging to detect due to the combinatorial explosion of the number of interactions amongst features. As some of them may appear at runtime, we need a runtime approach to their analysis and mitigation. This thesis introduces the Behavioral Map (BM) formalism that captures information from different sources (feature model, code) to automatically detect these issues. We provide behavioral map inference algorithms. Using the Smart Home Environment (SHE) as a case study, we describe how a BM is helpful to identify critical feature interactions and architectural smells. Our preliminary results already show promising progress for both feature interactions and architectural bad smells identification at runtime.},

More specifically it is an experience report emphasizing the synergy 17 resulting from combining MDE and SPL technologies. The software defined radio domain has very unique characteristics as its systems typically are a confluence of a number of typically challenging aspects of software development. To name a few, these systems are usually described by modifiers such as, embedded, real-time, distributed, object-oriented, portable, heterogeneous, multithreaded, high performance, dynamic, resource-constrained, safety-critical, secure, networked, component based and fault-tolerant. Each one of these modifiers by themselves carries with it a set of unique challenges, but building systems characterized by all of these modifiers all at the same time makes for a daunting task in software development. In addition to all of these, it is quite common in these embedded systems for components to have multiple implementations that must run on disparate processing elements. With all of this taken into account, it stands to reason that these systems could and should benefit greatly from advances in software technology such as product line engineering, domain-specific modeling and model-driven engineering. It is our experience that one big benefit to the software development industry is the combination of the Software Product Lines and Model Driven Engineering technologies.},

For instance, unexpected behavior of SoS is often caused by the complex interactions between the involved systems and their environment at runtime. Monitoring infrastructures (MIs) provide support for engineers and support staff analyzing the behavior of SoS during development and operation. Variability plays an important role in MIs, however, while some approaches exist, managing variability of MIs remains challenging. In this paper, we describe how we applied a variability management approach to support the reconfiguration of a SoS monitoring infrastructure (MI) at runtime. Our approach provides configuration support for setting up the MI to reflect system variability. It also supports runtime reconfiguration of the MI to reflect the different monitoring tasks of users and to support evolution. We motivate our work using the case of monitoring a real-world SoS from the domain of industrial automation and discuss variability-related challenges in four monitoring scenarios. We evaluate the feasibility of our approach by applying it to these scenarios. We also demonstrate that our approach reduces manual reconfiguration effort and helps to reduce the overhead of the MI.},

This is even more crucial in case of software product line, because it deals with the development of a line of products sharing common architecture and having controlled variability. The main contributions of this paper is to increase the understanding of the influence of key software product line architecture process activities on the overall performance of software product line by conducting a comprehensive empirical investigation covering a broad range of organizations currently involved in the business of software product lines. This is the first study to empirically investigate and demonstrate the relationships between some of the software product line architecture process activities and the overall software product line performance of an organization at the best of our knowledge. The results of this investigation provide empirical evidence that software product line architecture process activities play a significant role in successfully developing and managing a software product line.},

abstract = {Meshing tools are highly complex software for generating and managing geometrical discretizations. Due to their complexity, they have generally been developed by end users - physicists, forest engineers, mechanical engineers - with ad hoc methodologies and not by applying well established software engineering practices. Different meshing tools have been developed over the years, making them a good application domain for Software Product Lines (SPLs). This paper proposes building a domain model that captures the different domain characteristics such as features, goals, scenarios and a lexicon, and the relationships among them. The model is partly specified using a formal language. The domain model captures product commonalities and variabilities as well as the particular characteristics of different SPL products. The paper presents a rigorous process for building the domain model, where specific roles, activities and artifacts are identified. This process also clearly establishes consistency and completeness conditions. The usefulness of the model and the process are validated by using them to generate a software product line of Tree Stem Deformation (TSD) meshing tools. We also present Meshing Tool Generator, a software that follows the SPL approach for generating meshing tools belonging to the TSD SPL. We show how an end user can easily generate three different TSD meshing tools using Meshing Tool Generator.},

abstract = {Software product lines (SPLs) are used in industry to develop families of similar software systems. Legacy systems, either highly configurable or with a story of versions and local variations, are potential candidates for reconfiguration as SPLs using reengineering techniques. Existing SPLs can also be restructured using specific refactorings to improve their internal quality. Although many contributions (including industrial experiences) can be found in the literature, we lack a global vision covering the whole life cycle of an evolving product line. This study aims to survey existing research on the reengineering of legacy systems into SPLs and the refactoring of existing SPLs in order to identify proven approaches and pending challenges for future research in both subfields. We launched a systematic mapping study to find as much literature as possible, covering the diverse terms involved in the search string (restructuring, refactoring, reengineering, etc. always connected with SPLs) and filtering the papers using relevance criteria. The 74 papers selected were classified with respect to several dimensions: main focus, research and contribution type, academic or industrial validation if included, etc. We classified the research approaches and analyzed their feasibility for use in industry. The results of the study indicate that the initial works focused on the adaptation of generic reengineering processes to SPL extraction. Starting from that foundation, several trends have been detected in recent research: the integrated or guided reengineering of (typically object-oriented) legacy code and requirements; specific aspect-oriented or feature-oriented refactoring into SPLs, and more recently, refactoring for the evolution of existing product lines. A majority of papers include academic or industrial case studies, though only a few are based on quantitative data. The degree of maturity of both subfields is different: Industry examples for the reengineering of the legacy system subfield are abundant, although more evaluation research is needed to provide better evidence for adoption in industry. Product line evolution through refactoring is an emerging topic with some pending challenges. Although it has recently received some attention, the theoretical foundation is rather limited in this subfield and should be addressed in the near future. To sum up, the main contributions of this work are the classification of research approaches as well as the analysis of remaining challenges, open issues, and research opportunities.},

abstract = {Software product lines (SPL) aim at reducing time-to-market and increasing software quality through extensive, planned reuse of artifacts. An essential activity in SPL is variability management, i.e., defining and managing commonality and variability among member products. Due to the large scale and complexity of today's software-intensive systems, variability management has become increasingly complex to conduct. Accordingly, tool support for variability management has been gathering increasing momentum over the last few years and can be considered a key success factor for developing and maintaining SPLs. While several studies have already been conducted on variability management, none of these analyzed the available tool support in detail. In this work, we report on a survey in which we analyzed 37 existing variability management tools identified using a systematic literature review to understand the tools’ characteristics, maturity, and the challenges in the field. We conclude that while most studies on variability management tools provide a good motivation and description of the research context and challenges, they often lack empirical data to support their claims and findings. It was also found that quality attributes important for the practical use of tools such as usability, integration, scalability, and performance were out of scope for most studies.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is nowadays one of the most promising IT technologies, since it provides seemingly unlimited resources on demand at low costs. Hence, different types of applications have been migrated to IaaS environments, e.g. multi-tier (distributed) applications. However, in order to benefit from such characteristics, cloud configurations (i.e. virtual resource configurations) should be designed accordingly to the necessities of the applications. Furthermore, such configurations have to provide the required resources not only at the application deployment-time, but also during the whole application execution time. Hence, adaptive paradigms are required when designing solutions to cloud applications with dynamic resource requirements. Software Product Lines (SPLs) provide great flexibility and a high level of abstraction to describe complete system configurations. Even though SPLs are not commonly used to describe changes after an initial product (configuration) has been created, their inherent characteristics can enable producing the required virtual resource configuration to adapt applications after their initial deployment, i.e., at runtime. In this paper, we present an approach to create and adapt cloud configurations at the IaaS level by using SPLs. We focus on the architectural design of our solution as well as on the possible implementation challenges we could face.},

abstract = {Context: In the long run, features of a software product line (SPL) evolve with respect to changes in stakeholder requirements and system contexts. Neither domain engineering nor requirements engineering handles such co-evolution of requirements and contexts explicitly, making it especially hard to reason about the impact of co-changes in complex scenarios. Objective: In this paper, we propose a problem-oriented and value-based analysis method for variability evolution analysis. The method takes into account both kinds of changes (requirements and contexts) during the life of an evolving software product line. Method: The proposed method extends the core requirements engineering ontology with the notions to represent variability-intensive problem decomposition and evolution. On the basis of problemorientation, the analysis method identifies candidate changes, detects influenced features, and evaluates their contributions to the value of the SPL. Results and Conclusion: The process of applying the analysis method is illustrated using a concrete case study of an evolving enterprise software system, which has confirmed that tracing back to requirements and contextual changes is an effective way to understand the evolution of variability in the software product line.},

abstract = {A feature model represents a set of variants as configurable features and dependencies between them. During variant configuration, (de)selection of a feature may entail that other features must or cannot be selected. A Modal Implication Graph (MIG) enables efficient decision propagation to perform automatic (de)selection of subsequent features. In addition, it facilitates other configuration-related activities such as t-wise sampling. Evolution of a feature model may change its configuration logic, thereby invalidating an existing MIG and forcing a full recomputation. However, repeated recomputation of a MIG is expensive, and thus hampers the overall usefulness of MIGs for frequently evolving feature models. In this paper, we devise a method to incrementally compute updated MIGs after feature model evolution. We identify expensive steps in the MIG construction algorithm, enable them for incremental computation, and measure performance compared to a full rebuild of a complete MIG within the evolution histories of four real-world feature models. Results show that our incremental method can increase the speed of MIG construction by orders of magnitude, depending on the given scenario and extent of evolutionary changes.},

abstract = {Modularity benefits, including the independent maintenance and comprehension of individual modules, have been widely advocated. However, empirical assessments to investigate those benefits have mostly focused on source code, and thus, the relevance of modularity to earlier artifacts is still not so clear (such as requirements and design models). In this paper, we use a multimethod technique, including designed experiments, to empirically evaluate the benefits of modularity in the context of two approaches for specifying product line use case scenarios: PLUSS and MSVCM. The first uses an annotative approach for specifying variability, whereas the second relies on aspect-oriented constructs for separating common and variant scenario specifications. After evaluating these approaches through the specifications of several systems, we find out that MSVCM reduces feature scattering and improves scenario cohesion. These results suggest that evolving a product line specification using MSVCM requires only localized changes. On the other hand, the results of six experiments reveal that MSVCM requires more time to derive the product line specifications and, contrasting with the modularity results, reduces the time to evolve a product line specification only when the subjects have been well trained and are used to the task of evolving product line specifications.},

Our PLiC approach resembles the fact that, in practice, the domain of a large product line is divided into sub-domains. A PLiC (product line component) packages all results (configuration, generation, and implementation assets) of a sub-domain and offers interfaces for configuration and generation. With our approach we tackle the challenges of using multiple and different types of configuration models and text files, give support for automated product generation, and integrate feature modeling to support application engineering as an extensive development task.},

Unfortunately, options and their mutual interactions create a huge configuration space which is intractable to exhaustively explore. Instead of testing all products, machine learning is increasingly employed to approximate the set of acceptable products out of a small training sample of configurations. Machine learning (ML) techniques can refine a software product line through learned constraints and a priori prevent non-acceptable products to be derived. In this paper, we use adversarial ML techniques to generate adversarial configurations fooling ML classifiers and pinpoint incorrect classifications of products (videos) derived from an industrial video generator. Our attacks yield (up to) a 100% misclassification rate and a drop in accuracy of 5%. We discuss the implications these results have on SPL quality assurance.},

Specifically, to make an architecture design, presented practices include: understanding relevant domains, requirements engineering, architecture definition. The strengths and weaknesses of Face book architecture are evaluated with the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM). As a result of applying a framework for SPL practice, layered view and component-based view are illustrated along with variabilities represented by Product Line UML-based Software Engineering (PLUS) and Orthogonal Variability Model (OVM). Based on the analysis of requirements of SNS, additional services such as file sharing and instant messaging are represented as optional components. In case of Face book, three key quality attributes, i.e., availability, scalability, and privacy are analyzed by using quality attribute utility tree. We identified that Face book employs client-server architecture. Through ATAM, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approach promoting privacy is explained.},

COPLIMO is an economic model that relies on COCOMO II to estimate the benefits of adopting a product line approach compared to developing the products one by one. Although COPLIMO is an ideal economic model to support decision making on the incremental development of a product line, it makes some simplifying assumptions that may produce high distortions in the estimates (e.g., COPLIMO takes for granted that all the products have the same size). This paper proposes a COPLIMO reformulation that avoids such assumptions and, consequently, improves the accuracy of the estimates. To support our proposal, we present an algorithm that infers the additional information that our COPLIMO reformulation requires from feature diagrams, which is a widespread notation to model the domain of a product line.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is a paradigm that advocates the reusability of software engineering assets and the rapid development of new applications for a target domain. These objectives are achieved by capturing the commonalities and variabilities between the applications of the target domain and through the development of comprehensive and variability-covering feature models. The feature models developed within the software product line development process need to cover the relevant features and aspects of the target domain. In other words, the feature models should be elaborate representations of the feature space of that domain. Given that feature models, i.e., software product line feature models, are developed mostly by domain analysts by sifting through domain documentation, corporate records and transcribed interviews, the process is a cumbersome and error-prone one. In this paper, we propose a decision support platform that assists domain analysts throughout the domain engineering lifecycle by: (1) automatically performing natural language processing tasks over domain documents and identifying important information for the domain analysts such as the features and integrity constraints that exist in the domain documents; (2) providing a collaboration platform around the domain documents such that multiple domain analysts can collaborate with each other during the process using a Wiki; (3) formulating semantic links between domain terminology with external widely used ontologies such as WordNet in order to disambiguate the terms used in domain documents; and (4) developing traceability links between the unstructured information available in the domain documents and their formal counterparts within the formal feature model representations. Results obtained from our controlled experimentations show that the decision support platform is effective in increasing the performance of the domain analysts during the domain engineering lifecycle in terms of both the coverage and accuracy measures.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPL) are generally specified using a Feature Model (FM), an artifact designed in the early stages of the SPL development life cycle. This artifact can quickly become too complex, which makes it challenging to maintain an SPL. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the artifact's maintainability continuously. The literature brings some approaches that evaluate FM maintainability through the aggregation of maintainability measures. Machine Learning (ML) models can be used to create these approaches. They can aggregate the values of independent variables into a single target data, also called a dependent variable. Besides, when using white-box ML models, it is possible to interpret and explain the ML model results. This work proposes white-box ML models intending to classify the FM maintainability based on 15 measures. To build the models, we performed the following steps: (i) we compared two approaches to evaluate the FM maintainability through a human-based oracle of FM maintainability classifications; (ii) we used the best approach to pre-classify the ML training dataset; (iii) we generated three ML models and compared them against classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC-ROC; and, (iv) we used the best model to create a mechanism capable of providing improvement indicators to domain engineers. The best model used the decision tree algorithm that obtained accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.81, F1-Score of 0.79, and AUC-ROC of 0.91. Using this model, we could reduce the number of measures needed to evaluate the FM maintainability from 15 to 9 measures.},

abstract = {Android is an open platform, developed by Google and Open Mobile Handset Alliance targeting mobile devices. Its constant evolution and increasing cost reduction made them suitable for complex applications especially for data collection applications. Data collection is a domain which evolved to use mobile devices to collect information, targeting different fields of study including: physical and social sciences, humanities, business, demographic surveys, agriculture, biology, and geology. Android usually runs on different hardware and software domains with similar functional and non-functional features. The data collection domain has a lot of sub-domains, creating an opportunity to explore software variability and quality properties such as reliability, availability, and data integrity using Component-Based Development (CBD), Fault Tolerance Techniques and Software Product Line (SPL) with Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD). However, the use of mobile application for data collection poses some challenges like severe hardware restrictions (such as limited power processing and short battery lifetime) and the use of sophisticated techniques can negatively impact in application performance, and quality properties. In this work, these issues were addressed by proposing the development of a robust SPL architecture called Robust SPL for Data Collection (R-SPL-DC) and a real application called E-Phenology Collector for data collection domain to assess the use fault tolerance techniques, CBD, SPL, and AOSD to ensure availability, reliability, and data integrity without significant impacts on the overall performance of the mobile device. The results have shown that the use of R-SPL-DC is promising and suits the requirements for data collection domain.},

Some quality attributes can be modelled using software components, and are normally known as Functional Quality Attributes (FQAs). Applications may require different FQAs, and each FQA (e.g., security) can be composed of many concerns (e.g., access control or authentication). They normally have dependencies between them and crosscut the system architecture. The goal of the work presented here is to provide the means for software architects to focus only on application functionality, without having to worry about FQAs. The idea is to model FQAs separately from application functionality following a Software Product Line (SPL) approach. By combining SPL and aspect-oriented mechanisms, we will define a generic process to model and automatically inject FQAs into the application without breaking the base architecture. We will provide and compare two implementations of our generic approach using different variability and architecture description languages: (i) feature models and an aspect-oriented architecture description language; and (ii) the Common Variability Language (CVL) and a MOF-compliant language (e.g., UML). We also discuss the benefits and limitations of our approach. Modelling FQAs separately from the base application has many advantages (e.g., reusability, less coupled components, high cohesive architectures).},

However, migrating existing, customised product copies to a product line is still an open issue due to the required comprehension of differences among products and SPL design decisions. Most existing SPL approaches are focused on forward engineering. Only few aim to handle SPL evolution, but even those lack support of variability reverse engineering, which is necessary for migrating product copies to a product line. In this paper, we present how component architecture information can be used to enhance a variabilty reverse engineering process to target this challenge and show the relevance of component architecture in the individual requirements on the resulting SPL. We further provide an illustrating example to show how the concept is applied.},

abstract = {A software product line is a unified representation of a set of conceptually similar software systems that share many common features and satisfy the requirements of a particular domain. Within the context of software product lines, feature models are tree-like structures that are widely used for modeling and representing the inherent commonality and variability of software product lines. Given the fact that many different software systems can be spawned from a single software product line, it can be anticipated that a low-quality design can ripple through to many spawned software systems. Therefore, the need for early indicators of external quality attributes is recognized in order to avoid the implications of defective and low-quality design during the late stages of production. In this paper, we propose a set of structural metrics for software product line feature models and theoretically validate them using valid measurement-theoretic principles. Further, we investigate through controlled experimentation whether these structural metrics can be good predictors (early indicators) of the three main subcharacteristics of maintainability: analyzability, changeability, and understandability. More specifically, a four-step analysis is conducted: (1) investigating whether feature model structural metrics are correlated with feature model maintainability through the employment of classical statistical correlation techniques; (2) understanding how well each of the structural metrics can serve as discriminatory references for maintainability; (3) identifying the sufficient set of structural metrics for evaluating each of the subcharacteristics of maintainability; and (4) evaluating how well different prediction models based on the proposed structural metrics can perform in indicating the maintainability of a feature model. Results obtained from the controlled experiment support the idea that useful prediction models can be built for the purpose of evaluating feature model maintainability using early structural metrics. Some of the structural metrics show significant correlation with the subjective perception of the subjects about the maintainability of the feature models.},

abstract = {Diversity is prevalent in modern software systems. Several system variants exist at the same time in order to adapt to changing user requirements. Additionally, software systems evolve over time in order to adjust to unanticipated changes in their application environment. In modern software development, software architecture modeling is an important means to deal with system complexity by architectural decomposition. This leads to the need of architectural description languages that can represent spatial and temporal variability. In this paper, we present delta modeling of software architectures as a uniform modeling formalism for architectural variability in space and in time. In order to avoid degeneration of the product line model under system evolution, we present refactoring techniques to maintain and improve the quality of the variability model. Using a running example from the automotive domain, we evaluate our approach by carrying out a case study that compares delta modeling with annotative variability modeling.},

Nonfunctional requirement analysis for the paradigm is a challenge problem, mainly due to the massive products that are involved. Especially in the situation where some products' nonfunctional requirements are not met, how do architects keep the revision, and the impact caused by the revision both minimal? This paper investigates the issue of nonfunctional requirement tradeoff analysis for software product lines at the architecture design stage, and proposes an architectural approach to assist architects in making optimal revision decisions based on nonfunctional tradeoff analysis results. In particular, the nonfunctional requirement supported in the approach at this stage is performance. The little's law has been adopted to support performance analysis for software product line architecture design. A Unified Modeling Language profile is also developed to support performance modeling for software product line architecture design, thus to facilitate architectural performance analysis.},

abstract = {Over the last two decades, software product lines have been used successfully in industry for building families of systems of related products, maximizing reuse, and exploiting their variable and configurable options. In a changing world, modern software demands more and more adaptive features, many of them performed dynamically, and the requirements on the software architecture to support adaptation capabilities of systems are increasing in importance. Today, many embedded system families and application domains such as ecosystems, service-based applications, and self-adaptive systems demand runtime capabilities for flexible adaptation, reconfiguration, and post-deployment activities. However, as traditional software product line architectures fail to provide mechanisms for runtime adaptation and behavior of products, there is a shift toward designing more dynamic software architectures and building more adaptable software able to handle autonomous decision-making, according to varying conditions. Recent development approaches such as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) attempt to face the challenges of the dynamic conditions of such systems but the state of these solution architectures is still immature. In order to provide a more comprehensive treatment of DSPL models and their solution architectures, in this research work we provide an overview of the state of the art and current techniques that, partially, attempt to face the many challenges of runtime variability mechanisms in the context of Dynamic Software Product Lines. We also provide an integrated view of the challenges and solutions that are necessary to support runtime variability mechanisms in DSPL models and software architectures.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) usually involves a shared set of core assets and a series of application products. To ensure consistency, the evolution of the core assets and all the application products should be coordinated and synchronized under a unified evolution process. Therefore, SPL evolution often involves cross-product propagation and synchronization besides application derivation based on core assets, presenting quite different characteristic from the evolution of individual software products. As software architectures, including the product line architecture (PLA) and application architectures, play a central role in SPL engineering and evolution, architecture-based evolution analysis is a natural way for analyzing and managing SPL evolution. In this paper, we explore common practices of architecture evolution and the rationale behind in industrial SPL development. To this end, we conduct a case study with Wingsoft examination system product line (WES-PL), an industrial product line with an evolution history of eight years and more than 10 application products. In the case study, we reviewed the evolution history of WES-PL architecture and analyzed several typical evolution cases. Based on the historical analysis, we identify some special problems in industrial SPL practice from the aspect of architecture evolution and summarize some useful experiences about SPL evolution decisions to complement classical SPL methodology. On the other hand, we also propose some possible improvements for the evolution management in WES-PL.},

However, PLA design is a people-intensive and non-trivial task, and to find the best architecture can be formulated as an optimization problem with many objectives. We found several approaches that address search-based design of software architectures by using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. However, such approaches have not been applied to PLAs. Considering such fact, in this work, we explore the use of these approaches to optimize PLAs. An extension of existing approaches is investigated, which uses specific metrics to evaluate the PLA characteristics. Then, we performed a case study involving one SPL. From the experience acquired during this study, we can relate some lessons learned, which are discussed in this work. Furthermore, the results point out that, in the case of PLAs, it is necessary to use SPL specific measures and evolutionary operators more sensitive to the SPL context.},

The models are realized using a set of customized tools for model based systems engineering and variability management, based on SysML models. The purpose is to present an industrial context that requires the adoption of a product line approach and of variability modeling techniques, outside of a pure-software domain. At Renault, the interest is in identifying variations and reuse opportunities early in the product development cycle, as well as in preparing vehicle configuration specifications during the systems engineering process. This would lead to lowering the engineering effort and to higher quality and confidence in carry-over and carry across based solutions. We advocate for a tight integration of variability management with the model based systems engineering approach, which needs to address methodological support, modeling techniques and efficient tools for interactive configuration, adapted for engineering activities.},

abstract = {In software product line engineering, the customers mostly concentrate on the functionalities of the target product during product configuration. The quality attributes of a target product, such as security and performance, are often assessed until the final product is generated. However, it might be very costly to fix the problem if it is found that the generated product cannot satisfy the customers' quality requirements. Although the quality of a generated product will be affected by all the life cycles of product development, feature-based product configuration is the first stage where the estimation or prediction of the quality attributes should be considered. As we know, the key issue of predicting the quality attributes for a product configured from feature models is to measure the interdependencies between functional features and quality attributes. The current existing approaches have several limitations on this issue, such as requiring real products for the measurement or involving domain experts' efforts. To overcome these limitations, we propose a systematic approach of modeling quality attributes in feature models based on domain experts' judgments using the analytic hierarchical process (AHP) and conducting quality aware product configuration based on the captured quality knowledge. Domain experts' judgments are adapted to avoid generating the real products for quality evaluation, and AHP is used to reduce domain experts' efforts involved in the judgments. A prototype tool is developed to implement the concepts of the proposed approach, and a formal evaluation is carried out based on a large-scale case study.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) seek to achieve gains in productivity and time to market. Many companies in several domains are constantly adopting SPLs. Dealing with SPLs begin after companies find themselves with successful variants of a product in a particular domain. The adoption of an SPL-based approach in the automotive industry may provide a significant return on investment. To switch to an SPL-based approach, practitioners lack a reengineering approach that supports SPL migration and evolution in a systematic fashion.This paper presents a practical evolution-based approach to migrate and evolve a set of variants of a given product into an SPL and describes a case study from the automotive domain. The case study considers the need to handle the classical sensor variants family (CSVF) at Bosch Company.Using this study, we performed a contributed step toward future switch of the CSVF into the SPL. We investigated the applicability of the proposed evolution-based approach with a real variants family (using the textual requirements of the CSVF) and we evaluated our approach using several data collection methods. The results reveal that our approach can be suitable for the automotive domain in the case study.},

abstract = {Product lines are often employed for the facilitation of software re-use, rapid application development and increase in productivity. Despite the numerous advantages of software product lines, the task of testing them is a cumbersome process due to the fact that the number of applications that need to be tested is exponential to the number of features represented in the product line. In this paper, we attempt to reduce the number of required tests for testing a software product line while at the same time preserving an acceptable fault coverage. For this purpose, we introduce eight coverage criteria based on the transformation of software product line feature models into formal context-free grammars. The theoretical foundation for the proposed coverage criteria is based on the development of equivalence partitions on the software product line configuration space and the use of boundary value analysis for test suite generation. We have performed experiments on several SPLOT feature models, the results of which show that the test suite generation strategies based on the proposed coverage criteria are effective in significantly reducing the number of required tests and at the same time maintaining a high fault coverage ratio.},

The goal of the analysis is to understand, review, and recommend strategies for improving the CFS' existing unit testing infrastructure as well as to capture lessons learned and best practices that can be used by other software product line (SPL) teams for their unit testing. The results of the analysis show that the core and application modules of the CFS are unit tested in isolation using a stub framework developed by the CFS team. The application developers can unit test their code without waiting for the core modules to be completed, and vice versa. The analysis found that this unit testing approach incorporates many practical and useful solutions such as allowing for unit testing without requiring hardware and special OS features in-the-loop by defining stub implementations of dependent modules. These solutions are worth considering when deciding how to design the testing architecture for a SPL.},

abstract = {We present a set of change patterns for managing process families.The patters are derived from existing process variability-specific constructs.The patterns aim to reduce the effort for modeling and evolving a process family.They are validated through a case study to show the feasibility of their application. Context: The increasing adoption of process-aware information systems together with the high variability in business processes has resulted in collections of process families. These families correspond to a business process model and its variants, which can comprise hundreds or thousands of different ways of realizing this process. Managing process variability in this context can be very challenging, labor-intensive, and error-prone, and new approaches for managing process families are necessary.Objective: We aim to facilitate variability management in process families, ensure process family correctness, and reduce the effort needed for such purposes.Method: We have derived a set of change patterns for process families from variability-specific language constructs identified in the literature. For validation, we have conducted a case study with a safety standard in which we have measured the number of operations needed to model and evolve the variability of the standard with and without the patterns.Results: We present 10 change patterns for managing variability in process families and show how they can be implemented. The patterns support the modeling and evolution of process families and ensure process family correctness by automatically introducing and deleting modeling elements. The case study results show that the application of the defined change patterns can reduce the number of operations when modeling a process family by 34% and when evolving it by 40%.Conclusions: The application of the change patterns can help in effectively modeling and evolving large and highly-variable process families. Their application can also considerably reduce variability management effort.},

abstract = {The recent trend of switching from single software product development to lines of software products in the software industry has made the software product line concept viable. As a result of its popularity, a methodology is required for the process assessment of software product lines. Although researchers and practitioners understand that current software process assessment approaches cannot be directly applied to assess the software product line process, apart from some initial conceptual work, no direct methodology has yet been proposed. The primary purpose of this research is to study the software product line process and to put forward a Process Maturity Model for Software Product Line in order to fill the research gap of a process maturity assessment methodology. The maturity models for business, organization, and architecture are proposed in this research so as to cover the three essential dimensions of the software product line process. Three separate empirical investigations are conducted to determine certain key factors that contribute to and have an impact on the performance of the business, organization, and architecture dimensions of the software product line. The methodology to evaluate an organization's maturity profile once the assessment results of the individual dimensions like business, architecture, process, and organization are evident is also an integral feature of this  Process Maturity Model for Software Product Line. This work further contributes to defining the overall maturity level scales for the software product line process. The Process Maturity Model for Software Product Line will assist organizations in carrying out process assessment of the software product line in order to determine the capability of the organization to define, manage, and control the software product line process.

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) engineering is a software engineering paradigm that exploits the commonality between similar software products to reduce life cycle costs and time-to-market. Many SPLs are critical and would benefit from efficient verification through model checking. Model checking SPLs is more difficult than for single systems, since the number of different products is potentially huge. In previous work, we introduced Featured Transition Systems (FTS), a formal, compact representation of SPL behaviour, and provided efficient algorithms to verify FTS. Yet, we still face the state explosion problem, like any model checking-based verification. Model abstraction is the most relevant answer to state explosion. In this paper, we define a novel simulation relation for FTS and provide an algorithm to compute it. We extend well-known simulation preservation properties to FTS and thus lay the theoretical foundations for abstraction-based model checking of SPLs. We evaluate our approach by comparing the cost of FTS-based simulation and abstraction with respect to product-by-product methods. Our results show that FTS are a solid foundation for simulation-based model checking of SPL.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is about producing a set of similar products in a certain domain. A variability model documents the variability amongst products in a product line. The specification of variability can be extended with quality information, such as measurable quality attributes (e.g., CPU and memory consumption) and constraints on these attributes (e.g., memory consumption should be in a range of values). However, the wrong use of constraints may cause anomalies in the specification which must be detected (e.g., the model could represent no products). Furthermore, based on such quality information, it is possible to carry out quality-aware analyses, i.e., the product line engineer may want to verify whether it is possible to build a product that satisfies a desired quality. The challenge for quality-aware specification and analysis is threefold. First, there should be a way to specify quality information in variability models. Second, it should be possible to detect anomalies in the variability specification associated with quality information. Third, there should be mechanisms to verify the variability model to extract useful information, such as the possibility to build a product that fulfils certain quality conditions (e.g., is there any product that requires less than 512 MB of memory?). In this article, we present an approach for quality-aware analysis in software product lines using the orthogonal variability model (OVM) to represent variability. We propose to map variability represented in the OVM associated with quality information to a constraint satisfaction problem and to use an off-the-shelf constraint programming solver to automatically perform the verification task. To illustrate our approach, we use a product line in the automotive domain which is an example that was created in a national project by a leading car company. We have developed a prototype tool named FaMa-OVM, which works as a proof of concepts. We were able to identify void models, dead and false optional elements, and check whether the product line example satisfies quality conditions.},

abstract = {ContextPrevious work by researchers on 3years of early data for an Eclipse product has identified some predictors of failure-prone files that work well. Eclipse has also been used previously by researchers to study characteristics of product line software. ObjectiveThe work reported here investigates whether classification-based prediction of failure-prone files improves as the product line evolves. MethodThis investigation first repeats, to the extent possible, the previous study and then extends it by including four more recent years of data, comparing the prominent predictors with the previous results. The research then looks at the data for three additional Eclipse products as they evolve over time. The analysis compares results from three different types of datasets with alternative data collection and prediction periods. ResultsOur experiments with a variety of learners show that the difference between the performance of J48, used in this work, and the other top learners is not statistically significant. Furthermore, new results show that the effectiveness of classification significantly depends on the data collection period and prediction period. The study identifies change metrics that are prominent predictors across all four releases of all four products in the product line for the three different types of datasets. From the product line perspective, prediction of failure-prone files for the four products studied in the Eclipse product line shows statistically significant improvement in accuracy but not in recall across releases. ConclusionAs the product line matures, the learner performance improves significantly for two of the three datasets, but not for prediction of post-release failure-prone files using only pre-release change data. This suggests that it may be difficult to detect failure-prone files in the evolving product line. At least in part, this may be due to the continuous change, even for commonalities and high-reuse variation components, which we previously have shown to exist.},

abstract = {One expected characteristic in modern systems is self-adaptation, the capability of monitoring and reacting to changes into the environment. A particular case of self-adaptation is affective-driven self-adaptation. Affective-driven self-adaptation is about having consciousness of user’s affects (emotions) and drive self-adaptation reacting to changes in those affects. Most of the previous work around self-adaptive systems deals with performance, resources, and error recovery as variables that trigger a system reaction. Moreover, most effort around affect recognition has been put towards offline analysis of affect, and to date only few applications exist that are able to infer user’s affect in real-time and trigger self-adaptation mechanisms. In response to this deficit, this work proposes a software product line approach to jump-start the development of affect-driven self-adaptive systems by offering the definition of a domain-specific architecture, a set of components (organized as a framework), and guidelines to tailor those components. Study cases with systems for learning and gaming will confirm the capability of the software product line to provide desired functionalities and qualities.},

abstract = {Software companies need to provide a large set of features satisfying functional and non-functional requirements of diverse customers, thereby leading to variability in space. Feature location techniques have been proposed to support software maintenance and evolution in space. However, so far only one feature location technique also analyses the evolution in time of system variants, which is required for feature enhancements and bug fixing. Specifically, existing tools for managing a set of systems over time do not offer proper support for keeping track of feature revisions, updating existing variants, and creating new product configurations based on feature revisions. This paper presents four challenges concerning such capabilities for feature (revision) location and composition of new product configurations based on feature/s (revisions). We also provide a benchmark containing a ground truth and support for computing metrics. We hope that this will motivate researchers to provide and evaluate tool-supported approaches aiming at managing systems evolving in space and time. Further, we do not limit the evaluation of techniques to only this benchmark: we introduce and provide instructions on how to use a benchmark extractor for generating ground truth data for other systems. We expect that the feature (revision) location techniques maximize information retrieval in terms of precision, recall, and F-score, while keeping execution time and memory consumption low.},

abstract = {In theory, software product line engineering has reached a mature state. In practice though, implementing a variability management approach remains a tough case-by-case challenge for any organization. To tame the complexity of this undertaking, it is inevitable to handle variability from multiple perspectives and to manage variability consistently across artifacts, tools, and workflows. Especially, a solid understanding and management of the requirements to be met by the products is an inevitable prerequisite. In this article, we share experiences from the ongoing incremental adoption of explicit variability management at TRW Automotive's department for automotive slip control systems--located in Koblenz, Germany. On the technical side, the three key drivers of this adoption effort are (a) domain modeling and scoping, (b) handling of variability in requirements and (c) tighter integration of software engineering focus areas (e.g., domain modeling, requirements engineering, architectural modeling) to make use of variability-related data. In addition to implementation challenges with using and integrating concrete third-party tools, social and workflow-related issues are covered as well. The lessons learned are presented, discussed, and thoroughly compared with the state of the art in research.},

abstract = {Feature location is a traceability recovery activity to identify the implementation elements associated to a characteristic of a system. Besides its relevance for software maintenance of a single system, feature location in a collection of systems received a lot of attention as a first step to re-engineer system variants (created through clone-and-own) into a Software Product Line (SPL). In this context, the objective is to unambiguously identify the boundaries of a feature inside a family of systems to later create reusable assets from these implementation elements. Among all the case studies in the SPL literature, variants derived from ArgoUML SPL stands out as the most used one. However, the use of different settings, or the omission of relevant information (e.g., the exact configurations of the variants or the way the metrics are calculated), makes it difficult to reproduce or benchmark the different feature location techniques even if the same ArgoUML SPL is used. With the objective to foster the research area on feature location, we provide a set of common scenarios using ArgoUML SPL and a set of utils to obtain metrics based on the results of existing and novel feature location techniques.},

abstract = {Model-based product line engineering applies the reuse practices from product line engineering with graphical modeling for the specification of software intensive systems. Variability is usually described in separate variability models, while the implementation of the variable systems is specified in system models that use modeling languages such as SysML. Most of the SysML modeling tools with variability support, implement the annotation-based modeling approach. Annotated product line models tend to be error-prone since the modeler implicitly describes every possible variant in a single system model. To identifying variability-related inconsistencies, in this paper, we firstly define restrictions on the use of SysML for annotative modeling in order to avoid situations where resulting instances of the annotated model may contain ambiguous model constructs. Secondly, inter-feature constraints are extracted from the annotated model, based on relations between elements that are annotated with features. By analyzing the constraints, we can identify if the combined variability- and system model can result in incorrect or ambiguous instances. The evaluation of our prototype implementation shows the potential of our approach by identifying inconsistencies in the product line model of our industrial partner which went undetected through several iterations of the model.},

abstract = {We propose to integrate performance analysis in the early phases of the model-driven development process for Software Product Lines (SPL). We start with a multi-view UML model of the core family assets representing the commonality and variability between different products, which we call the SPL model. We add another perspective to the SPL model, annotating it with generic performance specifications expressed in the standard UML profile MARTE, recently adopted by OMG. The runtime performance of a product is affected by factors contained in the UML model of the product (derived from the SPL model), but also by external factors depending on the implementation and execution environments. The external factors not contained in the SPL model need to be eventually represented in the performance model. In order to do so, we propose to represent the variability space of different possible implementation and execution environments through a so called "performance completion (PC) feature model". These PC features are mapped to MARTE performance-related stereotypes and attributes attached to the SPL model elements. A first model transformation realized in the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) derives the UML model of a specific product with concrete MARTE annotations from the SPL model. A second transformation generates a Layered Queueing Network (LQN) performance model for the given product by applying an existing transformation named PUMA, developed in previous work. The proposed technique is illustrated with an e-commerce case study. A LQN model is derived for a product and the impact of different levels of secure communication channels on its performance is analyzed by using the LQN model.},

abstract = {Dealing with variability, during Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE), means trying to allow software engineers to develop a set of similar applications based on a manageable range of variable functionalities according to expert users’ needs. Particularly, variability management (VM) is an activity that allows flexibility and a high level of reuse during software development. In the last years, we have witnessed a proliferation of methods, techniques and supporting tools for VM in general, and for its analysis in particular. More precisely, a specific field has emerged, named (automated) variability analysis, focusing on verifying variability models across the SPLE’s phases. In this paper, we introduce a systematic literature review of existing proposals (as primary studies) focused on analyzing variability models. We define a classification framework, which is composed of 20 sub-characteristics addressing general aspects, such as scope and validation, as well as model-specific aspects, such as variability primitives, reasoner type. The framework allows to look at the analysis of variability models during its whole life cycle—from design to derivation—according to the activities involved during an SPL development. Also, the framework helps us answer three research questions defined for showing the state of the art and drawing challenges for the near future. Among the more interesting challenges, we can highlight the needs of more applications in industry, the existence of more mature tools, and the needs of providing more semantics in the way of variability primitives for identifying inconsistencies in the models.},

abstract = {ContextVariability management (VM) is one of the most important activities of software product-line engineering (SPLE), which intends to develop software-intensive systems using platforms and mass customization. VM encompasses the activities of eliciting and representing variability in software artefacts, establishing and managing dependencies among different variabilities, and supporting the exploitation of the variabilities for building and evolving a family of software systems. Software product line (SPL) community has allocated huge amount of effort to develop various approaches to dealing with variability related challenges during the last two decade. Several dozens of VM approaches have been reported. However, there has been no systematic effort to study how the reported VM approaches have been evaluated. ObjectiveThe objectives of this research are to review the status of evaluation of reported VM approaches and to synthesize the available evidence about the effects of the reported approaches. MethodWe carried out a systematic literature review of the VM approaches in SPLE reported from 1990s until December 2007. ResultsWe selected 97 papers according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected papers appeared in 56 publication venues. We found that only a small number of the reviewed approaches had been evaluated using rigorous scientific methods. A detailed investigation of the reviewed studies employing empirical research methods revealed significant quality deficiencies in various aspects of the used quality assessment criteria. The synthesis of the available evidence showed that all studies, except one, reported only positive effects. ConclusionThe findings from this systematic review show that a large majority of the reported VM approaches have not been sufficiently evaluated using scientifically rigorous methods. The available evidence is sparse and the quality of the presented evidence is quite low. The findings highlight the areas in need of improvement, i.e., rigorous evaluation of VM approaches. However, the reported evidence is quite consistent across different studies. That means the proposed approaches may be very beneficial when they are applied properly in appropriate situations. Hence, it can be concluded that further investigations need to pay more attention to the contexts under which different approaches can be more beneficial.},

This is the first study to demonstrate the relationships between the key business factors and software product lines. The results provide evidence that organizations in the business of software product line development have to cope with multiple key business factors to improve the overall performance of the business, in addition to their efforts in software development.

It supports different developer roles and allows the separation of two different kinds of dynamic variability at design-time: (i) variability related to the system operation, and (ii) variability associated with QoS. The former provides robustness to contingencies, maintaining a high success rate in task fulfillment. The latter focuses on the quality of the application execution (defined in terms of non-functional properties like safety or task efficiency) under changing situations and limited resources.

abstract = {When variability is implemented into a single variability-rich system with object-oriented techniques (e.g., inheritance, overloading, design patterns), the variation points and variants usually do not align with the domain features. It is then very hard and time consuming to manually identify these variation points to manage variability at the implementation level. symfinder is a toolchain to automatically identify and visualize these variability implementation locations inside a single object-oriented code base. For the identification part, it relies on the notion of symmetry between classes or methods to characterize uniformly some implementation techniques such as inheritance, overloading, or design patterns like Factory. The toolchain also generates an interactive Web-based visualization in which classes that are variation points are nodes linked together through their inheritance relationships, while the size, color, and texture of the nodes are used to represent some metrics on the number of overloaded constructors or methods. As a result, the visualization enables one to discern zones of interest where variation points are strongly present and to get relevant information over concerned classes. The toolchain, publicly available with its source code and an online demo, has been applied to several large open source projects.},

Hence, a core asset is a key element of PLE, and therefore the reusability of the core asset largely determines the success of PLE projects. However, current quality models to evaluate reusability do not adequately address the unique characteristics of core assets in PLE. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for evaluating the reusability of core assets. We first identify the key characteristics of core assets, and derive a set of quality attributes that characterizes the reusability of core assets. Then, we define metrics for each quality attribute and finally present practical guidelines for applying the evaluation framework in PLE projects. Using the proposed framework, the reusability of core assets can be more effectively and precisely evaluated.},

Over the last decade, the substantial benefits of SPL practices have been extensively documented and corroborated both in academia and industry. Several architecture methods have been proposed that employ different artifacts for expressing the components of a SPL, their properties and relationships. Of crucial importance for any SPL architecture method is to guarantee that the variability, for instance as expressed in feature models, is not only preserved but also kept consistent across all artifacts used. In this research challenge paper we argue that Safe Composition - the guarantee that all programs of a product line are type safe - can be leveraged to address this guarantee for structural properties of SPL architectures and the challenges that that entails.},

abstract = {A software product line is a family of programs where each program is defined by a unique combination of features. Product lines, like conventional programs, can be checked for safety properties through execution monitoring. However, because a product line induces a number of programs that is potentially exponential in the number of features, it would be very expensive to use existing monitoring techniques: one would have to apply those techniques to every single program. Doing so would also be wasteful because many programs can provably never violate the stated property. We introduce a monitoring technique dedicated to product lines that, given a safety property, statically determines the feature combinations that cannot possibly violate the property, thus reducing the number of programs to monitor. Experiments show that our technique is effective, particularly for safety properties that crosscut many optional features.},

abstract = {Product line-based software engineering is a paradigm that models the commonalities and variabilities of different applications of a given domain of interest within a unique framework and enhances rapid and low cost development of new applications based on reuse engineering principles. Despite the numerous advantages of software product lines, it is quite challenging to comprehensively test them. This is due to the fact that a product line can potentially represent many different applications; therefore, testing a single product line requires the test of its various applications. Theoretically, a product line with n software features can be a source for the development of 2n application. This requires the test of 2n applications if a brute-force comprehensive testing strategy is adopted. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary testing approach based on Genetic Algorithms to explore the configuration space of a software product line feature model in order to automatically generate test suites. We will show through the use of several publicly-available product line feature models that the proposed approach is able to generate test suites of O(n) size complexity as opposed to O(2n) while at the same time form a suitable tradeoff balance between error coverage and feature coverage in its generated test suites.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines Engineering (SPLE) is a software development approach intended for the development and maintenance of variable systems, i.e. systems that exist in many different variants. In the long run SPLE has many advantages. However, it requires a large upfront investment of time and money, which is why in practice Software Product Lines (SPLs) are rarely developed from scratch. Instead, they are often built using an extractive approach by which a set of existing system variants is consolidated (i.e. reverse engineered) into an SPL. A crucial part of this process is the construction of a variability model like a Feature Model (FM) that describes the common and variable parts of the system variants. In this paper we apply an approach for reverse engineering feature models based on a multi-objective optimization algorithm to the given challenge of constructing a feature model for a set of game variants and we present the results.},

abstract = {Creating and managing valid configurations is one of the main tasks in software product line engineering. Due to the often complex constraints from a feature model, some kind of automated configuration generation is required to facilitate the configuration process for users and developers. For instance, decision propagation can be applied to support users in configuring a product from a software product line (SPL) with less manual effort and error potential, leading to a semi-automatic configuration process. Furthermore, fully-automatic configuration processes, such as random sampling or t-wise interaction sampling can be employed to test or to optimize an SPL. However, current techniques for automated configuration generation still do not scale well to SPLs with large and complex feature models. Within our thesis, we identify current challenges regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of the semi- and fully-automatic configuration process and aim to address these challenges by introducing novel techniques and improving current ones. Our preliminary results show already show promising progress for both, the semi- and fully-automatic configuration process.},

Assuring that the investment in reuse holds over time is an important requirement in this case. To that end it is necessary that evolution is carefully managed: Changes in reusable assets and their customized instances need to be tracked and propagated efficiently. Configuration Management is a mature discipline for that purpose. However traditional configuration management does not address product line evolution scenarios explicitly. Over time this can lead to great evolution management effort. This paper presents an infrastructure - in particular its validation - that sits on top of traditional configuration management and is tailored to evolution scenarios in Product Line Engineering.

abstract = {A large number of software product lines (SPL) in practice are not constructed from scratch, but reengineered from legacy variant products. In order to transfer legacy products to SPL core assets, reverse variability analysis should be involved to find commonality and differences among variant artifacts. In this paper we concentrate on the recovery of SPL framework which can be represented by an object-oriented design model with variation points. We propose a semi-automatic SPL framework recovery approach with the assumption that involved legacy products have similar designs and implementations. In this approach, we adopt a bottom-up process based on clone detection and context analysis to identify corresponding mappings among design elements in different products. Then we use a top-down process from class level to method level with some heuristic rules to determine the commonality/variability classification and the variability type for each design element. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a case study on an industrial product line and present comprehensive analysis and discussions on the results.},

abstract = {The quality of a software system can be measured by the extent to which it possesses a desired combination of quality attributes (QAs). While some QAs are achieved implicitly through the interaction of various functional components of the system, others (e.g., security) can be encapsulated in dedicated software components. These QAs are known as functional quality attributes (FQAs). As applications may require different FQAs, and each FQA can be composed of many concerns (e.g., access control and authentication), integrating FQAs is very complex and requires dedicated expertise. Software architects are required to manually define FQA components, identify appropriate points in their architecture where to weave them, and verify that the composition of these FQA components with the other components is correct. This is a complex and error prone process. In our previous work we defined reusable FQAs by encapsulating them as aspectual architecture models that can be woven into a base architecture. So far, the joinpoints for weaving had to be identified manually. This made it difficult for software architects to verify that they have woven all the necessary FQAs into all the right places. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing a notion of contract for FQAs so that the correct application of an FQA (or one of its concerns) can be checked or, alternatively, appropriate binding points can be identified and proposed to the software architect automatically.},

abstract = {The concept of variability is fundamental in software product lines and a successful implementation of a product line largely depends on how well domain requirements and their variability are specified, managed, and realized. While developing an educational software product line, we identified a lack of support to specify variability in quality concerns. To address this problem we propose an approach to model variability in quality concerns, which is an extension of quality attribute scenarios. In particular, we propose domain quality attribute scenarios, which extend standard quality attribute scenarios with additional information to support specification of variability and deriving product specific scenarios. We demonstrate the approach with scenarios for robustness and upgradability requirements in the educational software product line.},

abstract = {The cost of a Software Product Line (SPL) development project sometimes exceeds the initially planned cost, because of requirements volatility and poor quality. In this paper, we propose a cost overrun simulation model for time-boxed SPL development. The model is an enhancement of a previous model, specifically now including: consideration of requirements volatility, consideration of unplanned work for defect correction during product projects, and nominal project cost overrun estimation. The model has been validated through stochastic simulations with fictional SPL project data, by comparing generated unplanned work effort to actual change effort, and by sensitivity analysis. The result shows that the proposed model has reasonable validity to estimate nominal project cost overruns and its variability. Analysis indicates that poor management of requirements and quality will almost double estimation error, for the studied simulation settings.},

To mitigate the potential risks of the transition to SPLE, several studies have been proposed that include many different rules for analyzing the feasibility of the SPLE adoption and the selection of transition process. However, it is not easy to apply these manually and likewise provide a proper decision with the corresponding justification. In this paper, we propose the tool Transit-PL, a web based decision support system for analyzing the feasibility of SPLE for an organization and selecting the appropriate transition strategy. Transit-PL provides a framework to build particular decision support system for selected strategies using different types of questions and corresponding rules and set of answers.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) have been around since the late 1970s and have established themselves as a way to deal with product variability. Tens of companies around the globe can pay testament to their advantages. Practitioners, however, have lamented the lack of data on other practitioners' experiences that would help them in the SPL journey. This work intends to analyze the application of SPLs in industry in the last 20 years. We departed from 194 industrial studies that were published at the Software Product Line Conference, the premier venue for SPL research. After the filtering process we selected 66 primary studies, from 43 different companies and 15 countries. The studies were classified to answer three research questions: (i) which contexts have SPLs been applied in?, (ii) what phenomena have been reported? and, (iii) what evidences have been collected in terms of obtained benefits, encountered issues and lessons learned? Regarding the context, SPLs have mainly been reported in USA and Germany (50%) and are used to develop embedded systems (76%). The most cited reason to adopt SPLs is the need to increase product variants (42.42%). As for the phenomena, the most reported problem area is adoption (39.39%). Last, as for evidences the most cited benefit is a cost reduction (53.03%), the issue is evolution (13.13%) and the learned lesson is that architecture is essential (24.24%). We believe the findings will be of interest to the community as a whole in quest to bridge the gap between industry and academia while balancing rigor, authenticity and relevance.},

abstract = {The possible variability of project delay is useful information to understand and mitigate the project delay risk. However, it is not sufficiently considered in the literature concerning effort estimation and simulation in software product line development. In this paper, we propose a project delay simulation model by introducing a random variable to represent the variability of adaptive rework. The model has been validated through stochastic simulations by comparing generated adaptive rework to an actual change effort distribution, and by sensitivity analysis. The result shows that the proposed model is capable of producing reasonable variability of adaptive rework, and consequently, variability of project delay. Analysis of our model indicates that the strength of dependency has a larger impact than the number of residual defects, for the studied simulation settings. However, high levels of adaptive rework variability did not have great impact on overall project delay.},

abstract = {The Logistics Specification and Analysis Tool (LSAT) is a modelbased engineering tool used for design-space exploration of flexible manufacturing systems. LSAT provides domain specific languages to model a manufacturing system and means to analyze the productivity characteristics of such a system. In LSAT, developers can specify a system and model its deterministic operations as a set of activities. Given a set of activities, it is possible to construct an individual activity sequence that represents one valid system execution, and with minor variations in the specification individual systems can be obtained. To avoid modeling each variant separately, which means cloning and maintaining the common parts, new functionality is needed to deal with the variability of system specifications. In this study, we aim to establish integration between LSAT and product line engineering techniques. Specifically, we provide a realization of a toolchain including variability representation of LSAT realization artifacts and automated variant derivation for the LSAT model variants. Delta modeling, a transformational variability realization mechanism, is employed to model the variability within LSAT realization artifacts. Using the toolchain, we develop an industry-related case for a product line, the so called Extended Twilight System, a Cyber Physical System (CPS) inspired by the CPSs of our industrial partner.},

abstract = {Software fault localization is one of the most expensive, tedious, and time-consuming activities in program debugging. This activity becomes even much more challenging in Software Product Line (SPL) systems due to the variability of failures in SPL systems. These unexpected behaviors are caused by variability faults which can only be exposed under some combinations of system features. Although localizing bugs in non-configurable code has been investigated in-depth, variability fault localization in SPL systems still remains mostly unexplored. To approach this challenge, we propose a benchmark for variability fault localization with a large set of 1,570 buggy versions of six SPL systems and baseline variability fault localization performance results. Our hope is to engage the community to propose new and better approaches to the problem of variability fault localization in SPL systems.},

abstract = {Managing variability is a challenging issue in software-product-line engineering. A key part of variability management is the ability to express explicitly the relationship between variability models (expressing the variability in the problem space, for example using feature models) and other artefacts of the product line, for example, requirements models and architecture models. Once these relations have been made explicit, they can be used for a number of purposes, most importantly for product derivation, but also for the generation of trace links or for checking the consistency of a product-line architecture. This paper bootstraps techniques from product-line engineering to produce a family of languages for variability management for easing the creation of new members of the family of languages. We show that developing such language families is feasible and demonstrate the flexibility of our language family by applying it to the development of two variability-management languages.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software products, which usually provide a large number of feature combinations, a fact that poses a unique set of challenges for software testing. Recently, many SPL testing approaches have been proposed, among them pair wise combinatorial techniques that aim at selecting products to test based on the pairs of feature combinations such products provide. These approaches regard SPL testing as an optimization problem where either coverage (maximize) or test suite size (minimize) are considered as the main optimization objective. Instead, we take a multi-objective view where the two objectives are equally important. In this exploratory paper we propose a zero-one mathematical linear program for solving the multi-objective problem and present an algorithm to compute the true Pareto front, hence an optimal solution, from the feature model of a SPL. The evaluation with 118 feature models revealed an interesting trade-off between reducing the number of constraints in the linear program and the runtime which opens up several venues for future research.},

abstract = {Agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) has provided powerful and natural, high-level abstractions in which software developers can understand, model and develop complex, distributed systems. Yet, the realization of AOSE partially depends on whether agent-based software systems can achieve reductions in development time and cost similar to other reuse-conscious development methods. Specifically, AOSE does not adequately address requirements specifications as reusable assets. Software product line engineering is a reuse technology that supports the systematic development of a set of similar software systems through understanding, controlling, and managing their common, core characteristics and their differing variation points. In this article, we present an extension to the Gaia AOSE methodology, named Gaia-PL (Gaia-Product Line), for agent-based distributed software systems that enables requirements specifications to be easily reused. We show how our methodology uses a product line perspective to promote reuse in agent-based software systems early in the development life cycle so that software assets can be reused throughout system development and evolution. We also present results from an application to show how Gaia-PL provided reuse that reduced the design and development effort for a large, multiagent system.},

To migrate a family of legacy software products into SPL for effective reuse, one has to understand commonality and variability among existing products variants. The existing techniques rely on manual identification and modeling of variability, and the analysis based on those techniques is performed at several mutually independent levels of abstraction. We propose a sandwich approach that consolidates feature knowledge from top-down domain analysis with bottom-up analysis of code similarities in subject software products. Our proposed method integrates model differencing, clone detection, and information retrieval techniques, which can provide a systematic means to reengineer the legacy software products into SPL based on automatic variability analysis.},

This versatile component is integrated into a number of automotive applications with varying safety requirements (e.g., windshield wipers and brake pedals).This paper provides a detailed explanation as to why the process of safety assessment and verification of the Hall Effect sensor is currently cumbersome and repetitive: it must be repeated entirely for every automotive application in which the sensor is to be used. In addition, no support is given to the engineer to select and configure the appropriate safety solutions and to explain the safety implications of his decisions.To address these problems, we present a tailored SPLE-based approach that combines model-driven development with advanced model composition techniques for applying and reasoning about specific safety solutions. In addition, we provide insights about how this approach can reduce the overall complexity, improve reusability, and facilitate safety assessment of the Hall Effect sensor.},

abstract = {Software product lines are widely used in the software industries to increase the re-usability and to decrease maintenance cost. On the other hand, systematic reviews are widely used in the software engineering research community to provide the overview of the research field and practitioners guidelines. Researchers have conducted many systematic studies on the different aspects of SPLs. To the best of our knowledge, till now there is no tertiary study conducted on systematic studies of SPL related research topics. In this paper, we aim at conducting a systematic mapping study of existing systematic studies to report the overview of the findings for researchers and practitioners. We performed snowballing and automated search to find out the relevant systematic studies. As a result, we analyzed 60 relevant studies to answer 5 research questions. The main focus of this tertiary study is to highlight the research topics, type of published reviews, active researchers and publication forums. Additionally, we highlight some of the limitations of the systematic studies. The important finding of this study is that the research field is well matured as the systematic studies covered a wide range of research topics. Another important finding is that many studies provided information for practitioners as well as researchers which is a notable improvement in the systematic reviews. However, many studies failed to assess the quality of the primary studies which is the major limitation of the existing systematic studies.},

abstract = {The proper configuration of systems has become a fundamental factor to avoid cybersecurity risks. Thereby, the analysis of cybersecurity vulnerabilities is a mandatory task, but the number of vulnerabilities and system configurations that can be threatened is extremely high. In this paper, we propose a method that uses software product line techniques to analyse the vulnerable configuration of the systems. We propose a solution, entitled AMADEUS, to enable and support the automatic analysis and testing of cybersecurity vulnerabilities of configuration systems based on feature models. AMADEUS is a holistic solution that is able to automate the analysis of the specific infrastructures in the organisations, the existing vulnerabilities, and the possible configurations extracted from the vulnerability repositories. By using this information, AMADEUS generates automatically the feature models, that are used for reasoning capabilities to extract knowledge, such as to determine attack vectors with certain features. AMADEUS has been validated by demonstrating the capacities of feature models to support the threat scenario, in which a wide variety of vulnerabilities extracted from a real repository are involved. Furthermore, we open the door to new applications where software product line engineering and cybersecurity can be empowered.},

abstract = {Although Software Product Lines are recurrently praised as an efficient paradigm for systematic reuse, practical adoption remains challenging. For bottom-up Software Product Line adoption, where a set of artefact variants already exists, practitioners lack end-to-end support for chaining (1) feature identification, (2) feature location, (3) feature constraints discovery, as well as (4) reengineering approaches. This challenge can be overcome if there exists a set of principles for building a framework to integrate various algorithms and to support different artefact types. In this paper, we propose the principles of such a framework and we provide insights on how it can be extended with adapters, algorithms and visualisations enabling their use in different scenarios. We describe its realization in BUT4Reuse (Bottom--Up Technologies for Reuse) and we assess its generic and extensible properties by implementing a variety of extensions. We further empirically assess the complexity of integration by reproducing case studies from the literature. Finally, we present an experiment where users realize a bottom-up Software Product Line adoption building on the case study of Eclipse variants.},

abstract = {Context: In large software organizations with a product line development approach, system test planning and scope selection is a complex task. Due to repeated testing: across different testing levels, over time (test for regression) as well as of different variants, the risk of redundant testing is large as well as the risk of overlooking important tests, hidden by the huge amount of possible tests. Aims: This study assesses the amount and type of overlaid manual testing across feature, integration and system test in such context, it explores the causes of potential redundancy and elaborates on how to provide decision support in terms of visualization for the purpose of avoiding redundancy. Method: An in-depth case study was launched including both qualitative and quantitative observations. Results: A high degree of test overlay is identified originating from distributed test responsibilities, poor documentation and structure of test cases, parallel work and insufficient delta analysis. The amount of test overlay depends on which level of abstraction is studied. Conclusions: Avoiding redundancy requires tool support, e.g. visualization of test design coverage, test execution progress, priorities of coverage items as well as visualized priorities of variants to support test case selection.},

abstract = {Product configuration based on a feature model in software product lines is the process of selecting the desired features based on customers’ requirements. In most cases, application engineers focus on the functionalities of the target product during product configuration process whereas the quality attributes are handled until the final product is produced. However, it is costly to fix the problem if the quality attributes have not been considered in the product configuration stage. The key issue of assessing a quality attribute of a product configuration is to measure the impact on a quality attribute made by the set of functional variable features selected in a configuration. Current existing approaches have several limitations, such as no quantitative measurements provided or requiring existing valid products and heavy human effort for the assessment. To overcome theses limitations, we propose an Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) based approach to estimate the relative importance of each functional variable feature on a quality attribute. Based on the relative importance value of each functional variable feature on a quality attribute, the level of quality attributes of a product configuration in software product lines can be assessed. An illustrative example based on the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) software product line is presented to demonstrate how the proposed approach works.},

abstract = {Process models for software product-line engineering focus on proactive adoption scenarios---that is, building product-line platforms from scratch. They comprise the two phases domain engineering (building a product-line platform) and application engineering (building individual variants), each of which defines various development activities. Established more than two decades ago, these process models are still the de-facto standard for steering the engineering of platforms and variants. However, observations from industrial and open-source practice indicate that the separation between domain and application engineering, with their respective activities, does not fully reflect reality. For instance, organizations rarely build platforms from scratch, but start with developing individual variants that are re-engineered into a platform when the need arises. Organizations also appear to evolve platforms by evolving individual variants, and they use contemporary development activities aligned with technical advances. Recognizing this discrepancy, we present an updated process model for engineering software product lines. We employ a method for constructing process theories, building on recent literature as well as our experiences with industrial partners to identify development activities and the orders in which these are performed. Based on these activities, we synthesize and discuss the new process model, called promote-pl. Also, we explain its relation to modern software-engineering practices, such as continuous integration, model-driven engineering, or simulation testing. We hope that our work offers contemporary guidance for product-line engineers developing and evolving platforms, and inspires researchers to build novel methods and tools aligned with current practice.},

abstract = {[Context &amp; Motivation] Developing new software systems based on a software product line (SPL) in so-called application engineering (AE) projects is still a time-consuming and expensive task. Especially when a large number of customer-specific requirements exists, there is still no systematic support for efficiently aligning these non-anticipated requirements with SPL characteristics early on. [Question/problem] In order to improve this process significantly, sound knowledge about an SPL must be available when guiding the requirements elicitation during AE. Thus, an appropriate reflection of SPL characteristics in process-supporting artifacts is indispensable for actually supporting a requirements engineer in this task. [Principal ideas/results] In this paper, a validated template for elicitation instructions that aims at providing a requirements engineer with knowledge about an underlying SPL in an appropriate manner is presented. This template consists of predefined text blocks and algorithms that explain how SPL-relevant product and process knowledge can be systematically reflected into capability-aware elicitation instructions. [Contribution] By using such elicitation instructions, requirements engineers are enabled to elicit requirements in an AE project more effectively.},

abstract = {Software Product Line has acquired a significant momentum at the end of the 1990ies since it allows the production of variable software systems corresponding to the same domain portfolio. The effectiveness of the derivation process depends on how well variability is defined and implemented which is a crucial topic area that was addressed among two essential trends: On the one hand, starting from Domain Specific Modelling Language to express domain requirements and automate the code generation with Model-Driven Engineering techniques and on the second hand, exploiting the soar of variability mechanisms.In this context, the current research presents a method that unifies the two aforementioned approaches to cover the overall strategies by defining a framework that allows a better code generation in terms of documentation, maintainability, rapidity,etc. The starting point is the usage of the Domain Specific Modelling Language to represent the stakeholders requirements. Then, the resulting meta-model will be converted into one our several Feature Diagrams on which variability mechanisms can be applied to generate all the family products.A preliminary experiment has been undertaken to design the methodology of the proposed software factory in a meta-model. The validation task was evaluated with an academic use case called HandiWeb developed to facilitate handicap persons access to the internet. The first results allow us to put the hand on the key challenges that must be resolved by the proposed methodology.},

abstract = {Configurable software systems can be adapted or configured according to a set of features to increase reuse and productivity. The testing process is essential because configurations that fail may potentially hurt user experience and degrade the reputation of a project. However, testing configurable systems is very challenging due to the number of configurations to run with each test, leading to a combinatorial explosion in the number of configurations and tests. Currently, several testing techniques and tools have been proposed to deal with this challenge, but their potential practical application remains mostly unexplored. To encourage the research area on testing configurable systems, researchers and practitioners should be able to try out their solutions in common datasets. In this paper, we propose a dataset with 22 configurable software systems and an extensive test suite. Moreover, we report failures found in these systems and source code metrics to allow evaluating candidate solutions. We hope to engage the community and stimulate new and existing approaches to the problem of testing configurable systems.},

abstract = {Software product line approaches can shorten time-to-market, reduce development efforts, and optimize resource usage. However, those benefits are not guaranteed in all situations. Before initiating a software product line, an organization needs to evaluate available process options to see which ones best fit its goals. During the execution of a product line process; an organization needs to measure the process to track its progress toward the planned goals and adjust the executed process if it is needed. Existing product line estimation approaches do not consider dynamics caused by time and events. Although software product line approaches have been used by many organizations, their benefits have not been systematically measured. This research aims to provide approaches and tools for predicting and measuring software product line processes. In this work, a software product line evolution management framework is proposed. The framework consists of a product line evolution management approach and a product line process management environment. The framework can assist process definition, enactment, and measurement. A prototype process management environment has been implemented. It can assist software product line process estimation and measurement.},

abstract = {Smart IT has an increasing influence on the control of daily life. For instance, smart grids manage power supply, autonomous automobiles take part in traffic, and assistive robotics support humans in production cells. We denote such systems as Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs), where cyber addresses the controlling software, while physical describes the controlled hardware. One key aspect of CPSs is their capability to adapt to new situations autonomously or with minimal human intervention. To achieve this, CPSs reuse, reorganize and reconfigure their components during runtime. Some components may even serve in different CPSs and different situations simultaneously. The hardware of a CPS usually consists of a heterogeneous set of variable components. While each component can be designed as a software product line (SPL), which is a well established approach to describe software and hardware variability, it is not possible to describe CPSs' variability solely on a set of separate, non-interacting product lines. To properly manage variability, a CPS must specify dependencies and interactions of its separate components and cope with variable environments, changing requirements, and differing safety properties. In this paper, we i) propose a classification of variability aspects, ii) point out current challenges in variability modeling, and iii) sketch open research questions. Overall, we aim to initiate new research directions for variable CPSs based on existing product-line techniques.},

abstract = {The Industry 4.0 initiative envisions the flexible and optimized production of customized products on Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) that consist of subsystems coordinated to conduct complex production processes. Hence, accurate CPPS modeling requires integrating the modeling of variability for Product-Process-Resource (PPR) aspects. Yet, current variability modeling approaches treat structural and behavioral variability separately, leading to inaccurate CPPS production models that impede CPPS engineering and optimization. This paper proposes a PhD project for integrated variability modeling of PPR aspects to improve the accuracy of production models with variability for CPPS engineers and production optimizers. The research project follows the Design Science approach aiming for the iterative design and evaluation of (a) a framework to categorize currently incomplete and scattered models and methods for PPR variability modeling as a foundation for an integrated model; and (b) a modeling approach for more accurate integrated PPR variability modeling. The planned research will provide the Software Product Line (SPL) and CPPS engineering research communities with (a) novel models, methods, and insights on integrated PPR variability modeling, (b) open data from CPPS engineering use cases for common modeling, and (c) empirical data from field studies for shared analysis and evaluation.},

To improve development efficiency, exploiting ECS commonalities and predicting their variability are mandatory. The concept of software product line engineering meets the business background of ECS. However, we should carefully investigate the expected technical, economical, and organizational effects of introducing this strategy into existing products.This paper explains an approach for assessing the potential of merging existing embedded software into a product line approach. The definition of an economically useful product line approach requires two things: analyzing return on investment (ROI) expectations of a product line and understanding the effort required for building reusable assets. We did a clone analysis to provide the basis for effort estimation for merge potential assessment of existing variants. We also report on a case study with ECS. We package the lessons learned and open issues that arose during the case study.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) engineering is a software development approach that takes advantage of the commonality and variability between products from a family, and supports the generation of specific products by reusing a set of core family assets. This paper proposes a UML model transformation approach for software product lines to derive a performance model for a specific product. The input to the proposed technique, the "source model", is a UML model of a SPL with performance annotations, which uses two separate profiles: a "product line" profile from literature for specifying the commonality and variability between products, and the MARTE profile recently standardized by OMG for performance annotations. The source model is generic and therefore its performance annotations must be parameterized. The proposed derivation of a performance model for a concrete product requires two steps: a) the transformation of a SPL model to a UML model with performance annotations for a given product, and b) the transformation of the outcome of the first step into a performance model. This paper focuses on the first step, whereas the second step will use the PUMA transformation approach of annotated UML models to performance models, developed in previous work. The output of the first step, named "target model", is a UML model with MARTE annotations, where the variability expressed in the SPL model has been analyzed and bound to a specific product, and the generic performance annotations have been bound to concrete values for the product. The proposed technique is illustrated with an e-commerce case study.},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework for model-based product lines of embedded systems. We show how to integrate model-based product line techniques into a consistent framework that can deal with large product lines as they are common in industry. The framework demonstrates the strengths of model-based techniques like abstraction, support for customised representations, and a high degree of automation. In particular, we provide the following contributions: (1) to shift existing product lines towards a model-based approach, we support the (semi-) automated extraction of models from existing requirement, test, and implementation artefacts; (2) to cope with the complexity of artefacts and their interrelations in industrial product lines, we support the generation of context-specific views. These views support developers, e.g., in analysing complex dependencies between different artefacts; (3) finally, we support automated product derivation based on an integrated hardware abstraction layer. Most of the presented concepts have been inspired by challenges arising in the industrial application of product line techniques in the model-based engineering of embedded systems. We report on experiences gathered during the application of the techniques to a prototypical product line (on a rapid prototyping platform in the university lab) and to industrial sample cases (at the industry partner).},

abstract = {Taxonomy-Based Software Construction (TABASCO) applies extensive domain analyses to create conceptual hierarchies of algorithmic domains. Those are used as basis for the implementation of software toolkits. The monolithic structure of TABASCO-based toolkits restricts their adoption on resource-constrained or special-purpose devices. In this paper, we address this problem by applying Software Product Line (SPL) techniques to TABASCO-based toolkits: We use software taxonomies as input to creating a conceptual representation of variability as feature models of an SPL. We apply the variability realization mechanism delta modeling to transform realization artifacts, such as source code, to only contain elements for a particular selection of features. Our method is suitable for proactive, reactive and extractive SPL development so that it supports a seamless adoption and evolution of an SPL approach for TABASCO-based toolkits. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method with three case studies by proactively, reactively and extractively transforming TABASCO-based toolkits to SPLs, which allow derivation of variants with custom-tailored functionality.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is one of the main techniques used in Software Product Line Engineering to manage the variability within the products of a family. Concrete products of the family can be generated through a configuration process. The configuration process selects and/or removes features from the feature model according to the stakeholders' requirements. Selecting the right set of features for one product from amongst all of the available features in the feature model is a complex task because: 1) the multiplicity of stakeholders' functional requirements; 2) the positive or negative impact of features on non-functional properties; and 3) the stakeholders' preferences w.r.t. the desirable non-functional properties of the final product. Many configurations techniques have already been proposed to facilitate automated product derivation. However, most of the current proposals are not designed to consider stakeholders' preferences and constraints especially with regard to non-functional properties. We address the software product line configuration problem and propose a framework, which employs an artificial intelligence planning technique to automatically select suitable features that satisfy both the stakeholders' functional and non-functional preferences and constraints. We also provide tooling support to facilitate the use of our framework. Our experiments show that despite the complexity involved with the simultaneous consideration of both functional and non-functional properties our configuration technique is scalable.},

abstract = {Feature models are recognized as a de facto standard for variability modeling. Presented almost three decades ago, dozens of different variations and extensions to the original feature-modeling notation have been proposed, together with hundreds of variability management techniques building upon feature models. Unfortunately, despite several attempts to establish a unified language, there is still no emerging consensus on a feature-modeling language that is both intuitive and simple, but also expressive enough to cover a range of important usage scenarios. There is not even a documented and commonly agreed set of such scenarios.Following an initiative among product-line engineering researchers in September 2018, we present 14 usage scenarios together with examples and requirements detailing each scenario. The scenario descriptions are the result of a systematic process, where members of the initiative authored original descriptions, which received feedback via a survey, and which we then refined and extended based on the survey results, reviewers' comments, and our own expertise. We also report the relevance of supporting each usage scenario for the language, as perceived by the initiative's members, prioritizing each scenario. We present a roadmap to build and implement a first version of the envisaged common language.},

abstract = {Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice widely adopted in the industry to allow frequent integration of code changes. During the CI process, many test cases are executed multiple times a day, subject to time constraints. In this scenario, a learning-based approach, named COLEMAN, has been successfully applied. COLEMAN allows earlier execution of the most promising test cases to reveal faults. This approach considers CI particularities such as time budget and volatility of test cases, related to the fact that test cases can be added/removed along the CI cycles. In the CI of Highly Configuration System (HCS), many product variants must be tested, each one with different configuration options, but having test cases that are common to or reused from other variants. In this context, we found, by analogy, another particularity, the volatility of variants, that is, some variants can be included/discontinued along CI cycles. Considering this context, this work introduces two strategies for the application of COLEMAN in the CI of HCS: the Variant Test Set Strategy (VTS) that relies on the test set specific for each variant, and the Whole Test Set Strategy (WST) that prioritizes the test set composed by the union of the test cases of all variants. Both strategies are evaluated in a real-world HCS, considering three test budgets. The results show that the proposed strategies are applicable regarding the time spent for prioritization. They perform similarly regarding early fault detection, but WTS better mitigates the problem of beginning without knowledge, and is more suitable when a new variant to be tested is added.},

abstract = {A key aspect for effective variability modeling of Software Product Lines (SPL) is to harmonize the need to achieve separation of concerns with the need to satisfy consistency of requirements and constraints. Techniques for variability modeling such as feature models used together with use scenarios help to achieve separation of stakeholders' concerns but ensuring their joint consistency is largely unsupported. Therefore, inconsistent assumptions about system's expected use scenarios and the way in which they vary according to the presence or absence of features reduce the models usefulness and possibly renders invalid SPL systems. In this paper we propose an approach to check consistency -- the verification of semantic relationships among the models -- between features and use scenarios that realize them. The novelty of this approach is that it is specially tailored for the SPL domain and considers complex composition situations where the customization of use scenarios for specific products depends on the presence or absence of sets of features. We illustrate our approach and supporting tools using variant constructs that specify how the inclusion of sets of variable features (that refer to uncommon requirements between products of a SPL) adapt use scenarios related to other features.},

abstract = {Development of software product lines relies heavily on the use of variability, and implementation of variability is not a trivial task. Preprocessor is an effective and quite simple way to realize variability, however, it lacks structure, makes programs hard to maintain and makes programs error-prone. Although preprocessor based variability can influence program comprehension, the relationship between software defects and the preprocessor based variability is not particularly clear. This paper statistically analyses preprocessor based software variability and software defects to verify whether high variability will increase software defect count. This paper defines a series of variability metrics and analyses the variability from different granularities to verify whether the high variability can cause high defect counts. Experimental results show that the software variability and its defects have statistically significant relationships.},

abstract = {Background: Previous research on three years of early data for an Eclipse product identified some predictors of failure-prone files that work well for that data set. Additionally, Eclipse has been used to explore characteristics of product line software in previous research.Aims: To assess whether change metrics are good predictors of failure-prone files over time for the family of products in the evolving Eclipse product line.Method: We repeat, to the extent possible, the decision tree portion of the prior study to assess our ability to replicate the method, and then extend it by including four more recent years of data. We compare the most prominent predictors with the previous study's results. We then look at the data for three additional Eclipse products as they evolved over time. We explore whether the set of good predictors change over time for one product and whether the set differs among products.Results: We find that change metrics are consistently good and incrementally better predictors across the evolving products in Eclipse. There is also some consistency regarding which change metrics are the best predictors.Conclusion: Change metrics are good predictors for failure-prone files for the Eclipse product line. A small subset of these change metrics is fairly stable and consistent across products and releases.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) are a well-accepted approach for self-adapting Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) at run-time. The DSPL approaches make decisions supported by performance models, which capture system features' contribution to one or more optimization goals. Combining performance models with Multi-Objectives Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) as decision-making mechanisms is common in DSPLs. However, MOEAs algorithms start solving the optimization problem from a randomly selected population, not finding good configurations fast enough after a context change, requiring too many resources so scarce in CPSs. Also, the DSPL engineer must deal with the hardware and software particularities of the target platform in each CPS deployment. And although each system instantiation has to solve a similar optimization problem of the DSPL, it does not take advantage of experiences gained in similar CPS. Transfer learning aims at improving the efficiency of systems by sharing the previously acquired knowledge and applying it to similar systems. In this work, we analyze the benefits of transfer learning in the context of DSPL and MOEAs testing on 8 feature models with synthetic performance models. Results are good enough, showing that transfer learning solutions dominate up to 71% of the non-transfer learning ones for similar DSPL.},

However, the interaction between horizontal scalability, feature variability and stringent performance and security concerns for these heterogeneous payment applications and stakeholders is not always clear, which creates tension (and sometimes interference) in the successful development of these services. In this work, we identify crucial non-functional requirements for payment services and present a simple framework to map these requirements to existing approaches to achieve both horizontal and vertical scalability. We report on experiences with applying a service line engineering (SLE) approach towards payment services that combines cloud computing and SPL to support feature customization in a multi tenant payment service. We conclude with practical experiences and several lessons learned after applying this SPL engineering methodology on our industrial e-payment use case.},

abstract = {The importance of cyber-physical systems is growing very fast, being part of the Internet of Things vision. These devices generate data that could collapse the network and can not be assumed by the cloud. New technologies like Mobile Cloud Computing and Mobile Edge Computing are taking importance as solution for this issue. The idea is offloading some tasks to devices situated closer to the user device, reducing network congestion and improving applications performance (e.g., in terms of latency and energy). However, the variability of the target devices' features and processing tasks' requirements is very diverse, being difficult to decide which device is more adequate to deploy and run such processing tasks. Once decided, task offloading used to be done manually. Then, it is necessary a method to automatize the task assignation and deployment process. In this thesis we propose to model the structural variability of the deployment infrastructure and applications using feature models, on the basis of a SPL engineering process. Combining SPL methodology with Edge Computing, the deployment of applications is addressed as the derivation of a product. The data of the valid configurations is used by a task assignment framework, which determines the optimal tasks offloading solution in different network devices, and the resources of them that should be assigned to each task/user. Our solution provides the most energy and latency efficient deployment solution, accomplishing the QoS requirements of the application in the process.},

In synthetic biology, living organisms are programmed to perform new functions or improve existing functions. These programs are designed and constructed using small building blocks made out of DNA. We conjecture that there are families of products that consist of common and variable DNA parts, and we can leverage product line engineering to help synthetic biologists build, evolve, and reuse these programs. As a first step towards this goal, we perform a domain engineering case study that leverages an open-source repository of more than 45,000 reusable DNA parts. We are able to identify features and their related artifacts, all of which can be composed to make different programs. We demonstrate that we can successfully build feature models representing families for two commonly engineered functions. We then analyze an existing synthetic biology case study and demonstrate how product line engineering can be beneficial in this domain.},

abstract = {Families of related MATLAB/Simulink systems commonly emerge ad hoc using clone-and-own practices. Extractively migrating systems towards a software product line (SPL) can be a remedy. A feature model (FM) represents all potential configurations of an SPL, ideally, in non-technical domain terms. However, yielding a sensible FM from automated synthesis remains a major challenge due to domain knowledge being a prerequisite for features to be adequate abstractions. In incremental reverse engineering, subsequent generation of FMs may further overwrite changes and design decisions made during previous manual FM refinement.In this paper, we propose an approach to largely automate the synthesis of a suitable FM from a set of cloned MATLAB/Simulink models as part of reverse engineering an SPL. We fully automate the extraction of an initial, i.e., a technical, FM that closely aligns with realization artifacts and their variability, and further provide operations to manually refine it to incorporate domain knowledge. Most importantly, we provide concepts to capture such operations and to replay them on a structurally different technical FM stemming from a subsequent reverse engineering increment that included further systems of the portfolio. We further provide an implementation and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using two MATLAB/Simulink data sets from the automotive domain.},

abstract = {Since the definition of feature models in 1990, a large number of language constructs have emerged. Each language construct usually comes with its own abstract and concrete syntax, its semantics, and even its complete language dialect and tool support. Nowadays, there is a consensus in the Software Product Line community about a need for defining a common variability modeling language. But the fact of the matter is that it is very complex to achieve a good compromise between how expressive the language should be and the effort of developing practical tools for a language with all possible language constructs. In this paper, we propose an extensible model-driven engineering approach for defining the abstract syntax of feature modeling language constructs that could be tailored to different needs and domains. We formalize our approach as a set of modular and reusable metamodels that allows practitioners to decide which subset of language constructs to use through: (1) generating a new variability language; and (2) managing feature models with different level of expressiveness. We provide an instantiation and implementation of our approach.},

abstract = {Several approaches to define Variability Models (VM) of non-functional requirements or quality attributes have been proposed. However, these approaches have focused on specific quality attributes rather than more general non-functional aspects established by standards such as ISO/IEC 25010 for software evaluation and quality. Thus, developing specific software products by selecting features and at the same time measuring the level of compliance with a standard/guideline is a challenge. In this work, we present the definition of an accessibility VM based on the web content accessibility guides (WCAG) 2.1 W3C recommendation, to obtain a quantitative measure to improve or construct specific SPL products that require to be accessibility-aware. This paper is specially focused on illustrating the experience of measuring the accessibility in a software product line (SPL) in order to check if it is viable measuring products and recommending improvements in terms of features before addressing the construction of accessibility-aware products. The adoption of the VM accessibility has been putted into practice through a pilot case study, the MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) initiative of the Universidad T\'{e}cnica Particular de Loja. The conduction of this pilot case study has allowed us to illustrate how it is possible to model and measure the accessibility in SPL using accessibility VM, as well as to recommend accessibility configuration improvements for the construction of new or updated MOOC platforms.},

abstract = {The specialization of the configuration space of a software system has been considered for targeting specific configuration profiles, usages, deployment scenarios, or hardware settings. The challenge is to find constraints among options' values that only retain configurations meeting a performance objective. Since the exponential nature of configurable systems makes a manual specialization unpractical, several approaches have considered its automation using machine learning, i.e., measuring a sample of configurations and then learning what options' values should be constrained. Even focusing on learning techniques based on decision trees for their built-in explainability, there is still a wide range of possible approaches that need to be evaluated, i.e., how accurate is the specialization with regards to sampling size, performance thresholds, and kinds of configurable systems. In this paper, we compare six learning techniques: three variants of decision trees (including a novel algorithm) with and without the use of model-based feature selection. We first perform a study on 8 configurable systems considered in previous related works and show that the accuracy reaches more than 90% and that feature selection can improve the results in the majority of cases. We then perform a study on the Linux kernel and show that these techniques performs as well as on the other systems. Overall, our results show that there is no one-size-fits-all learning variant (though high accuracy can be achieved): we present guidelines and discuss tradeoffs.},

abstract = {In SaaS applications, which are mainly built following a multi-tenant architecture, the support of service variability among tenants is limited. It is due to the principle of sharing the same instance of the SaaS service between the tenants; thus, the particularities of each tenant's needs are not considered. Having to customize and adapt a SaaS service to tenants' needs and their specific contexts, while maintaining multi-tenancy, has emerged as a persisting challenge. The SaaS service adaptation has not only to be according to the functional requirements of the different tenants, but it has also to cope with the non-functional requirements in their various levels that are subject to change in time and space: i.e. within the same tenant and between tenants, respectively. For example, a tenant can just require minimal security level as it needs solely to be authenticated and has no other security concerns; while another may require a high security level and advanced and supplementary security mechanisms such as access control and encryption. There are also situations when the same tenant changes its desired quality level through time; for instance, when there is an increase of service requests in a critical period, the tenant may want to decrease the response time and to increase the uptime value in order to smoothly perform his requests. Therefore, the application needs to be adapted dynamically in order to meet every tenant's quality requirements as if he is the only one to consume the service.Software Product Lines Engineering (SPLE) has largely tackled the variability management field in the literature. It enables high reusability in shorter time, at lower costs and with higher quality by creating product families or lines that share commonalities and have variation points. The derivation of the final product is performed at the level of those variation points while considering the inter-and intra- dependencies between the artifacts of a product line.Our proposed approach is based on the SPLE principles to build SaaS services tailored to tenant-specific Service Level Agreements (SLAs). We defined the Domain Engineering phase to build SLA families. Based on domain analysis, the non-functional requirements of the tenants, their commonalities, variation points and variants are captured and modeled. A Generic SLA is generated which contains the terms and the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of all the contracting tenants. From this Generic SLA, the proposed middleware generates core and tenant-specific policies. The Configurator, a middleware component, adapts the application according to these defined policies based on annotations in the form of key-value pairs.As contributions of our article [1]: we proposed the architecture of the proposed middleware and its different components; we defined the Policy metamodel, that models policies retrieved from the Generic SLA as annotations, and described the model-to-model transformations from VariableSLA metamodel to Policy metamodel; and we proposeed a Configurator metamodel that models and describes how the Configurator component of the middleware configures the SaaS service.Our approach differs from the literature in that it enables building a family of SLAs: a generic SLA and tenant-specific policies; linking, thus, the non-functional variability with the SLA. Moreover, it is not limited to a specific quality attribute but supports any quality attribute expressed in the SLA. It allows configurations at design time and at runtime through annotating the SaaS service components with adequate quality levels.},

Thus, economic models can help them to assess the worthiness of such an investment.Product Line Engineering (PLE) seems to be an attractive reuse approach in matter of product quality and time-to-market. Using Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) in a PLE approach may have a positive impact.This paper reports on the need for an economic model to quantify the predicted benefits of the PLE software development with the use of COTS components.

abstract = {Managing the evolution of system families in space and time, i.e., system variants and their revisions is still an open challenge. The software product line (SPL) approach can support the management of product variants in space by reusing a common set of features. However, feature changes over time are often necessary due to adaptations and/or bug fixes, leading to different product versions. Such changes are commonly tracked in version control systems (VCSs). However, VCSs only deal with the change history of source code, and, even though their branching mechanisms allow to develop features in isolation, VCS does not allow propagating changes across variants. Variation control systems have been developed to support more fine-grained management of variants and to allow tracking of changes at the level of files or features. However, these systems are also limited regarding the types and granularity of artifacts. Also, they are cognitively very demanding with increasing numbers of revisions and variants. Furthermore, propagating specific changes over variants of a system is still a complex task that also depends on the variability-aware change impacts. Based on these existing limitations, the goal of this doctoral work is to investigate and define a flexible and unified approach to allow an easy and scalable evolution of SPLs in space and time. The expected contributions will aid the management of SPL products and support engineers to reason about the potential impact of changes during SPL evolution. To evaluate the approach, we plan to conduct case studies with real-world SPLs.},

In this paper, we therefore introduce two approaches to measure and reduce the energy consumption of a SPL by analyzing a limited set of products sampled from this SPL. While the first approach relies on the analysis of individual feature consumptions, the second one takes feature interactions into account to better mitigate energy consumption of resulting products.Our experimental results on a real-world SPL indicate that both approaches succeed to produce significant energy improvements on a large number of products, while consumption data was modeled from a small set of sampled products. Furthermore, we show that taking feature interactions into account leads to more products improved with higher energy savings per product.},

abstract = {In model-driven engineering of applications, the quality of the software architecture is realized and preserved in the successive stages of its lifecycle through model transformations. However, limited support for reuse in contemporary model transformation techniques forces developers of product line architectures to reinvent transformation rules for every variant of the product line, which can adversely impact developer productivity and in turn degrade the quality of the resulting software architecture for the variant. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents the MTS (Model-transformation Templatization and Specialization generative transformation process, which promotes reuse in model transformations through parameterization and specialization of transformation rules. MTS defines two higher order transformations to capture the variability in transformation rules and to specialize them across product variants. The core idea behind MTS is realized within a graphical model transformation tool in a way that is minimally intrusive to the underlying tool's implementation. The paper uses two product line case studies to evaluate MTS in terms of reduction in efforts to define model transformation rules as new variants are added to the product line, and the overhead in executing the higher order transformations. These metrics provide an indirect measure of how potential degradation in the quality of software architectures of product lines caused due to lack of reuse can be alleviated by MTS.},

abstract = {Binary decision diagrams (BDD) have been proposed for numerous product-line analyses. These analyses typically exploit properties unique to decision diagrams, such as negation in constant time and space. Furthermore, the existence of a BDD representing the configuration space of a product line removes the need to employ SAT or #SAT solvers for their analysis. Recent work has shown that the performance of state-of-the-art BDD libraries is significantly lower than previously reported and hypothesized. In this work, we provide an assessment of the state-of-the-art of BDD scalability in this domain and explain why previous results on the scalability of BDDs do not apply to more recent product-line instances.},

abstract = {A large number of software products may be derived from an original single product. Although software product line engineering is advocated as an effective approach to maintaining such a family of products, re-engineering existing products requires developers to understand the evolution history of the products. This can be challenging because developers typically only have access to product source code. In this research, we propose to extract a Product Evolution Tree that approximates the evolution history from source code of products. Our key idea is that two successive products are the most similar to one another in the evolution history. We construct a Product Evolution Tree as a minimum spanning tree whose cost function is defined by the number of similar files between products. As an experiment, we extracted Product Evolution Trees from 6 datasets of open-source projects. The result showed that 53% to 92% of edges in the extracted trees were consistent with the actual evolution history of the projects.},

abstract = {Language development is inherently complex. With the support of a suitable language development environment most computer scientists could develop their own domain-specific language (DSL) with relative ease. Yet, when the DSL is the result of a configuration over a language product line (LPL)---a special software product line (SPL) of compilers/interpreters and corresponding IDE services---they fail to provide adequate support. An environment for LPL engineering should facilitate the underlying process involving three distinct roles: a language engineer developing the LPL, a language deployer configuring a language product, and a language user using the language product. Neither IDEs nor SPLE environments can cater all three roles and fully support the LPL engineering process with distributed, incremental development, configuration, and deployment of language variants. In this paper, we present an LPL engineering process for the distributed, incremental development of LPLs and an integrated language product line development environment supporting this process, catering the three roles, and ensuring the consistency among all artifacts of the LPL: language components implementing a language feature, the feature model, language configurations and the resulting language products. To create such an environment, we married the Neverlang language workbench and AiDE its LPL engineering environment with the FeatureIDE SPL engineering environment. While Neverlang supports the development of LPLs and deployment of language products, AiDE generates the feature model for the LPL under development, whereas FeatureIDE handles the feature configuration. We illustrate the applicability of the LPL engineering process and the suitability of our development environment for the three roles by showcasing its application for teaching programming with a growable language. In there, an LPL for Javascript was developed/refactored, 15 increasingly complex language products were configured/updated and finally deployed.},

abstract = {The Software Product Line (SPL) configuration field is an active area of research and has attracted both practitioners and researchers attention in the last years. A key part of an SPL configuration is a feature model that represents features and their dependencies (i.e., SPL configuration rules). This model can be extended by adding Non-Functional Properties (NFPs) as feature attributes resulting in Extended Feature Models (EFMs). Configuring products from an EFM requires considering the configuration rules of the model and satisfying the product functional and non-functional requirements. Although the configuration of a product arising from EFMs may reduce the space of valid configurations, selecting the most appropriate set of features is still an overwhelming task due to many factors including technical limitations and diversity of contexts. Consequently, configuring large and complex SPLs by using configurators is often beyond the users' capabilities of identifying valid combinations of features that match their (non-functional) requirements. To overcome this limitation, several approaches have modeled the product configuration task as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposed constraint programming algorithms to automatically derive a configuration. Although these approaches do not require any user intervention to guarantee the optimality of the generated configuration, due to the NP-hard computational complexity of finding an optimal variant, exact approaches have inefficient exponential time. Thus, to improve scalability and performance issues, we introduced the adoption of a greedy heuristic algorithm and a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). Our experiment results show that our proposed heuristics found optimal solutions for all instances where those are known. For the instances where optimal solutions are not known, the greedy heuristic outperformed the best solution obtained by a one-hour run of the exact algorithm by up to 67.89%. Although the BRKGA heuristic slightly outperformed the greedy heuristic, it has shown larger running times (especially on the largest instances). Therefore, to ensure a good user experience and enable a very fast configuration task, we extended a state-of-the-art configurator with the proposed greedy heuristic approach.},

abstract = {Quality assurance in general and testing in particular remains as an unsolved problem in product line engineering. It is unclear, from an economic point of view, whether one should test each product line member separately or test just product-specific parts and compose them with tested core assets from family engineering. While the former strategy introduces redundancy in testing, the latter strategy is also more difficult because of genericity. Ideally, we need to carefully calculate cost-benefits of both cases and define a test strategy accordingly. Currently, there is no economic model for testing in the context of product lines. Thus, we introduce an initial economic model, and then perform Monte-Carlo simulations to calculate cost-benefit of the two test strategies. For the Testo product line of climate and flue gas measurement devices, the results showed that, using an infrastructure-focused test strategy, on average a cost saving of 13% can be expected with 87% certainty.},

These are designed to demonstrate their approach but rarely to compare multiple approaches. In this paper, we aim at making variability modeling evaluations comparable. We present and provide a reusable set of four real-world case studies that are easy to access, with artifacts represented in a universal, variability-model-agnostic way, the industrial Product-Process-Resource Domain-Specific Language (PPR DSL). We report how researchers can use the case studies, automatically transforming the Domain-Specific Language (DSL) artifacts to well-known variability models, e.g., product feature models, using the Variability Evolution Roundtrip Transformation (VERT) process. We compare the expressiveness and complexity of the transformed feature models. We argue that the case studies with the DSL and the flexible transformation capabilities build a valuable contribution to making future research results more comparable and facilitating evaluations with real-world product lines.},

abstract = {The variability of a Software Product Line is usually both described in the problem space (by using a variability model) and in the solution space (i.e., the system implementation). If the two spaces are not aligned, wrong decisions can be done regarding the system configuration. In this work, we consider the case in which the variability model is not aligned with the solution space, and we propose an approach to automatically repair (possibly) faulty constraints in variability models. The approach takes as input a variability model and a set of combinations of features that trigger conformance faults between the model and the real system, and produces the repaired set of constraints as output. The approach consists of three major phases. First, it generates a test suite and identifies the condition triggering the faults. Then, it modifies the constraints of the variability model according to the type of faults. Lastly, it uses a logic minimization method to simplify the modified constraints. We evaluate the process on variability models of 7 applications of various sizes. An empirical analysis on these models shows that our approach can effectively repair constraints among features in an automated way.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) seamlessly becomes integrated into many aspects of daily life, and in the case of healthcare, it arises in the shape of eHealth IoT systems. Evidently, the design of such systems must apply best practices when it comes to security and privacy, in addition to ensuring compliance with various national and international regulations. When it comes to the required functionality, commonalities and variations can effectively be managed in a product line approach that involves deriving specific application architecture variants from a common reference architecture.This paper illustrates and discusses a specific problem encountered in the establishment of a software product-line in this specific context: the adoption of systematic security and privacy threat modeling and risk assessment approaches introduces a variation space that is very difficult to capture in a proactive product-line approach. One of the main causes for this is that threat assessment itself suffers from the problem of threat explosion, i.e. combinatorial explosions of threats that have to be investigated and systematically mitigated. The highlighted divergence of the security and privacy threats across architectural variants is illustrated in the specific case of an industry IoT-based e-health software product line.},

abstract = {Testing configurable systems is a challenging task due to the combinatorial explosion problem. Sampling is a promising approach to reduce the testing effort for product-based systems by finding a small but still representative subset (i.e., a sample) of all configurations for testing. The quality of a generated sample wrt. evaluation criteria such as run time of sample generation, feature coverage, sample size, and sampling stability depends on the subject systems and the sampling algorithm. Choosing the right sampling algorithm for practical applications is challenging because each sampling algorithm fulfills the evaluation criteria to a different degree. Researchers keep developing new sampling algorithms with improved performance or unique properties to satisfy application-specific requirements. Comparing sampling algorithms is therefore a necessary task for researchers. However, this task needs a lot of effort because of missing accessibility of existing algorithm implementations and benchmarks. Our platform AutoSMP eases practitioners and researchers lifes by automatically executing sampling algorithms on predefined benchmarks and evaluating the sampling results wrt. specific user requirements. In this paper, we introduce the open-source application of AutoSMP and a set of predefined benchmarks as well as a set of T-wise sampling algorithms as examples.},

abstract = {A Software Product Line (SPL) captures families of software products and its functionality is captured as features in a feature model. Similar to other software systems, SPLs and their feature models are subject to evolution. Temporal Feature Models (TFMs) are an extension to feature models that allow for engineers to model past feature-model evolution and plan future evolution. When planning future evolution of feature models, multiple evolution steps may be planned upfront but changed requirements may lead to retroactively introducing evolution steps into the planned evolution or changing already planned steps. As a consequence, inconsistencies, which we denote as evolution paradoxes, may arise leading to invalidity of already modeled future evolution steps. In this paper, we present first steps towards allowing to introduce intermediate evolution steps into planned evolution while preserving consistency of all future evolution steps. To this end, we outline a method to define and check model evolution consistency rules. Using this method, engineers are allowed to introduce intermediate feature-model evolution steps whenever these changes preserve the evolution consistency rules.},

abstract = {In Software Product Lines (SPL), feature extraction from software requirements specifications has been subject to intense research in order to assist domain analysis in a time-saving way. Although various approaches are proposed to extract features, there still exists a gap to achieve the complete view of features, that is, how to figure out the intention of a feature. Feature terms as the smallest units in a feature can be regarded as vital indicators for describing a feature. Automated feature term extraction can provide key information regarding the intention of a feature, which improves the efficiency of domain analysis. In this paper, we propose an approach to train prediction models by using machine learning techniques to identify feature terms. To this end, we extract candidate terms from requirement specifications in one domain and take six attributes of each term into account to create a labeled dataset. Subsequently, we apply seven commonly used machine algorithms to train prediction models on the labeled dataset. We then use these prediction models to predict feature terms from the requirements belonging to the other two different domains. Our results show that (1) feature terms can be predicted with high accuracy of ≈ 90% within a domain (2) prediction across domains leads to a decreased but still good accuracy (≈ 80%), and (3) machine learning algorithms perform differently.},

With the Bridge's innovative capabilities, you can achieve new levels of efficiency by utilizing: (1) Rhapsody MDD models, rather than working with conventional source code, and (2) Gears' SPL consolidation, first-class model variation points, and automated production capabilities -- rather than creating "clone-and-own" copies of MDD models for each product or building "one-size-fits-all" models for all products. This increased efficiency enables you to deliver more new products and features faster, while reducing the development effort and optimizing product quality.},

We present a solution for this challenge using a graph-based approach and set theory. The results are promising. Set theory allows to exactly define which parts of feature locations can be computed and which precision and which recall can be achieved.

abstract = {This article proposes an agile development method and its management method for multiple product lines of automotive software systems. In product line development, the problem area is divided into the domain engineering and application engineering for delivering diverse products. Now, the development of automotive software requires agility and extreme diversity. Conventional simple product line model could not accommodate the requirements. Therefore, we developed an agile development method for automotive multiple product lines. First, we propose an agile development method for multiple product lines by iteratively reusing process assets in application engineering. To manage the diversity of the products derived from the multiple product lines, we propose a management method which integrates the portfolio management and product development management into the agile development method. We applied the proposed method to the development of multiple product lines for our automotive software systems, and demonstrated a reduction of the cost and complexity of the multiple product lines, and improvement of on-time delivery.},

We have identified also some syntactic rules able to detect potential variability, such as disjunction between nouns or pairs of indicators in a subordinate proposition. This paper describes a new prototype NLP tool, based on the spaCy library, specifically designed to detect variability. The prototype is shown to preserve the same recall exhibited by previously used lexical tools, with a higher precision.},

abstract = {The proliferation of cyber-physical systems has encouraged the emergence of new technologies and paradigms to improve the performance of IoT-based applications. Edge Computing proposes using the nearby devices in the frontier/Edge of the access network for deploying application tasks. However, the functionality of cyberphysical systems, which is usually distributed in several devices and computers, imposes specific requirements on the infrastructure to run properly. The evolution of an application to meet new user requirements and the high diversity of hardware and software technologies in the edge can complicate the deployment of evolved applications.The aim of our approach is to apply Multi Layer Feature Models, which capture the variability of applications and the infrastructure, to support the deployment in edge-based environments of cyber-physical systems applications. This separation can support the evolution of application and infrastructure. Considering that IoT/Edge/Cloud infrastructures are usually shared by many applications, the SPL deployment process has to assure that there will be enough resources for all of them, informing developers about the alternatives of deployment. Prior to its deployment and leaning on the infrastructure feature models, the developer can calculate what is the configuration of minimal set of devices supporting application requirements of the evolved application. In addition, the developer can find which is the application configuration that can be hosted in the current evolved infrastructure.},

abstract = {A software product line is a family of software products that share a common set of mandatory features and whose individual products are differentiated by their variable (optional or alternative) features. Family-based analysis of software product lines takes as input a single model of a complete product line and analyzes all its products at the same time. As the number of products in a software product line may be large, this is generally preferable to analyzing each product on its own. Family-based analysis, however, requires that standard algorithms be adapted to accomodate variability.In this paper we adapt the standard algorithm for computing limit average cost of a weighted transition system to software product lines. Limit average is a useful and popular measure for the long-term average behavior of a quality attribute such as performance or energy consumption, but has hitherto not been available for family-based analysis of software product lines. Our algorithm operates on weighted featured transition systems, at a symbolic level, and computes limit average cost for all products in a software product line at the same time. We have implemented the algorithm and evaluated it on several examples.},

The functional requirements of the target product can be satisfied by including the proper functional features. However, there is no such a straightforward way to realize the non-functional requirements and quality attributes of the target product. In our early work, we have developed a quantitative based method to assess the quality attributes for a configured product. However, this approach cannot adequately represent the inter-relationships among quality attributes which play an important role in product configuration process. We supplement our previous work by introducing a quality attribute knowledge base (QA_KB) to represent the inter-relationships among different quality attributes in a SPL. Furthermore, we develop algorithms for configuring a product based on customers' quality requirements. We also use a case study to illustrate our approach.},

abstract = {Feature models are widely used for describing the variability of a software product line. A feature model contains a tree of features and a set of constraints over these features, which define valid feature combinations. In the industrial practice, large feature models containing hundreds of features and constraints are common. Furthermore, in a hierarchical product line a feature model can be related to other feature models through inter-model constraints. Due to the model size and complexity, understanding industrial feature models is a challenging task.In this paper, we describe the feature model understanding challenges reported by feature model developers at Robert Bosch GmbH. To support the developers in model understanding, we extend the idea of a feature implication graph to feature relation graph by abstracting groups of implications to feature relations. A transitively closed relation graph shows all modeled and implicit feature relations and spans all related feature models. The graph is also used to identify modeling problems, such as false optional or dead features, and to show the derivation of any implicit relation or problem from the modeled constraints. In a case study at Bosch, we evaluate the use of feature relation graph for model understanding. We propose further use cases of the graph, supporting model maintenance, evolution and configuration.},

abstract = {Context: Verification techniques such as model checking are being applied to ensure that software systems achieve desired quality levels and fulfill their functional and non-functional specification. However, applying these techniques to software product lines is a twofold challenge, given the exponential blowup of the number of products and the state-explosion problem inherent to model checking. Current product-line verification techniques leverage symbolic model checking and variability information to optimize the analysis but still face limitations that make them costly or infeasible. In particular, state-of-the-art verification techniques for product-line reliability analysis are enumerative which hinders their applicability, given the latent blowup of the configuration space.Objective: Our objectives are the following: (a) we present a method to efficiently compute the reliability of all configurations of a compositional or annotation-based software product line from its UML behavioral models, (b) we provide a tool that implements the proposed method, and (c) we report on an empirical study comparing the performance of different reliability analysis strategies for software product lines.Method: We present a novel feature-family-based analysis strategy to compute the reliability of all products of a (compositional or annotation-based) software product line. The strategy employs a divide-and-conquer approach over UML behavioral models endowed with probabilistic and variability information. The feature-based step of our strategy divides the behavioral models into smaller feature-dependent fragments that can be analyzed more efficiently. Such analysis consists of creating a probabilistic model for each behavioral fragment and analyzing such model using a parametric model checker that returns an expression denoting its reliability. Parameters in such expression represent the reliabilities of fragments on which it depends at runtime. The family-based step performs the reliability computation for all configurations at once (conquer) by evaluating reliability expressions in terms of a suitable variational data structure. This step solves the expression computed for each behavioral fragment taking into account (a) the fragment's variability information and (b) the reliability values already computed for the fragments on which it depends. The result is an Algebraic Decision Diagram (ADD) whose terminals different than zero represent the reliability value of valid (partial) configurations for the fragment. Therefore, the ADD computed for the last evaluated fragment contains the reliability values for all valid configurations of the software product line.Results: We performed an experiment to compare our feature-family-based and other four state-of-the-art evaluation strategies (product-based, family-based, feature-product-based and family-product-based). The subjects were variations of six publicly available product lines, whose configuration spaces were progressively increased. The empirical results show that our feature-family-based strategy outperforms, in terms of time and space, the other four state-of-the-art strategies. In addition, it is the only one that could be scaled to a 220-fold increase in the size of the configuration space.Conclusion: Our feature-family-based strategy leverages both feature-based and family-based strategies by taming the size of the models to be analyzed (due to the decomposition of behavioral models into fragments) and by avoiding the products enumeration inherent to some state-of-the-art analysis methods by using ADDs to represent both variability and reliability values.Journal paper: This paper was published at the Information and Software Technology Journal.

Feature models symbolize a representation of the possible application configuration space, and can be customized based on specific domain requirements and stakeholder goals. Most feature model configuration processes neglect the need to have a holistic approach towards the integration and satisfaction of the stakeholder's soft and hard constraints, and the application-domain integrity constraints. In this paper, we will show how the structure and constraints of a feature model can be modeled uniformly through Propositional Logic extended with concrete domains, called P(N). Furthermore, we formalize the representation of soft constraints in fuzzy P(N) and explain how semi-automated feature model configuration is performed. The model configuration derivation process that we propose respects the soundness and completeness properties.},

For instance, is the best run-time configuration always the best w.r.t. the chosen compilation options? In this paper, we investigate the effect of compile-time options on the performance distributions of 4 software systems. There are cases where the compiler layer effect is linear which is an opportunity to generalize performance models or to tune and measure runtime performance at lower cost. We also prove there can exist an interplay by exhibiting a case where compile-time options significantly alter the performance distributions of a configurable system.},

abstract = {The composition of the functionality of multiple services into a single unique service mashup has received wide interest in the recent years. Given the distributed nature of these mashups where the constituent services can be located on different servers, it is possible that a change in the functionality or availability of a constituent service result in the failure of the service mashup. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on the Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) paradigm which is able to find an alternate valid service mashup which has maximum possible number of original service mashup features in order to mitigate a service failure when complete recovery is not possible. This method also has an advantage that it can recover or mitigate the failure automatically without requiring the user to specify any adaptation rule or strategy. We show the practicality of our proposed approach through extensive experiments.},

abstract = {Requirements engineering is recognized as a critical stage in software development lifecycle. Given the nature of Software Product Lines (SPL), the importance of requirements engineering is more pronounced as SPLs pose more complex challenges than development of a 'single' product. Several methods have been proposed in the literature, which encompass activities for capturing requirements, their variability and commonality. To investigate the maturity and effectiveness of the current requirements engineering approaches in software product lines, we develop an evaluation framework containing a set of evaluation criteria and assess feature oriented requirements engineering methods based on the proposed criteria. As a result of this initial study, we find out the majority of approaches lacks proper techniques for supporting the validation of family requirements models as well as dealing with delta requirements. Additionally, capturing stakeholders' preferences and applying them during the course of software feature configuration have not been taken into account and addressed in the proposed approaches.},

abstract = {As a key activity in product line engineering (PLE), instantiation is a task to generate target applications by resolving variability embedded in core assets. However, instantiation is often conducted in manual and ad-hoc fashion, largely replying on domain knowledge and experience. Hence, it can easily lead to technical problems in precisely specifying decision model consisting of product-specific variation points and variants, and in handling inter-variant conflicts/dependency. To overcome this difficulty, it is desirable to develop a systematic process which includes a set of systematic activities, detailed instructions, and concrete specification of artifacts. In this paper, we first propose a meta-model of a core asset to specify its key elements. Then, we represent a comprehensive process that defines key instantiation activities, representations of artifacts, and work instructions. With the proposed process, one can instantiate core assets more effectively and systematically.},

abstract = {A number of SAT-based analysis concepts and tools for software product lines exist, that extract code dependencies in propositional logic from the source code assets of the product line. On these extracted conditions, SAT-solvers are used to reason about the variability. However, in practice, a lot of software product lines use integer-based variability. The variability variables hold integer values, and integer operators are used in the conditions. Most existing analysis tools can not handle this kind of variability; they expect pure Boolean conditions.This paper introduces an approach to convert integer-based variability conditions to propositional logic. Running this approach as a preparation on an integer-based product line allows the existing SAT-based analyses to work without any modifications. The pure Boolean formulas, that our approach builds as a replacement for the integer-based conditions, are mostly equivalent to the original conditions with respect to satisfiability. Our approach was motivated by and implemented in the context of a real-world industrial case-study, where such a preparation was necessary to analyze the variability.Our contribution is an approach to convert conditions, that use integer variables, into propositional formulas, to enable easy usage of SAT-solvers on the result. It works well on restricted variables (i.e. variables with a small range of allowed values); unrestricted integer variables are handled less exact, but still retain useful variability information.},

By analyzing this natural experiment, the product line team has been able to apply a methodical approach to product line adoption across the development organization and successfully adopt second generation product line processes. This paper explores that methodical approach. It will enumerate the steps that led to successes and explore the contributing factors and unintended consequences of failures along the way. Additionally this paper will explore how this approach is being employed to extend the LT2 product line beyond software.},

FeatureVista supports navigating between software components and features in an equal fashion. Our pilot study indicates that FeatureVista is intuitive and supports comprehending features. It helps to precisely characterize relations among features in large software systems and to contrast explicit software component definitions (e.g., package, class, method) with annotated feature portions---which so far was a largely manual and error-prone activity, albeit essential to get an adequate understanding of a software system. We suggest research directions for true, feature-oriented interfaces that can be used to manage software assets.},

publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},

abstract = {Most software product line cost estimation models are calibrated only to local product line data rather than to a broad range of product lines. They also underestimate the return on investment for product lines by focusing only on development vs. life-cycle savings, and by applying writing-for-reuse surcharges to the entire product rather that to the portions of the product being reused. This paper offers some insights based on the exploratory development and collaborative refinement of a software product line life cycle economics model, the Constructive Product Line Investment Model (COPLIMO) that addresses these shortfalls. COPLIMO consists of two components: a product line development cost model and an annualized post-development life cycle extension. It focuses on modeling the portions of the software that involve product-specific newly-built software, fully reused black-box product line components, and product line components that are reused with adaptation. This model is an extension built upon USC-CSE\'{y}s well-calibrated, multi-parameter Constructive Cost Model (COCOMO) II, tailored down to cover the essentials of strategic software product line decision issues and available supporting data from industries.},

This problem originates from the interchangeability for fulfilling functional and QoS concerns during composition. The approach utilizes the perspective of QoS to design and analyze a set of software systems represented by a collection of QoS systemic paths, which determine how well functional tasks perform in terms of flows of application-specific and functionality-determined information between components. Our approach not only reserves the virtues of reusability, changeability, productivity and expeditiousness that traditional CBSE and SPL technologies possess, but also dedicates the contributions in terms of separation of concerns, design space exploration, fine-grained commonality and reusability evaluation and less subjective feasibility analyses for a component-based SPL.},

abstract = {Feature models are the "de facto" standard for variability modelling and are used in both academia and industry. The MODEVAR initiative tries to establish a common textual feature modelling language that can be used by different communities and can allow information sharing. Feature model related researches use different models for different purposes such as analysis, sampling, testing, debugging, teaching, etc. Those models are shared in private repositories and there is a risk that all that knowledge is spread across different platforms which hinder collaboration and knowledge reuse. In this paper, we propose a first working version of a new feature model repository that allows to centralise the knowledge generated in the community together with advanced capabilities such as DOI generation, an API, analysis reports, among others. Our solution is a front end interface that uses the popular open science repository Zenodo as an end point to materialise the storage of all the information. Zenodo is enhanced with characteristics that facilitate the management of the models. The idea of our repository is to provide existing but also new features that are not present in other repositories (e.g., SPLOT). We propose to populate our repository with all the existing models of many sources including SPLOT.},

By adding an FQA (e.g., security) we can improve the quality of the final product, but there is also an increase in energy consumption. This paper proposes a solution to help the software architect to generate configurations of FQAs whilst keeping the energy consumed by the application as low as possible. For this, a usage model is defined for each FQA, taking into account the variables that affect the energy consumption, and that the values of these variables change according to the part of the application where the FQA is required. We extend a Software Product Line that models a family of FQAs to incorporate the variability of the usage model and the existing frameworks that implement FQAs. We generate the most eco-efficient configuration of FQAs by selecting the framework with the most suitable characteristics according to the requirements of the application.},

To deal with the automatic generation of custom-made configurations of web applications, industry usually adopts annotation-based approaches even though the majority of studies encourage the use of composition-based approaches to implement Software Product Lines. Recent work tries to combine both approaches to get the complementary benefits. However, technological companies are reticent to adopt new development paradigms such as feature-oriented programming or aspect-oriented programming. Moreover, it is extremely difficult, or even impossible, to apply these programming models to web applications, mainly because of their multilingual nature, since their development involves multiple types of source code (Java, Groovy, JavaScript), templates (HTML, Markdown, XML), style sheet files (CSS and its variants, such as SCSS), and other files (JSON, YML, shell scripts). We propose to use the Common Variability Language as a composition-based approach and integrate annotations to manage fine grained variability of a Software Product Line for web applications. In this paper, we (i) show that existing composition and annotation-based approaches, including some well-known combinations, are not appropriate to model and implement the variability of web applications; and (ii) present a combined approach that effectively integrates annotations into a composition-based approach for web applications. We implement our approach and show its applicability with an industrial real-world system.},

abstract = {The impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) on the modern industrial and commercial systems is hard to be underestimated. Almost every domain favours from the benefits that IoT brings, and healthcare does not make an exception. This is also clearly demonstrated by a widespread adoption of eHealth systems that often arise from software product lines. Nevertheless, the benefits that IoT brings come together with new threats and risks.An eHealth system that processes many types of sensitive data sets the context for this thesis. Security and privacy gain crucial importance for successful operation and broad user acceptance of the system because of the properties of the data flows that it initiates and operates. However, due to a large number of feature combinations that originate from the software product line nature of the eHealth system in question, a combinatorial explosion of relevant configurations makes reaching security and privacy goals more difficult. Furthermore, another combinatorial explosion of threats and corresponding mitigation strategies for every configuration complicates the situation even further. Nonetheless, configurations that meet specific risk budgets need to be in place.Within this thesis, a new threat and risk management (TRM) framework will be provided. It is based on STRIDE and LINDDUN methodologies, and it will overcome existing limitations by employing components on feature space modelling, risk-driven scoring, configuration decision support, and regulatory compliance. Research outcomes that have been reached so far show promising developments on the vital framework components.},

An example is the effort required to develop a product line architecture versus time-to-market pressure or the lack of evidence to justify the benefits of SPLE. In this report we discuss the tensions that exist in Oc\'{e} Technologies. A reactive software reuse approach has not yielded the desired long-term benefits of reusability. A proactive approach requires knowledge exchange and coordination between software management and technical staff.

abstract = {Product lines are a promising approach to improve conceptually the productivity of the software development process and thus to reduce both the cost and time of developing and maintaining increasingly complex systems. An important issue in the adoption of the product-line approach is the migration of legacy software components, which have not been designed for reuse, systematically into reusable product-line components. This article describes activities performed to improve systematically the design and implementation of an existing software component in order to reuse it in a software product line. The activities are embedded in the application of Fraunhofer PuLSE™-DSSA—an approach for defining domain-specific software architectures (DSSA) and product-line architectures. The component under investigation is the so-called Image Memory Handler (IMH), which is used in Ricoh's current products of office appliances such as copier machines, printers, and multi-functional peripherals. It is responsible for controlling memory usage and compressing and decompressing image data. Improvement of both the component's design and implementation are based on a systematic analysis and focused on increasing maintainability and reusability and hence suitability for use in a product line. As a result of the analysis and refactoring activities, the documentation and implementation of the component has been considerably improved as shown by quantitative data collected at the end of the activities. Despite a number of changes to the code, the external behavior of the component has been preserved without significantly affecting the performance. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

Unfortunately, practitioners in industry still develop custom solutions to manage variability of various artifacts, like requirements documents or design spreadsheets. These custom-developed variability representations often miss important variability information, e.g., information required to assemble production goods. In this paper, we introduce the Variability Evolution Roundtrip Transformation (VERT) process. The process enables practitioners from the Cyber-Physical Production Systems domain to transform custom-developed engineering variability artifacts to a feature model, evolve and optimize the model, and transform it back to the original engineering artifacts. We build on an existing transformation approach for variability models and show the feasibility of the process using a real-world use case from an industry partner. We report on an initial feasibility study conducted with our industry partners' domain experts and on lessons learned regarding variability transformation of engineering variability artifacts.},

abstract = {This PhD project aims to automatically learn transition systems capturing the behaviour of a whole family of software-based systems. Reasoning at the family level yields important economies of scale and quality improvements for a broad range of systems such as software product lines, adaptive and configurable systems. Yet, to fully benefit from the above advantages, a model of the system family's behaviour is necessary. Such a model is often prohibitively expensive to create manually due to the number of variants. For large long-lived systems with outdated specifications or for systems that continuously adapt, the modelling cost is even higher. Therefore, this PhD proposes to automate the learning of such models from existing artefacts. To advance research at a fundamental level, our learning target are Featured Transition Systems (FTS), an abstract formalism that can be used to provide a pivot semantics to a range of variability-aware state-based modelling languages. The main research questions addressed by this PhD project are: (1) Can we learn variability-aware models efficiently? (2) Can we learn FTS in a black-box fashion? (i.e., with access to execution logs but not to source code); (3) Can we learn FTS in a white/grey-box testing fashion? (i.e., with access to source code); and (4) How do the proposed techniques scale in practice?},

abstract = {Control software for automated production systems (aPs) becomes increasingly complex as it evolves due to changing requirements. To address varying customer demands or altered regulatory guidelines, it is common practice to create a new system variant by copying and subsequently modifying existing control software. Referred to as clone-and-own, proper documentation is typically not cherished, thereby entailing severe maintenance issues in the long-run. To mitigate such problems and to reinstate sustainable development, respective software systems need to be compared and their variability information needs to be reverse-engineered. However, recent work identified variability management in the domain of aPs to remain a challenging endevour and appropriate tool support to be missing.We bridge this gap and introduce the Variability Analysis Toolkit (VAT), an extensible platform that allows for the customizable definition of metrics to compare IEC61131-3 control software variants as well as providing means to visualize results. The VAT facilitates a working environment that allows for the exchange of produced results between users. By that, we aim to support engineers in re-engineering control software systems by providing them with means to define metrics based on their individual demands. We demonstrate the feasibility of the VAT using 24 software system variants implemented in accordance to the IEC61131-3 standard.},

In this paper, we address the problem of variability in software product lines testing. We (1) identify a set of issues that must be addressed to make software product line testing work in practice and (2) provide a framework that combines a set of techniques to solve these issues. The framework integrates feature modelling, combinatorial interaction testing and constraint programming techniques. First, we extract variability in a software product line as a feature model with specified feature interdependencies. We then employ an algorithm that generates a minimal set of valid test cases covering all 2-way feature interactions for a given time interval. Furthermore, we evaluate the framework on an industrial SPL and show that using the framework saves time and provides better test coverage. In particular, our experiments show that the framework improves industrial testing practice in terms of (i) 17% smaller set of test cases that are (a) valid and (b) guarantee all 2-way feature coverage (as opposite to 19.2% 2-way feature coverage in the hand made test set), and (ii) full flexibility and adjustment of test generation to available testing time.},

abstract = {Variation is central to today's software development. There are two fundamental dimensions to variation: Variation in time refers to the fact that software exists in numerous revisions that typically replace each other (i.e., a newer version supersedes an older one). Variation in space refers to differences among variants that are designed to coexist in parallel. There are numerous analyses to cope with variation in space (i.e., product-line analyses) and others that cope with variation in time (i.e., regression analyses). The goal of this work is to discuss to which extent product-line analyses can be applied to revisions and, conversely, where regression analyses can be applied to variants. In addition, we discuss challenges related to the combination of product-line and regression analyses. The overall goal is to increase the efficiency of analyses by exploiting the inherent commonality between variants and revisions.},

abstract = {Feature and variability extraction from different artifacts is an indispensable activity to support systematic integration of single software systems and Software Product Line (SPL). Beyond manually extracting variability, a variety of approaches, such as feature location in source code and feature extraction in requirements, has been proposed to provide an automatic identification of features and their variation points. Compared with source code, requirements contain more complete variability information and provide traceability links to other artifacts from early development phases. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically extract features and relationships based on a probabilistic relevance and word embedding. In particular, our technique consists of three steps: First, we apply word2vec to obtain a prediction model, which we use to determine the word level similarity of requirements. Second, based on word level similarity and the significance of a word in a domain, we compute the requirements level similarity using probabilistic relevance. Third, we adopt hierarchical clustering to group features and we define four criteria to detect variation points between identified features. We perform a case study to evaluate the usability and robustness of our method and to compare it with the results of other related approaches. Initial results reveal that our approach identifies the majority of features correctly and also extracts variability information with reasonable accuracy.},

abstract = {It is not unusual for commercial product line organizations to manufacture millions of product instances every year, in thousands of different "flavors". The scale and scope of diversity in product lines of this size can be high, creating significant challenges to engineers implementing the product line, product marketers defining the space of available products, and customers selecting from available products. Companies often organize their products into a product family tree to provide clarity about their product groupings and offerings, better enabling their customers to effectively navigate among the huge number of offerings and to efficiently converge on a suitable product instance. This paper describes a 2nd Generation Product Line Engineering (2GPLE) feature modeling structure called a multistage configuration tree that supports the engineering, deployment and maintenance of complex product family trees. Feature selections and downselections are incrementally staged throughout the nodes in a product family tree. Feature decisions made at any node are inherited by all descendants of that node, thereby defining a product family subtree.},

The proposed approach mainly addresses “Reflective Aspect” and “Reflective Rule” patterns for the seamless integration of Aurora and RUMBA. Both architectural patterns introduce a “generative” approach for developing the basic aspects, dynamic rules and rule-sets so that all can be implemented in the Adaptive Object Model (AOM). The proposed model will be explained in detail and exemplified with existing projects using both Aurora and RUMBA approaches.},

abstract = {Within software product lines, customers may have different quality needs. To produce products with purposefully different quality attributes, several challenges must be addressed. First, one must be able to distinguish product quality attributes to the customers in a meaningful way. Second, one must create the desired quality attribute differences during product-line architecture design and derivation. To study how performance is varied purposefully in software product lines, we conducted a comparison and re-analysis of two industrial case studies in the telecommunication and mobile game domains. The results show that performance variants must be communicated to the customer in a way that links to customer value and her role. When performance or its adaptation are crucial for the customer, performance differences must be explicitly "designed in" with software or hardware means. Due to the emergent nature of performance, it is important to test performance and manage how other variability affects performance.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a promising paradigm for reusing knowledge and artifacts among similar software products. However, SPLE methods and techniques require a high up-front investment and hence are profitable if several similar software products are developed. Thus in practice adoption of SPLE commonly takes a bottom-up approach, in which analyzing the commonality and variability of existing products and transforming them into reusable ones (termed core assets) are needed. These time-consuming and error-prone tasks call for automation. The literature partially deals with solutions for early software development stages, mainly in the form of variability analysis. We aim for further creation of core requirements—reusable requirements that can be adapted for different software products. To this end, we introduce an automated extractive method, named CoreReq, to generate core requirements from product requirements written in a natural language. The approach clusters similar requirements, captures variable parts utilizing natural language processing techniques, and generates core requirements following an ontological variability framework. Focusing on cloning scenarios, we evaluated CoreReq through examples and a controlled experiment. Based on the results, we claim that core requirements generation with CoreReq is feasible and usable for specifying requirements of new similar products in cloning scenarios.},

abstract = {As Software Product Lines (SPLs) are now more widely applied in new application fields such as IT or Web systems, complex and large-scale configurations have to be handled. In these fields, the strong domain orientation leads to the need to manage interrelated SPLs and multiple instances of configured sub-products, resulting in complex configurations that cannot be easily represented by simple sets of features. In this paper we propose a tooled approach to manage such SPLs through a domain model that interrelates several feature models in a consistent way. The approach thus shifts part of the domain knowledge to the problem space and supports the derivation of complex configurations with multiple instantiations and associations of sub-products. We also report on the application of our approach to an industrial-strength software development in the field of digital signage.},

year = {2005},
isbn = {9780542672545},
publisher = {Vanderbilt University},
address = {USA},
abstract = {Product-line architectures (PLA)s are an emerging paradigm for developing software families by customizing reusable artifacts, rather than hand-crafting the software from scratch. In this paradigm, each product variant is assembled, configured, and deployed based on specifications of the required features and service-level agreements. To reduce the effort of developing software PLAs and product variants, it is common to leverage general-purpose---ideally standard---middleware platforms. These middleware platforms provide reusable services and mechanisms (such as connection management, data transfer protocols, concurrency control, demultiplexing, marshaling/demarshaling, and error-handling) that support a broad range of application requirements (such as efficiency, predictability, and minimizing end-to-end latency). A key challenge faced by developers of software PLAs is how to optimize standards-based---and thus largely application-independent---middleware to support the application-specific quality of service (QoS) needs of different product variants created atop a PLA. This dissertation provides four contributions to research on optimizing middleware for PLAs. First, it describes the evolution of optimization techniques for enhancing application-independent middleware to support the application-specific QoS needs of PLAs. Second, it presents a taxonomy that categorizes the evolution of this research in terms of (1)&nbsp;applicability, i.e., are the optimizations applicable across variants or specific to a variant, and (2)&nbsp;binding time, i.e., when are the optimizations applied during the middleware development lifecycle. Third, this taxonomy is applied to identify key challenges that have not been resolved by current research on PLAs, including reducing the complexity of subsetting, configuring, and specializing middleware for PLAs to satisfy the QoS requirements of product variants. Finally, the dissertation describes the OPTEML solution approach that synergistically addresses key unresolved research challenges via optimization strategies that encompass pattern-oriented, model-driven development, and specialization techniques to enhance the QoS and flexibility of middleware for PLAs. These optimizations have been prototyped, integrated, and validated in the context of several representative applications using middleware developed with Real-time Java and C++.},

abstract = {Planning and developing Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS) are multi-disciplinary engineering activities that rely on effective and efficient knowledge exchange for better collaboration between engineers of different disciplines. The Product-Process-Resource (PPR) approach allows modeling products produced by industrial processes using specific production resources. In practice, a CPPS manufactures a portfolio of product type variants, i.e., a product line. Therefore, engineers need to create and maintain several PPR models to cover PPR variants and their evolving versions. In this paper, we detail a representative use case, identify challenges for using Variability Modeling (VM) methods to describe and manage PPR variants, and present a first solution approach based on cooperation with domain experts at an industry partner, a system integrator of automation for high-performance CPPS. We conclude that integrating basic variability concepts into PPR models is a promising first step and describe our further research plans to support PPR VM in CPPS.},

There exist analyses alternatives such as SAT solving or constraint programming. However, none of them have explored simulation-based methods. Monte Carlo-based decision making is a simulation-based method for dealing with colossal solution spaces using randomness. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that tackles various of those analyses using Monte Carlo methods, which have proven to succeed in vast search spaces (e.g., game theory). Our general framework is described formally, and its flexibility to cope with a diversity of analysis problems is discussed (e.g., finding defective configurations, feature model reverse engineering or getting optimal performance configurations). Additionally, we present a Python implementation of the framework that shows the feasibility of our proposal. With this contribution, we envision that different problems can be addressed using Monte Carlo simulations and that our framework can be used to advance the state of the art a step forward.},

abstract = {Software and System Product Lines (SSPL) are the state-of-the-art for systematically reusing a common set of core assets in the development of similar products in a product family. A large number of SSPL success stories have been published in the last decade and commercial tool support is also available. SSPLs promise to reduce cost, to shorten time-to-market for new features, and to increase product quality by systematically reusing core assets in the development of three or more systems. However, an open challenge is SSPL engineering for safety-relevant systems such as automotive, avionic, or industrial automation systems. Safety-relevant systems have to be developed, analyzed, and certified according to safety standards such as IEC 61508. These standards demand the application of safety analyses such as Fault Tree Analysis and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis. Starting the safety analysis of each product variant of a SSPL from scratch is complex and very time-consuming. However, there are only few convincing cases, where SSPL approaches have been followed in safety engineering. To pave the way for a broader adoption of SSPL approaches, this paper reports practical experiences with industrial-strength methods and tools along an adaptive cruise control SSPL. The paper demonstrates how commercial tools can be used (i) to analyze safety-related aspects already in the architectural design, (ii) to model the results as component integrated component fault trees (C2FT), and (iii) to systematically reuse C2FT in the safety analysis of a concrete product. The results of the case study show that C2FT (i) can be easily integrated into a feature-oriented development process of SSPL, (ii) facilitate early consideration of safety in domain engineering, and (iii) reduce effort and complexity of safety analyses in application engineering.},

abstract = {The evolution of variant-rich systems is a challenging task. To support developers, the research community has proposed a range of different techniques over the last decades. However, many techniques have not been adopted in practice so far. To advance such techniques and to support their adoption, it is crucial to evaluate them against realistic baselines, ideally in the form of generally accessible benchmarks. To this end, we need to improve our empirical understanding of typical evolution scenarios for variant-rich systems and their relevance for benchmarking. In this paper, we establish eleven evolution scenarios in which benchmarks would be beneficial. Our scenarios cover typical lifecycles of variant-rich system, ranging from clone &amp; own to adopting and evolving a configurable product-line platform. For each scenario, we formulate benchmarking requirements and assess its clarity and relevance via a survey with experts in variant-rich systems and software evolution. We also surveyed the existing benchmarking landscape, identifying synergies and gaps. We observed that most scenarios, despite being perceived as important by experts, are only partially or not at all supported by existing benchmarks-a call to arms for building community benchmarks upon our requirements. We hope that our work raises awareness for benchmarking as a means to advance techniques for evolving variant-rich systems, and that it will lead to a benchmarking initiative in our community.},

The identification of key stakeholders should ensure that the most relevant requirements are elicited during a software planning cycle.The objective of this research is to examine how key stakeholders can be identified in complex SECOs. This research takes a design science approach and the main component of the current research is the design of an artifact in the form of a reference process model, that is applied in a real-world environment to develop a business process model. Consequently, this research aims to facilitate academia and industry in SECO optimization, especially from a requirements management perspective.},

abstract = {Software product family or line is a software engineering paradigm that systematizes reuse. In Software Product Line Engineering, two phases are distinguished: Domain Engineering which is in charge of developing a common infrastructure and assets and Application Engineering which makes use of those assets to generate the products. One of the key aspects of product lines is variability and its management. However, the main focus has been on functional variability and quality variability in software product lines has not received so much attention by researchers. In a product line different members of the line may require different levels of a quality requirement, for instance they could differ in terms of their availability, security, reliability, etc. Due to this variability, quality evaluation in software product lines is much more complicated that in single-systems. One alternative is to evaluate all the products of a line but it is very expensive and ways of reducing evaluation efforts are necessary. In this direction, the paper presents a method for facilitating cost-effective quality evaluation of a product line taking into consideration variability on quality attributes.},

abstract = {Systems are typically not developed from scratch, so different kinds of similarities between them exist, challenging their maintenance and future development. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) proposes methods and techniques for developing reusable artifacts that can be systematically reused in similar systems. Despite the potential benefits of SPLE to decrease time-to-market and increase product quality, it requires a high up-front investment and hence SPLE techniques are commonly adopted in a bottom-up approach, after individual systems have already been developed. Deciding whether to turn existing systems into a product line – referred to as product line-ability – involves many aspects and requires some tooling for analyzing similarities and differences among systems. In this paper we propose a framework for the identification of “similarly behaving” artifacts and analyzing their potential reuse in the context of product lines. This framework provides metrics for calculating behavior similarity and a method for analyzing the product line-ability of a set of products. The framework has been integrated into a tool named VarMeR – Variability Mechanisms Recommender, whose aim is to systematically guide reuse.},

abstract = {Real-time requirements are crucial for embedded software in many modern application domains of software product lines. Hence, techniques for modeling and analyzing time-critical software have to be lifted to software product line engineering, too. Existing approaches extend timed automata (TA) by feature constraints to so-called featured timed automata (FTA) facilitating efficient verification of real-time properties for entire product lines in a single run. In this paper, we propose a novel modeling formalism, called configurable parametric timed automata (CoPTA), extending expressiveness of FTA by supporting freely configurable and therefore a-priori unbounded timing intervals for real-time constraints, which are defined as feature attributes in extended feature models with potentially infinite configuration spaces. We further describe an efficient test-suite generation methodology for CoPTA models, achieving location coverage on every possible model configuration. Finally, we present evaluation results gained from applying our tool implementation to a collection of case studies, demonstrating efficiency improvements compared to a variant-by-variant analysis.},

Feature models are widely used to encode the common and variant parts of an SPL. The number of products encoded in a feature model grows with the number of features. Given n features and no constraints on valid feature combinations, there are 2n possible products. To deal with this complexity, automated mechanisms are used to extract information from feature models, such as features present in every product. A diversity of operations have been developed to model check, test, configure, debug, or compute relevant information by analyzing feature models. Moreover, such operations have been used in scenarios from different domains ranging from operating systems to video analysis optimization. In this tutorial, we go through the different automated analysis operations identifying its usage in the literature. Later present how to implement these operations within the FaMa framework.},

abstract = {Exploring architectural design space is often beyond human capacity and makes architectural design a difficult task. Model-based systems engineering must include assistance to the system designer in identifying candidate architectures to subsequently analyze tradeoffs. Unfortunately, existing languages and approaches do not incorporate this concern, generally favoring solution analysis over exploring a set of candidate architectures.In this paper, we explore the advantages of designing and configuring the variability problem to solve one of the problems of exploring (synthesizing) candidate architectures in systems engineering: the resource allocation problem. More specifically, this work reports on the use of the Clafer modeling language and its gateway to the CSP Choco Solver, on an industrial case study of heterogeneous hardware resource allocation (GPP-GPGPU-FPGA).Based on experiments on the modeling in Clafer, and the impact of its translation into the constraint programming paradigm (performance studies), discussions highlight some issues concerning facilities for modeling and synthesis of architectures and recommendations are proposed towards the use of this variability approach.},

abstract = {The term bug prevalence is derived from the medical world vocabulary and applied to Software Product Line (SPL), meaning all products that are affected by one particular bug. In single systems development, this concept is not relevant since a bug is either present or not. However, when it comes to SPL, analyzing the bug prevalence of a certain bug is still a challenge and a highly relevant topic, since the same bug may be present in several products. To support this analysis, the main contribution of this paper is the Product Genealogy approach. A core concept in our approach is the Product Genealogy Tree, in which the hierarchy of products in the SPL is represented, reflecting how each product evolved or was derived from another or from the core assets. In this context, the benefit of such a tree is the rapid visualization of the product's structure in the SPL, providing input on which products are to be examined initially. Besides that, in this paper we introduce a novel analogy between the medical genetics world and SPL in order to better explain the principles of our approach.},

abstract = {Feature models are widely used to encode the configurations of a software product line in terms of mandatory, optional and exclusive features as well as propositional constraints over the features. Numerous computationally expensive procedures have been developed to model check, test, configure, debug, or compute relevant information of feature models. In this paper we explore the possible improvement of relying on the enumeration of all configurations when performing automated analysis operations. We tackle the challenge of how to scale the existing enumeration techniques by relying on distributed computing. We show that the use of distributed computing techniques might offer practical solutions to previously unsolvable problems and opens new perspectives for the automated analysis of software product lines.},

abstract = {A common software product line strategy involves plugin-based web systems that support simple and quick incorporation of custom behaviors. As a result, they have been widely adopted to create web-based applications. Indeed, the popularity of ecosystems that support plugin-based development (e.g., WordPress) is largely due to the number of customization options available as community-contributed plugins. However, plugin-related vulnerabilities tend to be recurrent, exploitable and hard to be detected and may lead to severe consequences for the customized product. Hence, there is a need to further understand such vulnerabilities to enable preventing relevant security threats. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study to characterize vulnerabilities caused by plugins in web-based systems. To this end, we went over WordPress vulnerability bulletins cataloged by the National Vulnerability Database as well as associated patches maintained by the WordPress plugins repository. We identified the main types of vulnerabilities caused by plugins as well as their impact and the size of the patch to fix the vulnerability. Moreover, we identified the most common security-related topics discussed among WordPress developers. We observed that, while plugin-related vulnerabilities may have severe consequences and might remain unnoticed for years before being fixed, they can commonly be mitigated with small and localized changes to the source code. The characterization helps to provide an understanding on how typical plugin-based vulnerabilities manifest themselves in practice. Such information can be helpful to steer future research on plugin-based vulnerability detection and prevention.},

abstract = {In a Software Product Line (SPL), the central notion of implementability provides the requisite connection between specifications (feature sets) and their implementations (component sets), leading to the definition of products. While it appears to be a simple extension (to sets) of the trace-ability relation between components and features, it actually involves several subtle issues which are overlooked in the definitions in existing literature. In this paper, we give a precise and formal definition of implementability over a fairly expressive traceability relation to solve these issues. The consequent definition of products in the given SPL naturally entails a set of useful analysis problems that are either refinements of known problems, or are completely novel. We also propose a new approach to solve these analysis problems by encoding them as Quantified Boolean Formula(QBF) and solving them through Quantified Satisfiability (QSAT) solvers. The methodology scales much better than the SAT-based solutions hinted in the literature and is demonstrated through a prototype tool called SPLANE (SPL Analysis Engine), on a couple of fairly large case studies.},

abstract = {Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Software Product Lines (SPL) have individually proven to be software engineering concepts that create added value to the development of software systems. Recently, the research community has recognized and investigated potentials for combining these two concepts. However, there have been no mapping study and literature surveys that systematically review the present research results in combining the two. This paper presents results of a preliminary work on a systematic mapping study of research papers that report on combining SOA and SPL. The main goal of a systematic mapping study is to provide a breath overview, classification of approaches and the quantity and type of research as well as available research results, which is complimentary step toward further systematic literature review. This paper, based on selected papers published from 2002 to mid-2010, reports on various aspects of the analyzed literature, including the motivations for combining the two concepts; contributions to specific stages of software engineering lifecycles; types of synergies and characteristics that are accomplished through combinations of the two concepts; and the methods used for and the rigor of the evaluations of the research conducted on the studied topic.},

abstract = {Vulnerabilities in software systems result from faults, which occur at different stages in a software's life cycle, for example, in the design (i.e., undesired feature-interactions), the development (i.e., buffer overflows), or the operation (i.e., configuration errors). Various databases provide detailed information about vulnerabilities in software systems or the way to exploit it, but face severe limitations. The information is scattered across these databases, fluctuates in quality and granularity, and provides only an insight into a single vulnerability per entry. Even for a single software system it is challenging for any security-related stakeholder to determine the threat level, which consists of all vulnerabilities of the software system and its environment (i.e., operating system). Manual vulnerability management is feasible only to a limited extend if we want to identify all configurations that are affected by vulnerabilities, or determine a system's threat level and the resulting risk we have to deal with. For variant-rich systems, we also have to deal with variability, allowing different stakeholders to understand the threats to their particular setup. To deal with this variability, we propose vulnerability feature models, which offer a homogeneous view on all vulnerabilities of a software system. These models and the resulting analyses offer advantages in many disciplines of the vulnerability management process. In this paper, we report the research plan for our project, in which we focus on the model-based evaluation of vulnerabilities. This includes research objectives that take into account the design of vulnerability feature models, their application in the process of vulnerability management, and the impact of evolution, discovery, and verification of vulnerabilities.},

Many techniques have been proposed to deal with this increasing complexity, mostly in the field of model-based development which abstracts the architects and designers from the architectural and technological complexities. However, these techniques do not take into account the great variability of these architectures, and therefore limit the architectural options available for their users. We here describe a feature model that captures the architectural and technological variability of multilayer applications. Using this feature model as the core of a model-driven development process, we are able to incorporate architectural and technological variability into the model-based development of multilayer applications. This approach keeps complexity under control whilst flexibility on choosing technologies is not penalized},

We identified two popular modeling paradigms: Feature-oriented domain modeling (FODM) and domain specific modeling (DSM). The appropriate choice of the modeling paradigm is a crucial decision for the development of an efficient and easy to use domain model. For complex and heterogeneous domain descriptions, for example embedded system descriptions, different representation techniques can be useful to describe the different parts of the system. We propose a method to combine both representation techniques to realize a domain specific multi modeling approach. This supports not only a more natural domain description, but can as well be seen as a support for knowledge transfer between different stakeholders.},

Despite their unquestionable value, industrial projects inherently pose limitations; for instance, in terms of open access or results replication, which are two important tenets for any scientific endeavor.

abstract = {The cell-to-cell variability of batteries is a well-known problem particularly when it comes to the assembly of large battery packs. Different battery cells exhibit substantial variability due to manufacturing tolerances, which should be assessed and managed carefully. Such variability has been approached mostly from the point of view of the chemical and physical phenomena, but these solutions are normally too complicated for the system-level design of electric applications. This paper proposes a combined cell-to-cell variability model of the capacity and internal resistance of a Li-ion battery that accounts for the variability effects in the cell manufacturing process. The proposed model allows to verify some known properties, such as the correlation between the capacity and internal resistance, to be verified qualitatively and the amount of variability and its impact on the design of battery packs to be assessed quantitatively. Using this model, the issue of how to consider the variability when constructing battery packs was also addressed. Modern battery packs normally incorporate some cell balancing circuitry, which is meant to balance cell voltages during charging at the expense of a bypassed (unstored) charge. For discharge, the cell-to-cell variability hides a part of the usable capacity of the battery pack. This paper proposes the use of variability information to assemble battery packs with minimal intracolumn variance of capacity. A weight-based variance minimization method, based on the correlation between cell capacity and weight is proposed to avoid resorting to direct battery capacity measurements, which is time-consuming and requires costly measurement equipment. The simulation result shows that the proposed weight-based approach allows an acceptable management of the cell-to-cell variability without the discharging experiment.},

abstract = {Eclipse OMR is an open-source C++ framework for building robust language runtimes. The OMR toolkit includes a dynamic Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, a garbage collector, a platform abstraction library, and a set of developer tooling capabilities. To support the diverse languages and architectures targeted by the framework, OMR's variability implementation uses a combination of build-system variability and static polymorphism. That is, all implementation classes that depend on the selected language and architecture are decided at compile time. However, OMR developers now realize that the current variability design decision, specifically the static polymorphism implementation, has its drawbacks. They are considering using dynamic polymorphism instead of static polymorphism. Before making such a fundamental design change, however, it is crucial to collect function information and overload/override statistics about the current variability in the code base.In this paper, we present OMRStatistics, a static analysis tool that we built for OMR developers to help them collect this information. Specifically, OMRStatistics (1) visualizes the class hierarchy from OMR's current static polymorphic implementation, (2) visualizes the function overloads and overrides with their respective locations in the source code, (3) collects important information about the classes and functions, and (4) stores all the collected information in a database for further analysis. Our tool OMRStatistics allows OMR developers to make better design decisions on which variability extension points should be switched from static polymorphism to dynamic polymorphism.},

abstract = {Quality assurance for product lines is often infeasible for each product separately. Instead, only a subset of all products (i.e., a sample) is considered during testing such that at least the coverage of certain feature interactions is guaranteed. While pair-wise interaction sampling only covers all interactions between two features, its generalization to t-wise interaction sampling ensures coverage for all interactions among t features. However, sampling large product lines poses a challenge, as today's algorithms tend to run out of memory, do not terminate, or produce samples, which are too large to be tested. To initiate a community effort, we provide a set of large real-world feature models with up-to 19 thousand features, which are supposed to be sampled. The performance of sampling approaches is evaluated based on the CPU time and memory consumed to retrieve a sample, the sample size for a given coverage (i.e. the value of t) and whether the sample achieves full t-wise coverage. A well-performing sampling algorithm achieves full t-wise coverage, while minimizing the other properties as best as possible.},

abstract = {Incremental satisfiability (SAT) solving is an extension of classic SAT solving that allows users to efficiently solve a set of related SAT problems by identifying and exploiting shared terms. However, using incremental solvers effectively is hard since performance is sensitive to a problem's structure and the order sub-terms are fed to the solver, and the burden to track results is placed on the end user. For analyses that generate sets of related SAT problems, such as those in software product lines, incremental SAT solvers are either not used at all, used but not explicitly stated so in the literature, or used but suffer from the aforementioned usability problems. This paper translates the ordering problem to an encoding problem and automates the use of incremental SAT solving. We introduce variational SAT solving, which differs from incremental SAT solving by accepting all related problems as a single variational input and returning all results as a single variational output. Our central idea is to make explicit the operations of incremental SAT solving, thereby encoding differences between related SAT problems as local points of variation. Our approach automates the interaction with the incremental solver and enables methods to automatically optimize sharing of the input. To evaluate our methods we construct a prototype variational SAT solver and perform an empirical analysis on two real-world datasets that applied incremental solvers to software evolution scenarios. We show, assuming a variational input, that the prototype solver scales better for these problems than naive incremental solving while also removing the need to track individual results.},

To this end, we view CNNs as configurable systems and propose an end-to-end framework that allows the configuration, evaluation and automated search for CNN architectures. Therefore, our contribution is threefold. First, we model the variability of CNN architectures with a Feature Model (FM) that generalizes over existing architectures. Each valid configuration of the FM corresponds to a valid CNN model that can be built and trained. Second, we implement, on top of Tensorflow, an automated procedure to deploy, train and evaluate the performance of a configured model. Third, we propose a method to search for configurations and demonstrate that it leads to good CNN models. We evaluate our method by applying it on image classification tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10) and show that, with limited amount of computation and training, our method can identify high-performing architectures (with high accuracy). We also demonstrate that we outperform existing state-of-the-art architectures handcrafted by ML researchers. Our FM and framework have been released to support replication and future research.},

In such situations companies have used different domain analysis approaches (e.g., SEI Technical Probe) that helped to assess technical and organizational potential for a software product line approach. We applied existing domain analysis approaches for software product line engineering and tailored them to include a feature analysis as well as architecture evaluation. In this paper, we report our experiences from applying the approach in two subdomains of industrial automation.},

T-wise sampling is one method of finding a representative subset of configurations for a system, which can then be tested. However, for large-scale systems, such as Linux, existing t-wise sampling algorithms do not scale well. To this end, Pett et al. proposed the sampling challenge for large-scale systems at SPLC 2019.

abstract = {In a software product line similar products are derived based on a common foundation. With traditional methods a number of similar products exist independently. To derive a maintainable, reusable set of software components it is necessary to understand similarities and differences. However, an adequate similarity analysis involving several products is a cost-intensive and difficult task, compromising the pursued benefit. In this paper an automated syntactical similarity analysis for software component interfaces is proposed to support the software product line extraction and maintenance. We apply this general approach specifically to the automotive domain, as the static nature of the architecture and the high number of well-defined signals makes the interfaces especially expressive. The analysis supports three use cases: the identification of similarities between two interfaces, the automated extraction of a common interface for a set of interfaces and the evaluation of interface changes during the evolution history of a software component. In addition the syntactical analysis provides the foundation for further semantical examinations. Its applicability is indicated by a case study on different variants and versions of interfaces defined in an industrial context.},

abstract = {Product-line architectures (PLAs) are an emerging paradigm for developing software families for distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems by customizing reusable artifacts, rather than hand-crafting software from scratch. To reduce the effort of developing software PLAs and product variants for DRE systems, developers are applying general-purpose -- ideally standard -- middleware platforms whose reusable services and mechanisms support a range of application quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as low latency and jitter. The generality and flexibility of standard middleware, however, often results in excessive time/space overhead for DRE systems, due to lack of optimizations tailored to meet the specific QoS requirements of different product variants in a PLA.This paper provides the following contributions to the study of middleware specialization techniques for PLA-based DRE systems. First, we identify key dimensions of generality in standard middleware stemming from framework implementations, deployment platforms, and middleware standards. Second, we illustrate how context-specific specialization techniques can be automated and used to tailor standard middleware to better meet the QoS needs of different PLA product variants. Third, we quantify the benefits of applying automated tools to specialize a standard Realtime CORBA middleware implementation. When applied together, these middleware specializations improved our application product variant throughput by ~65%, average- and worst-case end-to-end latency measures by ~43% and ~45%, respectively, and predictability by a factor of two over an already optimized middleware implementation, with little or no effect on portability, standard middleware APIs, or application software implementations, and interoperability.},

abstract = {Software is often released in multiple variants to address the needs of different customers or application scenarios. One frequent approach to create new variants is clone-and-own, whose systematic support has gained considerable research interest in the last decade. However, only few techniques have been evaluated in a realistic setting, due to a substantial lack of publicly available clone-and-own projects which could be used as experimental subjects. Instead, many studies use variants generated from software product lines for their evaluation. Unfortunately, the results might be biased, because variants generated from a single code base lack unintentional divergences that would have been introduced by clone-and-own. In this paper, we report about ongoing work towards a more systematic investigation of threats to the external validity of such experimental results. Using n-way model matching as a representative technique for supporting clone-and-own, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on variant sets exposing increasing degrees of divergence. We compile our observations into four hypotheses which are meant to serve as a basis for discussion and which need to be investigated in more detail in future research.},

The toolset architecture is now being evolved to build and manage plugins for multiple Industrial Analytics solutions (software systems and services) beyond asset health. This evolution is driving changes in the desired architecture qualities of the toolset; widening the stakeholder pool and influencing priorities; affecting the architecture tradeoffs and decisions; and triggering updates to the product line architecture, the guidance for applying it, and the current prototype of the toolset. We describe our experiences in handling this evolution, assess lessons learned, and discuss potential relevance to other product line scenarios.},

Costs are usually attributed either to the time it takes to test a configurable system or to its monetary value. Nevertheless, for the case of test effectiveness several quality metrics can be found in the literature.

abstract = {The notion of features is commonly used to describe the functional and non-functional characteristics of a system. In software product line engineering, features often become the prime entities of software reuse and are used to distinguish the individual products of a product line. Properly decomposing a product line into features, and correctly using features in all engineering phases, is core to the immediate and long-term success of such a system. Yet, although more than ten different definitions of the term feature exist, it is still a very abstract concept. Definitions lack concrete guidelines on how to use the notion of features in practice.To address this gap, we present a qualitative empirical study on actual feature usage in industry. Our study covers three large companies and an in-depth, contextualized analysis of 23 features, perceived by the interviewees as typical, atypical (outlier), good, or bad representatives of features. Using structured interviews, we investigate the rationales that lead to a feature's perception, and identify and analyze core characteristics (facets) of these features. Among others, we find that good features precisely describe customer-relevant functionality, while bad features primarily arise from rashly executed processes. Outlier features, serving unusual purposes, are necessary, but do not require the full engineering process of typical features.},

However, for organizations with settled development processes and a large code base, adopting an SPL approach may prove to be a daunting task. In this paper we present an industrial experimentation and a proposal for an SPL adoption in Heinsohn Business Technology (HBT), a software development company specialized in financial, transportation, mortgage-backed securities, and pension-fund solutions. We start by identifying and modeling multiple levels of variability inherent to the kind of developments undertaken by HBT. Next, we define restrictions inside every level as well as between the levels to fully characterize an HBT software product. To limit the impact on the organization development process, we use an extractive approach. This allows us to design core assets starting from current software artifacts. The overall approach is based on real-world software artifacts developed over the years by HBT, whose combinations result in approximately 4.88e11 possible product configurations.},

This paper introduces the High-Level Variability Language (HLVL), an expressive and extensible textual language that can be used as a modeling and an intermediate language for variability. HLVL was designed following an ontological approach, i.e., by defining their elements considering the meaning of the concepts existing on different variability languages. Our proposal not only provides a unified language based on a comprehensive analysis of the existing ones but also sets foundations to build tools that support different notations and their combination.},

During construction, selecting an appropriate design from among the set of possible designs for a Dynamic Software Product Line is a non-trivial task, and no existing Decision Support Framework provides guidance for this process.

abstract = {Configuration is a key enabling technology for the engineering of systems and software as wells as physical goods. A selection of configuration options (aka. features) is often enough to automatically generate a product tailored to the needs of a customer. It is common that not all combinations of features are possible in a given domain. Feature modeling is the de-facto standard for specifying features and their valid combinations. However, a pivotal hurdle for practitioners, researchers, and teachers in applying feature modeling is that there are hundreds of tools and languages available. While there have been first attempts to define a standard feature modeling language, they still struggle with finding an appropriate level of expressiveness. If the expressiveness is too high, the language will not be adopted, as it is too much effort to support all language constructs. If the expressiveness is too low, the language will not be adopted, as many interesting domains cannot be modeled in such a language. Towards a standard feature modeling notation, we propose the use of language levels with different expressiveness each and discuss criteria to be used to define such language levels. We aim to raise the awareness on the expressiveness and eventually contribute to a standard feature modeling notation.},

Our results include a prioritized list of communication related factors obtained by statistical analysis and the recognition and spread of the factors in the companies. We have recognized 5 interfaces with the Agile development team that need to be improved: system engineers (architects), product management, distributed teams, inter-project teams and sales unit. Few factors (involving inter-project communication) depend on the business drivers for the company. We also reveal that Agile teams need strategic and architectural inputs in order to be implanted in a large company employing Software Product Line Engineering. Academic and industrial training as well as different tactics for co-location would improve the communication skills of engineers. There is also a need for solutions, in the reference architecture, for fostering Agile Software Development: the goal is the combination of the focus on customer value of the teams, reusability, system requirements and avoidance of organizational dependencies.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) has arisen as an approach for developing a family of software-intensive systems at lower costs, within shorter time, and with higher quality. In particular, SPL is supported by a product line architecture (sometimes also referred to as reference architecture) that captures the architectures of a product family. In another context, a special type of architecture that contains knowledge about a specific domain has been increasingly investigated, resulting in the Reference Architecture research area. In spite of the positive impact of this type of architecture on reuse and productivity, the use of existing domain-specific reference architectures as basis of SPL has not been widely explored. The main contribution of this paper is to present how and when elements contained in existing reference architectures could contribute to the building of SPL artifacts during development of an SPL. We have observed that, in fact, reference architectures could make an important contribution to improving reuse and productivity, which are also important concerns in SPL.},

abstract = {Several relevant analyses on configurable software systems remain intractable because they require examining vast and highly-constrained configuration spaces. Those analyses could be addressed through statistical inference, i.e., working with a much more tractable sample that later supports generalizing the results obtained to the entire configuration space. To make this possible, the laws of statistical inference impose an indispensable requirement: each member of the population must be equally likely to be included in the sample, i.e., the sampling process needs to be "uniform". Various SAT-samplers have been developed for generating uniform random samples at a reasonable computational cost. Unfortunately, there is a lack of experimental validation over large configuration models to show whether the samplers indeed produce genuine uniform samples or not. This paper (i) presents a new statistical test to verify to what extent samplers accomplish uniformity and (ii) reports the evaluation of four state-of-the-art samplers: Spur, QuickSampler, Unigen2, and Smarch. According to our experimental results, only Spur satisfies both scalability and uniformity.},

abstract = {We report here an industrial application of the Product Line Engineering (PLE) for the development of electronic braking systems.The cost of software engineering in automotive control systems is increasing as new functions for safety, comfort, and improved fuel efficiency are integrated into electronic control units.Therefore, Component suppliers for automotive control systems adapt their products to the requirements of car manufacturers by modifying the software specifications, such that it makes minimal changes to the mechanical structure and the electrical and electronic (E/E) components hence reduces the cost. PLE is an effective approach to manage or even reduce the software variations resulting from these modifications.However, one problem is that the software specifications of automotive control systems need to be redesigned after system testing with vehicles. This is because vehicles consist of many mechanical parts manufactured by different suppliers, and the characteristics of the parts can interact with each other. This problem makes it difficult to reap the full benefits of PLE.We propose an approach to analyze the potential impact from such interactions by using a system model that expresses the system architecture that includes the parts of different suppliers. Based on this model, the software architecture was designed to localize the impact to several software components. Additionally, a feature model was designed to the enable management of the localized impact by expressing it as variability. This method helps software engineers specify the software components that can have an effect on the actual equipment, and determine which modifications to the software specifications are necessary.We applied PLE with the proposed method in the development of electronic brake control system. We confirmed that our approach greatly increased the efficiency of PLE for the development of such automotive control systems.},

abstract = {Deriving a product from a software product line may require various build tasks, such as model transformations, source code generation, preprocessing, compiling, as well as linking and packaging the compiled sources. Usually implemented using simple scripting languages, such as Apache ant or GNU make, build systems tend to become monolithic entities, which are intricate to adapt and maintain.This makes developing the build system for a multi-- product-line, which is composed of several sub--product-lines and maybe other configurable components, particularly challenging. Several, previously independent build systems--- possibly implemented using different build tools (ant, make, etc.)---need to be integrated. In this paper, we approach this by using models to describe the involved build tasks (including their input and output parameters) as well as their composition. An interpreter evaluates the models and executes the tasks in the composed order with the configured parameters to produce the final product.Our approach enables the interaction of build systems implemented with different tools with only little development effort, whereas the build order and parameter flow is made explicit in the models. We have started to apply our tooling to model the build system of two multi--product-lines, where it reveals sufficient expressiveness and clarifies the build system interaction.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) have recently shown promising potentials as integrated engineering methodology for (self-)adaptive software systems. Based on the software-configuration principles of software product lines, DSPL additionally foster reconfiguration capabilities to continuously adapt software products to ever-changing environmental contexts. However, in most recent works concerned with finding near-optimal reconfiguration decisions, real-time aspects of reconfiguration processes are usually out of scope. In this paper, we present a model-based methodology for specifying and automatically analyzing real-time constraints of reconfiguration decisions in a feature-oriented and compositional way. Those real-time aware DSPL specifications are internally translated into timed automata, a well-founded formalism for real-time behaviors. This representation allows for formally reasoning about consistency and worst-case/best-case execution-time behaviors of sequences of reconfiguration decisions. The technique is implemented in a prototype tool and experimentally evaluated with respect to a set of case studies1.},

However, it faces a typical efficiency issue as it can produce many mutants that are equivalent to the original system, making it impossible to generate test cases from them.We consider this problem when model-based mutation testing is applied to real-time system product lines, represented as timed automata. We define novel, time-specific mutation operators and formulate the equivalent mutant problem in the frame of timed refinement relations.Further, we study in which cases a mutation yields an equivalent mutant. Our theoretical results provide guidance to system engineers, allowing them to eliminate mutations from which no test case can be produced. Our evaluation, based on a proof-of-concept tool and an industrial case from the automotive domain, confirms the validity of our theory and demonstrates that our approach can eliminate many of the equivalent mutants (88% in our case study).},

abstract = {Self-adaptive systems (SAS) are exceptional systems, on account of their versatile composition, dynamic behavior and evolutive nature. Existing formal languages for the specification of SAS focus on adapting system elements to achieve a target goal, following specific rules, without much attention on the adaptation of requirements themselves. The State-Constraint Transition (SCT) modeling language enables the specification of dynamic requirements, both at the domain and application level, as a result of space or time variability. This language, evaluated in this paper, enables the specification of a variety of requirement types, for SASs from different domains, while generating a configuration, all configurations, and number of possible configurations, in milliseconds. This paper presents these results, namely; expressiveness, domain independence and scalability, from the viewpoint of designers and domain engineers, following a goal-question-metric approach. However, being primarily based on constraint programming (CP), the language suffers from drawbacks inherited from this paradigm, specifically time related requirements, like (e.g. order, frequency and staged requirements).},

abstract = {In a software product line (SPL) engineering approach, the addressed variability in core-code assets must be consistent with the specified domain variability, usually captured in a variability model, e.g., a feature model. Currently, the support for checking such consistency is limited, mostly when a single variability implementation technique is used, e.g., preprocessors in C. In realistic SPLs, variability is implemented using a combined set of traditional techniques, e.g., inheritance, overloading, design patterns. An inappropriate choice and combination of such techniques become the source of variability inconsistencies. In this paper, we present a tooled approach to check the consistency of variability between the specification and implementation levels, when several variability implementation techniques are used together. The proposed method models the implemented variability in terms of variation points and variants, in a forest-like structure, and uses slicing to partially check the resulting propositional formulas at both levels. As a result, it offers an early and automatic detection of inconsistencies when the mapping of variability between both levels is ideal, and with a possible extension to 1 -- to -- m mapping. We implemented and successfully applied the approach in four case studies. Our implementation, publicly available, detects inconsistencies in a very short time, which makes possible to ensure consistency earlier in the development process.},

In this context, to support large-scale reuse, components of a Software Product Line should be easy to maintain. Thus, developers should be more concerned with anomalies known as code smells and more than that, co-occurrences known as Inter-smell deserve to be further studied to verify their real impact on maintainability in SPL. Thus, this paper conducts a study to investigate the impact of Inter-smell occurrences on maintainability in MobileMedia and Health Watcher SPLs. The results show that the presence of co-occurrences of Inter-smell did not negatively impact the maintenance of MobileMedia and Health Watcher SPLs, unlike results found in other studies in the literature, and even more, our results indicate that the metric Lack of Cohesion of Methods is one of the most important for the maintainability of object-oriented SPLs.},

abstract = {Software errors are a major nuisance in software development and can lead not only to reputation damages, but also to considerable financial losses for companies. Therefore, numerous techniques for predicting software defects, largely based on machine learning methods, have been developed over the past decades. These techniques usually rely on code and process metrics in order to predict defects at the granularity of typical software assets, such as subsystems, components, and files. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of feature-oriented defect prediction: the prediction of defects at the granularity of features---domain-oriented entities abstractly representing (and often cross-cutting) typical software assets. Feature-oriented prediction can be beneficial, since: (i) particular features might be more error-prone than others, (ii) characteristics of features known as defective might be useful to predict other error-prone features, (iii) feature-specific code might be especially prone to faults arising from feature interactions. We present a dataset derived from 12 software projects and introduce two metric sets for feature-oriented defect prediction. We evaluated seven machine learning classifiers with three different attribute sets each, using our two new metric sets as well as an existing metric set from the literature. We observe precision and recall values of around 85% and better robustness when more diverse metrics sets with richer feature information are used.},

In real-world product lines, variability models can become large and complex comprising thousands of elements with hundreds of non-trivial dependencies. Visual and interactive techniques aim to reduce the (cognitive) complexity and support the user during challenging PLE tasks like product configuration. There are many visualization techniques described in the literature -- e.g., in Software Visualization -- and some isolated techniques have been applied in PLE tools. Nevertheless, the full potential of visualization in the context of PLE has not been exploited so far. This paper provides an overview of (1) available visualization techniques and criteria to judge their benefits and drawbacks for product configuration, (2) which have been applied in product configuration in PLE, and (3) which could be beneficial to support product configuration.

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) product lines appear in a wide range of applications of different domains (e.g., car's doors' windows, doors of a lift, etc.). The variability of these systems is large and as a result they can be configured into plenty of configurations. Testing each of the configurations can be time consuming as not only software has to be simulated, but also the hardware and the physical layer of the CPS, which is often modelled with complex mathematical models. Choosing the adequate test control strategy is critical when testing CPSs product lines. This paper presents a set of test control algorithms organized in an architecture of three layers (domain, application and simulation) for testing CPSs product lines. An illustrative example of a CPS product line is presented and three experiments are conducted to measure the performance of the proposed test control algorithms. We conclude that test scheduling and test suite minimization significantly help to reduce the overall test costs while preserving the test quality in CPSs product lines. In addition, we conclude that knowing the results of the previously tested configurations permits reducing the time for the detection of anomalous designs.},

abstract = {Software complexity may be reduced and productivity may be increased by the synergy of Component-Based Software Engineering and Software Product Line Engineering. The synergistic techniques decrease complexity by uplifting software artifacts to a higher abstraction level, namely the component level, and defining the interfaces, interactions, and contexts of such artifacts for composing software systems. Such synergistic techniques also facilitate productivity increase by promoting feature reusability, leveraging component replacement and offering selectivity among product variants. When applied to Distributed Real-time and Embedded (DRE) systems, however, these technologies must fulfill such systems' time-critical missions and numerous functional and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. New critical challenges to be solved are QoS sensitivity that influences functional validity and performance quality, tangled requirements that increase the complexity of requirements evaluation and abundant unsatisfactory design artifacts that introduce unnecessary development workload. With an aim to answer the QoS sensitivity problem and alleviate the requirements evaluation complexity and development workload in the analysis and design workflows of a DRE software product line construction, this dissertation introduces a Quality of Service-driven software Product Line engineering framework (QoSPL). Such a framework consists of domain engineering, application engineering and quantitative analysis processes. The domain engineering process analyzes QoS requirements, represented as the execution flows of application-specific and functionality-determined tasks, and their common and variable features by means of a grammar-oriented specification language. The application engineering process models a set of execution flows to describe the behavioral characteristics of a DRE system by means of formalism with concurrent and asynchronous behaviors in a timely manner. A DRE software product line can be realized by varying different components and/or execution flows. The quantitative analysis process utilizes evolutionary algorithms to simulate the influence factors of the deployment environment and to search the optimal simulation results. Less probable design artifacts in terms of their QoS requirements can be eliminated by means of programs written in a domain-specific language. Adaptive approaches written in the domain-specific language hasten the convergence rates and/or obtain better optimal results for the quantitative analysis process. This dissertation provides two case studies and a number of experimental results to show the benefits of using QoSPL for a DRE software product line construction.},

abstract = {Product line engineering derives product variants by selecting features. Understanding the correlation between feature selection and performance is important for stakeholders to acquire a desirable product variant. We infer such a correlation using four regression methods based on small samples of measured configurations, without additional effort to detect feature interactions. We conduct experiments on six real-world case studies to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the regression methods. A key finding in our empirical study is that one regression method, called Bagging, is identified as the best to make accurate and robust predictions for the studied systems.},

abstract = {Software-intensive systems belonging to a product line (PL) often have their shared architecture design available before they are developed. Therefore, the PL often has a large number of reusable and configurable requirements, which are naturally organized hierarchically based on the architecture of the PL. To enable reuse of requirements through configuration at the requirements engineering phase, it is important to provide a methodology (with tool support) to help practitioners to systematically and automatically develop structured and configuration-ready PL requirements repositories. Such a repository can cost-effectively facilitate the development of requirement repositories specific to individual products, i.e., individual systems. In addition, configurations to the repository at the requirements engineering phase of developing a system are part of its complete configurations and can be naturally carried on to downstream product configuration phases such as the design level configuration phase. A complete set system configurations can then be systematically obtained and managed. In this paper, we propose a methodology with tool support, named as Zen-ReqConfig, which is built on existing model-based technologies, natural language processing, and similarity measure techniques, for developing PL requirement repositories and facilitating requirements configuration. Zen-ReqConfig first automatically devises a hierarchical structure for a PL requirements repository. Then, it automatically identifies variabilities in textual requirements. Based on the developed configuration-ready PL requirements repository, it can then facilitate the configuration of products/systems at the requirements level. Zen-ReqConfig relies on two types of variability modeling techniques: cardinality-based feature modeling (CBFM) and a UML-based variability modeling methodology (named as SimPL). Both CBFM and SimPL have been used to address real-world variability modelling problems. To gain insights on the performance of Zen-ReqConfig, we evaluated it with five case studies and experimented with two different similarity measures and two different modelling methods: SimPL and CBFM. Results show that Zen-ReqConfig performed better when it is combined with the Jaro similarity measure. When Zen- ReqConfig is integrated with Jaro, it can (1) structure PL textual requirements under the most fit match criterion with high precision and recall, over 95% for both CBFM and SimPL; (2) identify variabilities in textual requirements under the most fit match criterion, with the average precision over 97% for SimPL and CBFM, and with the average recall over 94% for both SimPL and CBFM; and (3) generate repository structures within 1 second; 4) and allocate a requirement to the repository within 2 seconds on average. When looking into the impact of the two modelling methods on the performance of Zen-ReqConfig, we did not observe practical differences between SimPL and CBFM, implying that Zen-ReqConfig works well with both SimPL and CBFM.Pointer to the original paper: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10270-017-0641-6},

Maintenance of preprocessor-based product lines is a difficult task, as changes to the code base may unintentionally influence the behavior of uninvolved products. Hence, developers should be supported during maintenance. We present emergent contract interfaces to make product-line development more efficient and less error-prone. The key idea is that for a given maintenance point (i.e., an assignment), we calculate (a) features in the source code that may be affected and (b) assertions based on contracts defined in the code base. By means of a controlled experiment, we provide empirical evidence regarding efficiency and error-avoidance with emergent contract interfaces.},

abstract = {Context: More and more, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are using software to augment the functionality of their products and offerings. Variability management of software is becoming an interesting topic for SMEs with expanding portfolios and increasingly complex product structures. While the use of software product lines to resolve high variability is well known in larger organizations, there is less known about the practices in SMEs. Objective: This paper presents results from a survey of software developing SMEs. The purpose of the paper is to provide a snapshot of the current awareness and practices of variability modeling in organizations that are developing software with the constraints present in SMEs. Method: A survey with questions regarding the variability practices was distributed to software developing organizations in a region of Sweden that has many SMEs. The response rate was 13% and 25 responses are used in this analysis. Results: We find that, although there are SMEs that develop implicit software product lines and have relatively sophisticated variability structures for their solution space, the structures of the problem space and the product space have room for improvement. Conclusions: The answers in the survey indicate that SMEs are in situations where they can benefit from more structured variability management, but the awareness need to be raised. Even though the problem space similarity is high, there is little reuse and traceability activities performed. The existence of SMEs with qualified variability management and product line practices indicates that small organizations are capable to apply such practices.},

abstract = {Software companies encounter variability in space as variants of software systems need to be produced for different customers. At the same time, companies need to handle evolution in time because the customized variants need to be revised and kept up-to-date. This leads to a predicament in practice with many system variants significantly diverging from each other. Maintaining these variants consistently is difficult, as they diverge across space, i.e., different feature combinations, and over time, i.e., revisions of features. This work presents an automated feature revision location technique that traces feature revisions to their implementation. To assess the correctness of our technique, we used variants and revisions from three open source highly configurable software systems. In particular, we compared the original artifacts of the variants with the composed artifacts that were located by our technique. The results show that our technique can properly trace feature revisions to their implementation, reaching traces with 100% precision and 98% recall on average for the three analyzed subject systems, taking on average around 50 seconds for locating feature revisions per variant used as input.},

abstract = {Product Derivation is a key activity in Software Product Line Engineering. During this process, derivation operators modify or create core assets (e.g., model elements, source code instructions, components) by adding, removing or substituting them according to a given configuration. The result is a derived product that generally needs to conform to a programming or modeling language. Some operators lead to invalid products when applied to certain assets, some others do not; knowing this in advance can help to better use them, however this is challenging, specially if we consider assets expressed in extensive and complex languages such as Java. In this paper, we empirically answer the following question: which product line operators, applied to which program elements, can synthesize variants of programs that are incorrect, correct or perhaps even conforming to test suites? We implement source code transformations, based on the derivation operators of the Common Variability Language. We automatically synthesize more than 370,000 program variants from a set of 8 real large Java projects (up to 85,000 lines of code), obtaining an extensive panorama of the sanity of the operations.},

abstract = {The detection of interactions is a challenging task present in almost all stages of software development. In feature-oriented system design, this task is mainly investigated for interactions of features within a single system, detected by their emergent behaviors. We propose a formalism to describe interactions in hierarchies of feature-oriented systems (hierarchical interactions) and the actual situations where features interact (active interplays). Based on the observation that such interactions are also crucial in role-based systems, we introduce a compositional modeling framework based on concepts and notions of roles, comprising role-based automata (RBAs). To describe RBAs, we present a modeling language that is close to the input language of the probabilistic model checker Prism. To exemplify the use of RBAs, we implemented a tool that translates RBA models into Prism and thus enables the formal analysis of functional and non-functional properties including system dynamics, contextual changes, and interactions. We carry out two case studies as a proof of concept of such analyses: First, a peer-to-peer protocol case study illustrates how undesired hierarchical interactions can be discovered automatically. Second, a case study on a self-adaptive production cell demonstrates how undesired interactions influence quality-of-service measures such as reliability and throughput.},

During the development of network switch products at Hitachi Metals, Ltd., the number of development man-months increased as the number of product line-ups increased. Therefore, we shifted our development paradigm to product line development for efficient product development. We classified software assets as implementation assets, test assets, and design assets, and from these three assets, we extracted common objects and integrated them as reusable elements. By doing so, we promoted the efficient development of software assets and reduced the contradictions between the contents of the software assets. As a result, we reduced the amount of the source code by 53.1%. In this paper, we discuss the details of our technique and the effect of applying it. In addition, we discuss how you can apply our technique in the development of other products.},

US means that every (legal) configuration is equally likely to be selected. US yields statistically representative samples of a configuration space and can be used as a baseline to compare other sampling algorithms.We used existing algorithm called Smarch to uniformly sample SPL configurations. While uniform sampling alone was not enough to produce 100% 1-wise and 2-wise coverage, we used standard probabilistic analysis to explain our experimental results and to conjecture how uniform sampling may enhance the scalability of existing t-wise sampling algorithms.},

abstract = {Technical architectures (TAs) represent the computing infrastructure of a company with all its hardware and software components. Over the course of time, the number of TAs grows with the companies' requirements and usually a large variety of TAs has to be maintained. Core challenge is the missing information on relations between the existing variants of TAs, which complicates reuse of solutions across systems. However, identifying these relations is an expensive task as architects have to manually analyze each TA individually. Restructuring the existing TAs poses severe risks as often sufficient information is not available (e.g., due to time constraints). To avoid failures in productive systems and resulting loss of profit, companies continue to create new solutions without restructuring existing ones. This increased variability in TAs represents technical debt. In this paper, we adapt the idea of variability mining from the software product line domain and present an efficient and automatic mining algorithm to identify the common and varying parts of TAs by analyzing a potentially arbitrary number of TAs in parallel. Using the identified variability information, architects are capable of analyzing the relations of TAs, identifying reuse potential, and making well-founded maintenance decisions. We show the feasibility and scalability of our approach by applying it to a real-world industrial case study with large sets of TAs.},

abstract = {In certain domains, safety-critical software systems may remain operational for decades. To comply with changing requirements, new system variants are commonly created by copying and modifying existing ones. Typically denoted clone-and-own, software quality and overall maintainability are adversely affected in the long-run. With safety being pivotal, a fault in one variant may require the entire portfolio to be assessed. Thus, engineers need to maintain legacy systems dating back decades, implemented in programming languages such as Pascal. Software product lines (SPLs) can be a remedy but migrating legacy systems requires their prior analysis and comparison. For industrial software systems, this remains a challenge.In this paper, we introduce a comparison procedure and customizable metrics to allow for a fine-grained comparison of Pascal modules to the level of individual expressions. By that, we identify common parts of while also capturing different parts between modules as a basis for a transition towards anSPLs practice. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a case study with seven Pascal modules totaling 13,271 lines of code with an evolution-history of 25 years and show our procedure to be fast and precise. Furthermore, we elaborate on the case study and detail peculiarities of the Pascal modules, which are characteristic for an evolution-history of a quarter century.},

abstract = {Modern software systems have grown significantly in their size and complexity, therefore understanding how software systems behave when there are many configuration options, also called features, is no longer a trivial task. This is primarily due to the potentially complex interactions among the features. In this paper, we propose a novel mathematical model for performance-relevant, or quantitative in general, feature interactions, based on the theory of Boolean functions. Moreover, we provide two algorithms for detecting all such interactions with little measurement effort and potentially guaranteed accuracy and confidence level. Empirical results on real-world configurable systems demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {The large number of possible configurations makes it unfeasible to test every single system variant in a product line. Consequently, a small subset of the product line products must be selected, typically following combinatorial interaction testing approaches. Recently, many product line engineering approaches have considered the selection and prioritization of relevant products within the product line. In a further step, these products are thoroughly tested individually. However, the test cases that must be executed in each of the products are not always insignificant, and in systems such as Cyber-Physical System Product Lines (CPSPLs), their test execution time can vary from tens to thousands of seconds. This issue leads to spending a lot of time testing each individual product. To solve this problem we propose a search-based approach to perform the testing of product lines by allocating small number of test cases in each of the products. This approach increases the probability of detecting faults faster. Specifically, our search-based approach obtains a set of products, which are derived from using any state-of-the-art approach as inputs, and a set of attributed test cases. As an output a list of allocated test cases for each product is obtained. We also define a novel fitness function to guide the search and we propose corresponding crossover and mutation operators. The search and test process is iteratively repeated until the time budget is consumed. We performed an evaluation with a CPSPL as a case study. Results suggest that our approach can reduce the fault detection time by 61% and 65% on average when compared with the traditional test process and the Random Search algorithm respectively.},

We distinguish the important characteristics of such approaches based on the information used for sampling, the kind of algorithm, and the achieved coverage criteria. Furthermore, we give an overview on existing tools and evaluations of product sampling techniques. We share our insights on the state-of-the-art of product sampling and discuss potential future work.},

abstract = {The idea to treat domain-specific languages (DSL) as software product lines (SPL) of compilers/interpreters led to the introduction of language product lines (LPL). Although there exist various methodologies and tools for designing LPLs, they fail to provide basic IDE services for language variants-such as, syntax highlighting, auto completion, and debugging support-that programmers normally expect. While state-of-the-art language development tools permit the generation of basic IDE services for a specific language variant, most tools fail to consider and support reuse of basic IDE services of families of DSLs. Consequently, to provide basic IDE services for an LPL, one either generates them for the many language variants or designs a separate SPL of IDEs scattering language concerns. In contrast, we aim to piggyback basic IDE services on language features and provide an IDE for LPLs, which fosters their reuse when generating language variants. In detail, we extended the Neverlang language workbench to permit piggybacking syntax highlighting and debugging support on language components. Moreover, we developed an LPL-driven Eclipse-based plugin that includes a syntax highlighting editor and debugger for an LPL with piggybacked basic IDE services, i.e., where modular language features include the definition for syntax highlighting and debugging. Within this work, we introduce a general mechanism for fostering the basic IDE services' reuse and demonstrate its feasibility by realizing context-aware syntax highlighting for a Java-based family of role-oriented programming languages and providing debugging support for the family of JavaScript-based languages.},

In this paper we follow the iterative AR process, and report on the successful transfer of knowledge from a research project to a real industrial application.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering (SPLE) and variability enforcement techniques have been applied to run-time adaptive systems for quite some years, also in the context of multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. The focus has been mainly on (1) the pre-deployment phases of the development life cycle and (2) fine-grained (tenant-level), run-time activation of specific variants. However, with upcoming trends such as DevOps and continuous delivery and deployment, operational aspects become increasingly important.In this paper, we present our integrated vision on the positive interplay between SPLE and adaptive middleware for multi-tenant SaaS applications, focusing on the operational aspects of running and maintaining a successful SaaS offering. This vision, called Service Lines, is based on and motivated by our experience and frequent interactions with a number of Belgian SaaS providers.We concretely highlight and motivate a number of operational use cases that require advanced variability support in middleware and have promising added value for the economic feasibility of SaaS offerings. In addition, we provide a gap analysis of what is currently lacking from the perspectives of variability modeling and management techniques and middleware support, and as such sketch a concrete roadmap for continued research in this area.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) life cycle comprises a set of essential activities. Variability Management (VM) is one of its most important activities to the success of an SPL, especially those based on UML, as the solution space encompasses different diagrams and perspectives on variability. However, the lack of tools to support UML-based SPLs reflects difficulties in adopting this approach. This scenario motivated the development of SMartyModeling, an environment for engineering UML-based SPL. The SMartyModeling architecture was instantiated based on VMTools-RA, an existing reference architecture for software variability tools. VMTools-RA describes architectural requirements, elements and views on software variability, which aid one to instantiate variability tool architectures. The instantiation process started from the identification of requirements, selection of elements, modules, and visions of VMTools-RA, planning and design of the architectural solutions, implementation of modules and organization of features. We then analyzed the feasibility of adopting VMTools-RA for instantiating an specific tool architecture. In this sense, such instantiation is part of the development process of SMartyModeling, which includes the main activities related to VM. We also empirically evaluated SMartyModeling in three ways: (i) a field study to analyze the instantiation process and the decisions taken; (ii) a comparative experiment analyzing efficiency and effectiveness of SMartyModeling in relation to a general purpose UML tool; and (iii) an evaluation of aspects related to perceived ease of use and perceived usability. The results of such evaluations provide initial evidence VMTools-RA is feasible to instantiate specific architectures and SMartyModeling is feasible to support to VM for UML-based SPLs.},

Two important pillars of this initiative are "smart products" and "smart factories". From the perspective of product line engineering, these can be seen as two product lines (product line of factories and product line of goods) that need to be integrated for a common systems engineering approach. In this paper, we look at this problem from the perspective of configuration technologies, outline the research challenges in this area and illustrate our vision using an industrial example. The factory product line goes hand-in-hand with the product line of the products to be manufactured. Future research in product line engineering needs to consider an ecosystem of a multitude of stakeholders - e.g., factory component vendors, product designers, factory owners/operators and end-consumers.},

Several aspects influence the selection of features for a concrete product, such as dependencies and constraints between features, the different stakeholders involved in the process, the desired degree of quality, and cost constraints. This paper presents the vision of a configurator that will focus on providing indicators of security and performance for features and empowering its users to interactively observe the effect of the selected set of features on these two quality characteristics. We propose the use of reusable expert knowledge and static analysis for obtaining the indicators of security and performance, respectively. The two main issues to be investigated are: (1) to which degree the configuration process should be automated; and (2) how exactly to obtain indicators of security and performance for features that can be used to predict the security and performance of whole configurations.},

abstract = {Today's adaptive software systems (i) are often highly configurable product lines, exhibiting hundreds of potentially conflicting configuration options; (ii) are context dependent, forcing the system to reconfigure to ever-changing contextual situations at runtime; (iii) need to fulfill context-dependent performance goals by optimizing measurable nonfunctional properties. Usually, a large number of consistent configurations exists for a given context, and each consistent configuration may perform differently with regard to the current context and performance goal(s). Therefore, it is crucial to consider nonfunctional properties for identifying an appropriate configuration. Existing black-box approaches for estimating the performance of configurations provide no means for determining context-sensitive reconfiguration decisions at runtime that are both consistent and optimal, and hardly allow for combining multiple context-dependent quality goals. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach based on Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) for obtaining consistent and optimal reconfiguration decisions. We use training data obtained from simulations to learn performance-influence models. A novel integrated runtime representation captures both consistency properties and the learned performance-influence models. Our solution provides the flexibility to define multiple context-dependent performance goals. We have implemented our approach as a standalone component. Based on an Internet-of-Things case study using adaptive wireless sensor networks, we evaluate our approach with regard to effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability.},

A visual representation of these products is an important factor in terms of user experience. However, an analysis of 100+ existing configurators highlights that not all provide visual representations of configured products. One of the current challenges is the trade-off developers face between either the memory consuming use of pregenerated images of all the combinations of options, or rendering products on the fly, which is non trivial to implement efficiently. We believe that a new approach to associate product configurations to visual representations is needed to compose and render them dynamically. In this paper we present a formal statement of the problem and a model-driven perspective for addressing it as well as our ongoing work and further challenges.},

abstract = {SPL product customers might not always wait for the next core asset release. When an organization aims to react to market events, quick bug fixes or urgent customer requests, strategies are needed to support fast adaptation, e.g. with product-specific extensions, which are later propagated into the SPL. This leads to the grow-and-prune model where quick reaction to changes often requires copying and specialization (grow) to be later cleaned up by merging and refactoring (prune). This paper focuses on the grow stage. Here, application engineers branch off the core-asset Master branch to account for their products' specifics within the times and priorities of their customers without having to wait for the next release of the core assets. However, this practice might end up in the so-called "integration hell". When long-living branches are merged back into the Master, the amount of code to be integrated might cause build failures or requires complex troubleshooting. On these premises, we advocate for making application engineers aware of potential coordination problems right during coding rather than deferring it until merge time. To this end, we introduce the notion of "peering bar" for Version Control Systems, i.e. visual bars that reflect whether your product's features are being upgraded in other product branches. In this way, engineers are aware of what their peers are doing on the other SPL's products. Being products from the same SPL, they are based on the very same core assets, and hence, bug ixes or functional enhancements undertaken for a product might well serve other products. This work introduces design principles for peering bars. These principles are fleshed out for GitHub as the Version Control System, and pure::variants as the SPL framework.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have become one of the core-enabling technologies for multiple domains, such as manufacturing, healthcare, energy and transportation. Furthermore, these domains are demanding CPS to be highly-configurable in order to respond to multiple and changing market requirements. Testing these Highly-Configurable Cyber-Physical Systems (HCCPS) is challenging. First, when working with CPSs, considerable time is required in order to tackle physical processes during testing. And secondly, in highly-configurable systems, a large number of system variants need to be tested. Consequently, reducing HCCPS testing time is essential.In this context, a research work is presented to reduce the overall testing time of HCCPS, focusing on a merged strategy of product and test cases optimisation. In particular, two approaches are proposed in order to achieve the testing time reduction. The first approach aims to reduce the HCCPS testing time by an iterative allocation of products and test cases. The second approach aims to reduce the HCCPS testing time by a feedback driven dynamic and iterative allocation of products and test cases.A preliminary experiment has been undertaken to test the iterative allocation approach. In this experiment, products to be tested are selected and prioritised. Next, multiple testing iterations are perform until the time-budget is consumed. In each iteration a small number of test cases are allocated for each of the products to be tested. The experiment was evaluated with an academic HCCPS and preliminary results suggest that the proposed approach reduces the fault detection time when compared with traditional approaches.},

abstract = {Model-based languages such as MATLAB/Simulink play an essential role in the model-driven development of software systems. To comply with new requirements, it is common practice to create new variants by copying existing systems and modifying them. Commonly referred to as clone-and-own, severe problems arise in the long-run when no dedicated variability management is installed. To allow for a documented and structured reuse of systems, their variability information needs to be reverse-engineered. In this paper, we propose an advanced comparison procedure, the Matching Window Technique, and a customizable metric. Both allow us to overcome structural alterations commonly performed during clone-and-own. We analyze related MATLAB/Simulink models and determine, classify and represent their variability information in an understandable way. With our technique, we assist model engineers in maintaining and evolving existing variants.

abstract = {It is challenging to apply existing fault tolerance strategies for developing dependable Service Oriented systems, due to the lack of capabilities to adapt themselves at runtime to cope with dynamic changes of (a) user requirements and (b) the level of quality of services (QoS). In order to support such dynamic changes, we propose to adopt Software Product Line techniques. In particular, we adopt a feature model and product line architecture to capture the variability among software fault tolerance strategies based on design diversity. We propose an infrastructure that supports the strategy changes at runtime through dynamic management of variability and is responsible for the dependable mediation logic between service clients and redundant services. The infrastructure has an autonomous controller (i.e. managing a loop of collection, analysis, planning and execution), which is responsible for monitoring the changes of (i) QoS level and (ii) user requirements and decides, in accordance with high-level policies, an appropriate fault tolerance strategy to be executed. Also, our solution allows the dynamic provision of redundant services by describing them in terms of semantics. Finally, we performed a proof of concept which indicates the feasibility of the proposed solution.},

abstract = {Many approaches to software product line engineering have been founded on the development of a single product line platform. However as customer requirements change and new products are added to the product line, software producers recognize that the platform cannot be "stretched" indefinitely and a significant problem is striking a balance between development efficiency by increasing platform commonality and customer dissatisfaction from products with additional undesirable features and properties.One alternative is to develop multiple product lines (MPLs). However the challenge remains about what to include in a multiple product line platform. Drawing upon industrial experience of working with 4 companies, this paper explores the characteristics of the contexts in which MPLs are a viable alternative development strategy and then proposes a framework of approaches to platform development.},

abstract = {Tolerating inconsistencies is well accepted in design modeling because it is often neither obvious how to fix an inconsistency nor important to do so right away. However, there are technical reasons why inconsistencies are not tolerated in many areas of software engineering. The most obvious being that common reasoning engines are rendered (partially) useless in the presence of inconsistencies. This paper investigates automated strategies for tolerating inconsistencies during decision-making in product line engineering, based on isolating parts from reasoning that cause inconsistencies. We compare trade offs concerning incorrect and incomplete reasoning and demonstrate that it is even possible to fully eliminate incorrect reasoning in the presence of inconsistencies at the expense of marginally less complete reasoning. Our evaluation is based on seven medium-to-large size software product line case studies. It is important to note that our mechanism for tolerating inconsistencies can be applied to arbitrary SAT problems and thus the basic principles of this approach are applicable to other domains also.},

abstract = {The performance of business processes is evaluated and monitored with the aim of identifying whether strategic and operational goals are being achieved. Most approaches about performance measurement have been defined over traditional highly repetitive and well-structured processes. However, current organizational and business needs have encouraged the appearance of customizable processes to manage collections of process variants derived from a process, and loosely specified processes to manage non-repeatable and unpredictable processes. However, current techniques of performance measurement have not evolved to the same pace that business processes, thus generating a gap between processes and the measurement of their performance. The thesis introduced in this paper, is focused on enhancing the performance measurement of business processes by means of the improvement of existing techniques for the definition of process performance indicators and their applicability to different types of processes. With this purpose a set of artifacts, including a metamodel, notations, tools and methodologies will be developed. They will be validated by means of case studies based on real scenarios.},

abstract = {The annotation-based variability of the C preprocessor (CPP) has a bad reputation regarding comprehensibility and maintainability of software systems, but is widely adopted in practice. To assess the complexity of such systems' variability, several analysis techniques and metrics have been proposed in scientific communities. While most metrics seem reasonable at first glance, they do not generalize over all possible usages of C preprocessor variability that appear in practice. Consequently, some analyses may neglect the actual complexity of variability in these systems and may not properly reflect the real situation. In this paper, we investigate two types of variation points, namely negating and #else directives, to which we refer to as corner cases, as they are seldom explicitly considered in research. To investigate these directives, we rely on three commonly used metrics: lines of feature code, scattering degree, and tangling degree. We (1) describe how the considered directives impact these metrics, (2) unveil the resulting differences within 19 systems, and (3) propose how to address the arising issues. The results show that the corner cases appear regularly in variable feature code and can heavily change the results obtained with established metrics. We argue that we need to refine metrics and improve variability analysis techniques to provide more precise results, but we also need to reason about the meaning of corner cases and metrics.},

The complexity and large-scale of real feature models makes the manual analysis a tedious or even in-feasible task. For example, feature models from different domains such as operating systems or mobile ecosystems are available with thousands of features and complex relationships among them. The analysis of this kind of models requires efficient techniques and some have been explored in the past. In this thesis we propose to explore different efficient analysis alternatives. This research work will first explore parallel solutions for the Automated Analysis of Feature Models (AAFM). We review current solutions for the AAFM and, based on their efficiency and quality results, choose a few algorithmic solutions to analyze their availability of being parallelizable and propose their parallel version, to finally evaluate their results quality, performance and improvements respecting their sequential versions. We plan to explore later other efficient alternatives and summarize the advances to provide efficient ready-to-use tools for analysis purposes.},

However, it is still unclear where and how variability is realized in its source code repository. In this paper, we conduct a systematic analysis on the variability realization of the Android operation system. The analysis focuses on the usage of different variability realization mechanisms (e.g., Conditional Compilation) in the Android source code and build environment. Finally, the study provides qualitative and quantitative results that help to understand i) what variability-specific artefacts exist in the Android source repository using which variability mechanisms and techniques; ii) how these artefacts express and instantiate variability along the layered Android realization architecture.},

Furthermore, our approach limits the scope of the code search space by selecting only the code of those products that hold relevant requirements. We evaluate the overall effectiveness of our approach in the industrial domain of train control software. Our results show that our approach improves in 18.1% the results of precision with regard to searching directly into code, which encourages further research in this direction.},

abstract = {This work studies systematic reuse in the context of self-adaptive software systems. In our work, we realized that managing variability for such platforms is different compared to traditional platforms, primarily due to the run-time variability and system uncertainties. Motivated by the fact that recent trends show that self-adaptation will be used more often in future system generation and that software reuse state-of-practice or research do not provide sufficient support, we have investigated the problems and possibly resolutions in this context. We have analyzed variability for these systems, using a systematic reuse prism, and identified a research gap in variability management. The analysis divides variability handling into four activities: (1) identify variability, (2) constrain variability, (3) implement variability, and (4) manage variability. Based on the findings we envision a reuse framework for the specific domain and present an example framework that addresses some of the identified challenges. We argue that it provides basic support for engineering self-adaptive software systems with systematic reuse. We discuss some important avenues of research for achieving the vision.},

Furthermore, security is not a static object but a moving target, adding variability.For this, an approach to systematically address security concerns in software product lines is needed. It should consider security separate from other variability dimensions. The main challenges to realize this are: (i) expressing security and its variability, (ii) selecting the right solution, (iii) properly instantiating a solution, and (iv) verifying and validating it.In this paper, we present our research agenda towards addressing the aforementioned challenges.},

Despite the many benefits that come with using the product-line approach, many companies are hesitant to migrate to an integrated platform for their product variants because such a migration is considered challenging and risky. Often this perception is because the migration is seen as a drastic change that is not easy to verify and assure developers that the migrated products still operate as before. In this research we propose to develop a language structure (or abstract representation) of artifacts in a software asset base that would facilitate an incremental migration of several code bases to an integrated platform. We further seek to propose and evaluate techniques for verifying the migrated product line with respect to its original code bases.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines are typically used to support development of a software product family and not a software product population, which denotes a broader and more diverse range of software products. We present a Software Product Line Infrastructure (SPLI) that has been designed to increase the reuse of software efforts in product populations. The SPLI takes a bottom-up approach by structuring product features in highly reusable software components called Active Components which contain different types of artefacts. Variability is expressed using domain-specific models and formal variability models. Variability is bound during product derivation by executing model-to-artefact transformations. Components are active because they are invoked during the derivation process, thereby empowering the component. The SPLI enables step-wise refinements of applications by allowing specialization and composition of models before variability is bound. A prototype of the SPLI has been created that was used to develop and evaluate an experimental software product line. It is concluded that within the context of our experimental software product line the SPLI improves software reuse in software product populations.},

abstract = {Variability intensive systems may include several thousand features allowing for an enormous number of possible configurations, including wrong ones (e.g. the derived product does not compile). For years, engineers have been using constraints to a priori restrict the space of possible configurations, i.e. to exclude configurations that would violate these constraints. The challenge is to find the set of constraints that would be both precise (allow all correct configurations) and complete (never allow a wrong configuration with respect to some oracle). In this paper, we propose the use of a machine learning approach to infer such product-line constraints from an oracle that is able to assess whether a given product is correct. We propose to randomly generate products from the product line, keeping for each of them its resolution model. Then we classify these products according to the oracle, and use their resolution models to infer cross-tree constraints over the product-line. We validate our approach on a product-line video generator, using a simple computer vision algorithm as an oracle. We show that an interesting set of cross-tree constraint can be generated, with reasonable precision and recall.},

abstract = {In systems engineering, practitioners shall explore numerous architectural alternatives until choosing the most adequate variant. The decision-making process is most of the time a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone activity. The exploration and justification of architectural solutions is ad-hoc and mainly consists in a series of tries and errors on the modeling assets. In this paper, we report on an industrial case study in which we apply variability modeling techniques to automate the assessment and comparison of several candidate architectures (variants). We first describe how we can use a model-based approach such as the Common Variability Language (CVL) to specify the architectural variability. We show that the selection of an architectural variant is a multi-criteria decision problem in which there are numerous interactions (veto, favor, complementary) between criteria.We present a tooled process for exploring architectural variants integrating both CVL and the MYRIAD method for assessing and comparing variants based on an explicit preference model coming from the elicitation of stakeholders' concerns. This solution allows understanding differences among variants and their satisfactions with respect to criteria. Beyond variant selection automation improvement, this experiment results highlight that the approach improves rationality in the assessment and provides decision arguments when selecting the preferred variants.},

abstract = {Identifying and extracting parts of a system's implementation for reuse is an important task for re-engineering system variants into Software Product Lines (SPLs). An SPL is an approach that enables systematic reuse of existing assets across related product variants. The re-engineering process to adopt an SPL from a set of individual variants starts with the location of features and their implementation, to be extracted and migrated into an SPL and reused in new variants. Therefore, feature location is of fundamental importance to the success in the adoption of SPLs. Despite its importance, existing feature location techniques struggle with huge, complex, and numerous system artifacts. This is the scenario of ArgoUML-SPL, which stands out as the most used case study for the validation of feature location approaches. In this paper we use an automated feature location technique and apply it to the ArgoUML feature location challenge posed.},

abstract = {The combination of service-orientation and software product line engineering, called Service-Oriented Product Line Engineering (SOPLE) have received attention by researchers and practitioners in the last years, and these areas can address issues of each other. One service-orientation issue is service identification. It consists of determining candidate services to a service-oriented environment based on pre-existing software artifacts, e.g., business process, source code, and so on. In order to provide a systematic identification of services, there are many available service identification methods in the literature, regarding different understanding of services, goals, and techniques. Due to this heterogeneity, this paper presents an in-depth comparison of service identification methods as well as a recommendation of the most suitable ones in the SOPLE context. This work can help the decision making of the most suitable method according to stakeholders' needs.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is widely used to capture and manage commonalities and variabilities in software product lines. Cardinality-based feature models are used when variability applies not only to the selection or exclusion of features but also to the number of times a feature can be included in a product. Feature cardinalities are usually considered to apply in either a local or global scope. However, we have identified that these interpretations are insufficient to capture the variability of cloud environments. In this paper, we redefine cardinality-based feature models to allow multiple relative cardinalities between features and we discuss the effects of relative cardinalities on feature modeling semantics, consistency and cross-tree constraints. To evaluate our approach we conducted an analysis of relative cardinalities in four cloud computing providers. In addition, we developed tools for reasoning on feature models with relative cardinalities and performed experiments to verify the performance and scalability of the approach. The results from our study indicate that extending feature models with relative cardinalities is feasible and improves variability modeling, particularly in the case of cloud environments.},

Any given approach for software product lines will likely lead to both positive and negative consequences during unanticipated software evolution. Unfortunately, we know little about the evolvability characteristics of SPL approaches that concern both modelling and implementation, limiting our ability to make rational and disciplined decisions about adoption. We conduct a case study into the unanticipated evolution of a software product family using two approaches: separate products versus a common codebase using delta-oriented programming (DOP). We compare the ease of change within the two versions through a set of quantitative measurements and qualitative observations. We find that both versions have strengths and weaknesses: complexity and incomplete support from DOP tools versus significant duplication and error-proneness in the separate products.},

To cope with this problem, we present DyMMer, a tool to support the automatic extraction of quality measures from feature models in DSPLs.

abstract = {Identifying features and their relations (i.e., variation points) is crucial in the process of migrating single software systems to software product lines (SPL). Various approaches have been proposed to perform feature extraction automatically from different artifacts, for instance, feature location in legacy code. Usually such approaches a) omit variability information and b) rely on artifacts that reside in advanced phases of the development process, thus, being only of limited usefulness in the context of SPLs. In contrast, feature and variability extraction from natural language (NL) documents is more favorable, because a mapping to several other artifacts is usually established from the very beginning. In this paper, we provide a multi-dimensional overview of approaches for feature and variability extraction from NL documents by means of a systematic literature review (SLR). We selected 25 primary studies and carefully evaluated them regarding different aspects such as techniques used, tool support, or accuracy of the results. In a nutshell, our key insights are that i) standard NLP techniques are commonly used, ii) post-processing often includes clustering &amp; machine learning algorithms, iii) only in rare cases, the approaches support variability extraction, iv) tool support, apart from text pre-processing is often not available, and v) many approaches lack a comprehensive evaluation. Based on these observations, we derive future challenges, arguing that more effort need to be invested for making such approaches applicable in practice.},

The appropriateness of the choice can also change as an organisation's internal and external business environment context changes. In this paper we provide a management tool to help guide that decision making. We set out four broad types of business strategy and map these against four different types of reusable software development strategy. The four types of business strategy correspond to different business environments which are in turn characterised by different combinations of market predictability (low to high) and an organisation's ability to influence it (low to high). To demonstrate the framework as an analytical tool we have mapped examples of different organisations reusable software strategies and explained some circumstances in which that organisation's strategy may change.},

In order to support variable products in a model-based systems engineering environment, we describe a tool-supported approach that allows us to annotate SysML models with variability data. Such variability information is exchanged between the system modeling tool and variability management tools through the Variability Exchange Language. The contribution of the paper includes the introduction of the model-based product line engineering tool chain and its application on a practical case study at Volvo Construction Equipment.

These systems need to be adjustable to cope with different contextual factors like changes in resources or requirements. Still, adaptation is often performed manually. In addition, different product variants of access control systems need to developed together systematically. These characteristics demand a product line engineering approach for enhanced reuse. Moreover, to cope with uncertainty at runtime, adaptivity, i.e., switching between variations in a cyber-physical domain (reconfiguration) and adjusting access policies (behavior adaptation), needs to be supported.In this position paper, we sketch an approach for engineering dynamic access control systems based on core concepts from dynamic software product lines and executable runtime models.

In industrial scenarios, CAO consumes high amounts of time and effort without guaranteeing good results. We propose a novel approach, Computer Assisted CAO (CACAO), that given the natural language requirements of a new product, and the legacy products from that family, ranks the legacy methods in the family for each of the new product requirements according to their relevancy to the new development. We evaluated our approach in the industrial domain of train control software. Without CACAO, software engineers tasked with the development of a new product had to manually review a total of 2200 methods in the family. Results show that CACAO can reduce the number of methods to be reviewed, and guide software engineers towards the identification of relevant legacy methods to be reused in the new product.},

Finding a desirable variant is often difficult, due to the huge configuration space and usually conflicting objectives (e.g., lower cost and higher performance). This scenario can be characterized as a multi-objective optimization problem applied to SPLs. We address the problem using an exact and an approximate algorithm and compare their accuracy, time consumption, scalability, parameter setting requirements on five case studies with increasing complexity. Our empirical results show that (1) it is feasible to use exact techniques for small SPL multi-objective optimization problems, and (2) approximate methods can be used for large problems but require substantial effort to find the best parameter setting for acceptable approximation which can be ameliorated with known good parameter ranges. Finally, we discuss the tradeoff between accuracy and time consumption when using exact and approximate techniques for SPL multi-objective optimization and guide stakeholders to choose one or the other in practice.},

abstract = {Ideally the variability of a product line is represented completely and correctly by its variability model. However, in practice additional variability is often represented on the level of the build system or in the code. Such a situation may lead to inconsistencies, where the actually realized variability does not fully correspond to the one described by the variability model. In this paper we focus on configuration mismatches, i.e., cases where the effective variability differs from the variability as it is represented by the variability model. While previous research has already shown that these situations still exist even today in well-analyzed product lines like Linux, so far it was unclear under what circumstances such issues occur in reality. In particular, it is open what types of configuration mismatches occur and how severe they are. Here, our contribution is to close this gap by presenting a detailed manual analysis of 80 configuration mismatches in the Linux 4.4.1 kernel and assess their criticality. We identify various categories of configuration issues and show that about two-thirds of the configuration mismatches may actually lead to kernel misconfigurations.},

Often these analyses do not support numerical features with constraints because propositional formulas use only Boolean variables. Some automated solvers can represent numerical features natively, but are limited in their ability to count and Uniform Random Sample (URS) configurations, which are key operations to derive unbiased statistics on configuration spaces.Bit-blasting is a technique to encode numerical constraints as propositional formulas. We use bit-blasting to encode Boolean and numerical constraints so that we can exploit existing #SAT solvers to count and URS configurations. Compared to state-of-art Satisfiability Modulo Theory and Constraint Programming solvers, our approach has two advantages: 1) faster and more scalable configuration counting and 2) reliable URS of SPL configurations. We also show that our work can be used to extend prior SAT-based SPL analyses to support numerical features and constraints.},

abstract = {A Feature Model is a tree like structure that represents the commonality and variability in Software Product Lines. During analysis required information is extracted from a feature model. In the literature a number of techniques have been presented for the analysis of feature models.Quality of a Feature Model is of prime significance because it is used for the development of families of software. The quality of feature models is affected by the presence of errors. There is a need for a mechanism that could enhance the quality of a feature model by removing all inconsistency, anomaly and redundancy based errors. I am proposing a mathematical technique for the analysis of Feature Models that will lead towards their quality enhancement.},

abstract = {Safety critical systems (e.g., an avionics control system for safe flight) are often required to achieve certification under pre-established standards (e.g., DO-178B for software considerations in airborne systems and equipment certification). We have been working with our industrial partner for the last three years to develop product line assets for their avionics software product line (SPL) and, recently, we encountered two major challenges regarding certification. Firstly, an individual product must be certified, but each may require a different certification level: there might be variations in the certification requirements according to specific system usage contexts. Secondly, certification involves not only product but also process, as standards such as DO-178B also assess the quality of the development process. In this paper, we propose to include a certification view during feature modelling to provide a better understanding of the relationships between features and a certification level required for each product. The experience of introducing certification into the design model of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) SPL is presented to illustrate some key ideas. We also describe the lessons we have learned from this experience.},

abstract = {In model-driven software product line engineering (SPLE) the superset of products is developed over models. A feature model typically states the discriminating and common factors of the software. In annotative approaches model elements are associated with variability annotations which are boolean expressions over the features defining in which products the elements are visible. When the product line is defined over different models, the developer wants to annotate the model of one type and transform it to different representations, e.g., a (UML) class diagram into a relational database schema for establishing an object-relational mapping. Assigning the annotations manually to the target model is an error-prone and laborious task. In a black-box approach we automatically assign the correct annotations to the target model without analyzing the transformation specification. It is an easy task in the case of 1:1 mappings where the annotation of the source element is copied to the corresponding element in the target model. Typically this kind of information is available, e.g., in traces written during the transformation execution. In reality, more complex mappings are frequent but the correspondences harder to determine. Assuming a target model is already annotated with the annotation of 1:1 correspondences, a certain number of elements remains without annotations. This paper contributes strategies to determine missing annotations in partially annotated models. We compare a global include strategy with more sophisticated ones which take the model structure into account. Since we apply missing annotations locally on one model, we solve a general SPLE problem where completely annotated models reduce the manual user effort and are desirable for filtering.},

abstract = {The optimization of software to be (more) energy efficient is becoming a major concern for the software industry. Although several techniques have been presented to measure energy consumption for software, none has addressed software product lines (SPLs). Thus, to measure energy consumption of a SPL, the products must be generated and measured individually, which is too costly.In this paper, we present a technique and a prototype tool to statically estimate the worst case energy consumption for SPL. The goal is to provide developers with techniques and tools to reason about the energy consumption of all products in a SPL, without having to produce, run and measure the energy in all of them.Our technique combines static program analysis techniques and worst case execution time prediction with energy consumption analysis. This technique analyzes all products in a feature-sensitive manner, that is, a feature used in several products is analyzed only once, while the energy consumption is estimated once per product.We implemented our technique in a tool called Serapis. We did a preliminary evaluation using a product line for image processing implemented in C. Our experiments considered 7 products from such line and our initial results show that the tool was able to estimate the worst-case energy consumption with a mean error percentage of 9.4% and standard deviation of 6.2% when compared with the energy measured when running the products.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a family of programs that are differentiated by features --- increments in functionality. Systematically testing an SPL is challenging because it requires running each test of a test suite against a combinatorial number of programs. Feature models capture dependencies among features and can (1) reduce the space of programs to test and (2) enable accurate categorization of failing tests as failures of programs or the tests themselves, not as failures due to illegal combinations of features. In practice, sadly, feature models are not always available.We introduce SPLif, the first approach for testing SPLs that does not require the a priori availability of feature models. Our insight is to use a profile of passing and failing test runs to quickly identify failures that are indicative of real problems in test or code rather than specious failures due to illegal feature combinations.Experimental results on five SPLs and one large configurable system (GCC) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. SPLif enabled the discovery of five news bugs in GCC, three of which have already been fixed.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are often tested at different test levels following "X-in-the-Loop" configurations: Model-, Software- and Hardware-in-the-loop (MiL, SiL and HiL). While MiL and SiL test levels aim at testing functional requirements at the system level, the HiL test level tests functional as well as non-functional requirements by performing a real-time simulation. As testing CPS product line configurations is costly due to the fact that there are many variants to test, test cases are long, the physical layer has to be simulated and co-simulation is often necessary. It is therefore extremely important to select the appropriate test cases that cover the objectives of each level in an allowable amount of time. We propose an efficient test case selection approach adapted to the "X-in-the-Loop" test levels. Search algorithms are employed to reduce the amount of time required to test configurations of CPS product lines while achieving the test objectives of each level. We empirically evaluate three commonly-used search algorithms, i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA), Alternating Variable Method (AVM) and Greedy (Random Search (RS) is used as a baseline) by employing two case studies with the aim of integrating the best algorithm into our approach. Results suggest that as compared with RS, our approach can reduce the costs of testing CPS product line configurations by approximately 80% while improving the overall test quality.},

abstract = {A Software Product Line is a set of software systems of a domain, which share some common features but also have significant variability. A feature model is a variability modeling artifact which represents differences among software products with respect to variability relationships among their features. Having a feature model along with a reference model developed in the domain engineering lifecycle, a concrete product of the family is derived by selecting features in the feature model (referred to as the configuration process) and by instantiating the reference model. However, feature model configuration can be a cumbersome task because: 1) feature models may consist of a large number of features, which are hard to comprehend and maintain; and 2) many factors including technical limitations, implementation costs, stakeholders' requirements and expectations must be considered in the configuration process. Recognizing these issues, a significant amount of research efforts has been dedicated to different aspects of feature model configuration such as automating the configuration process. Several approaches have been proposed to alleviate the feature model configuration challenges through applying visualization and interaction techniques. However, there have been limited empirical insights available into the impact of visualization and interaction techniques on the feature model configuration process. In this paper, we present a set of visualization and interaction interventions for representing and configuring feature models, which are then empirically validated to measure the impact of the proposed interventions. An empirical study was conducted by following the principles of control experiments in software engineering and by applying the well-known software quality standard ISO 9126 to operationalize the variables investigated in the experiment. The results of the empirical study revealed that the employed visualization and interaction interventions significantly improved completion time of comprehension and changing of the feature model configuration. Additionally, according to results, the proposed interventions are easy-to-use and easy-to-learn for the participants.},

abstract = {Variability is an inherent property of software systems to create families of products dealing with needs of different customers and environments. However, some practices to manage variability may incur technical debt. For example, the use of opportunistic reuse strategies, e.g., clone-and-own, harms maintenance and evolution activities; or deciding to abandon variability management and deriving a single product with all the features might threaten system usability. These examples are common problems found in practice but, to the best of or knowledge, not properly investigated from the perspective of technical debt. To expand the knowledge on the research and practice of technical debt in the perspective of variability management, we report results of this phenomenon, which we defined as variability debt. Our work is based on 52 industrial case studies that report problems observed in the use of opportunistic reuse. The results show that variability debt is caused by business, operational and technical aspects; leads to complex maintenance, creates difficulties to customize and create new products, misuse of human resources, usability problems; and impacts artifacts along the whole life-cycle. Although some of these issues are investigated in the field of systematic variability management, e.g., software product lines, our contribution is to present them from a technical debt perspective to enrich and create synergies between the two fields. As additional contribution, we present a catalog of variability debts in the light of technical debts found in the literature.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) has been successfully consolidated as an approach for systematic reuse. The adoption of the SPL approach aims at increasing the reuse of requirements and artifacts, thus reusing documents, source code and artifacts and ensuring better quality control to software production in a large-scale. One of the essential activities for SPL management is the modeling of variability. Variability modeling in UML-based SPL has been carried out mostly using the UML Profiling mechanism, in which new stereotypes and tagged values are created for such purpose. The available option in general-purpose UML tools for exporting UML models is through XMI files, standardized by OMG. This option is important to process XMI files in particular environments or tools, for example, managing variabilities, generating product configurations from an SPL, and even collecting metrics, and estimating SPLs. However, different versions, tool restrictions, and different file standards compromise operations involving XMI files. In this scenario, the industry has increasingly required the supporting tools for the SPL approach. However, the current support tools are mainly restricted to the problem space based on feature modeling and present problems with data integration with other tools. Therefore, we developed SMartyModeling, an environment for engineering UML-based SPLs in which variabilities are modeled as stereotypes using any UML compliant profile. This paper presents an overview of SMartyModeling, describing its motivation, main components, and available features.},

abstract = {Dynamic software product lines demand self-adaptation of their behavior to deal with runtime contextual changes in their environment and offer a personalized product to the user. However, taking user preferences and context into account impedes the manual configuration process, and thus, an efficient and automated procedure is required. To automate the configuration process, context-aware recommendation techniques have been acknowledged as an effective mean to provide suggestions to a user based on their recognized context. In this work, we propose a collaborative filtering method based on tensor factorization that allows an integration of contextual data by modeling an N-dimensional tensor User-Feature-Context instead of the traditional two-dimensional User-Feature matrix. In the proposed approach, different types of non-functional properties are considered as additional contextual dimensions. Moreover, we show how to self-configure software product lines by applying our N-dimensional tensor factorization recommendation approach. We evaluate our approach by means of an empirical study using two datasets of configurations derived for medium-sized product lines. Our results reveal significant improvements in the predictive accuracy of the configuration over a state-of-the-art non-contextual matrix factorization approach. Moreover, it can scale up to a 7-dimensional tensor containing hundred of configurations in a couple of milliseconds.},

abstract = {Software-intensive systems often consist of multiple components that interact to realize complex requirements. An additional dimension of complexity arises when one designs many variants of a system at once, that is, a software product line (SPL). We propose a scenario-based approach to design SPLs, based on a combination of Modal Sequence Diagrams (MSDs) and a feature model. It consists in associating every MSD to the set of variants that have to satisfy its specification. Variability constitutes a new source of complexity, which can lead to inconsistencies in the specification of one or multiple variants. It is therefore crucial to detect these inconsistencies, and to produce a controller for each variant that makes it behave so that it satisfies its specification. We present a new controller synthesis technique that checks the absence of inconsistencies in all variants at once, thereby more radically exploiting the similarities between them. Our method first translates the MSD specification into a variability-aware B\"{u}chi game, and then solves this game for all variants in a single execution. We implemented the approach in ScenarioTools, a software tool which we use to evaluate our algorithms against competing methods.},

CIIMS is the system software which systemizes heterogeneous clinical instruments. These instruments require their particular management so that various parts of CIIMS are forced to be changed. This makes it difficult to create development plans to connect new instruments to CIIMS. In this paper we summarize a new estimate method called the Architecture Domain Matrix (ADM) method which effectively solved this problem in our experience. In ADM each architectural element is further decomposed into clinical operation flow elements and core assets of software are extracted from these elements. This method estimates the CIIMS commonality with precision and finally enables to successfully connect new instruments. In addition this method provides a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and supports development team building. WBS is generated by collecting all the changes for each operational flow element. A development team suitable for change is organized by taking into consideration all the changes for each architecture element. We integrated three different instruments into CIIMS in 18 months after applying this method to a real project and achieved 2.5 times greater productivity with the embedded software than that with our previous non-SPL process.},

However, variability can be represented in the form of a topology in domains where variability is about connecting components in a certain order, in specific interconnected hierarchies, or in different quantities.In this experience report, we explore topological variability within a case study of large-scale fire alarm systems. We identify core characteristics of the variability, derive modeling requirements, model the variability using UML2 class diagrams, and discuss the applicability of further variability modeling languages. We show that, although challenging, class diagrams can suffice to represent topological variability in order to generate a configurator tool. In contrast, modeling parallel and recursive structures, cycles, informal constraints, and orthogonal hierarchies were among the main experienced challenges that require further research.},

abstract = {Many systems in the industrial automation domain include information systems. They manage manufacturing processes and control numerous distributed hardware and software components. In current practice, the development and reuse of such systems is costly and time-consuming, due to the variability of systems' topology and processes. Up to now, product line approaches for systematic modeling and management of variability have not been well established for such complex domains.In this paper, we present a model-based approach to support the derivation of systems in the target domain. The proposed architecture of the derivation infrastructure enables feature-, topology- and process configuration to be integrated into the multi-staged derivation process. We have developed a prototype to prove feasibility and improvement of derivation efficiency. We report the evaluation results that we collected through semi-structured interviews from domain stakeholders. The results show high potential to improve derivation efficiency by adopting the approach in practice. Finally, we report the lessons learned that raise the opportunities and challenges for future research.},

abstract = {If traceability links between requirements and source code are not clarified when conducting maintenance and enhancements for the same series of software products, engineers cannot immediately find the correction location in the source code for requirement changes. However, manually recovering links in a large group of products requires significant costs and some links may be overlooked. Here, we propose a semi-automatic method to recover traceability links between requirements and source code in the same series of large software products. In order to support differences in representation between requirements and source code, we recover links by using the configuration management log as an intermediary. We refine the links by classifying requirements and code elements in terms of whether they are common or specific to the products. As a result of applying our method to real products that have 60KLOC, we have recovered valid traceability links within a reasonable amount of time. Automatic parts have taken 13 minutes 36 seconds, and non-automatic parts have taken about 3 hours, with a recall of 76.2% and a precision of 94.1%. Moreover, we recovered some links that were unknown to engineers. By recovering traceability links, software reusability will be improved, and software product line introduction will be facilitated.},

The resulting probabilistic configurations and behaviour converge seamlessly in a semantics based on DTMCs, thus enabling quantitative analyses ranging from the likelihood of certain behaviour to the expected average cost of products. This is supported by a Maude implementation of QFLan, integrated with the SMT solver Z3 and the distributed statistical model checker MultiVeStA.

abstract = {In Software Product Line (SPL) engineering, software products are build in families rather than individually. Many critical software are nowadays build as SPLs and most of them obey hard real-time requirements. Formal methods for verifying SPLs are thus crucial and actively studied. The verification problem for SPL is, however, more complicated than for individual systems; the large number of different software products multiplies the complexity of SPL model-checking. Recently, promising model-checking approaches have been developed specifically for SPLs. They leverage the commonality between the products to reduce the verification effort. However, none of them considers real time.In this paper, we combine existing SPL verification methods with established model-checking procedures for real-time systems. We introduce Featured Timed Automata (FTA), a formalism that extends the classical Timed Automata with constructs for modelling variability. We show that FTA model-checking can be achieved through a smart combination of real-time and SPL model checking.},

This model not only shows the different components that have to be installed when deploying the system at the different levels established by the ERTMS/ETCS standards, but it also helps to identify and discuss specific issues, such as the borders between onboard and wayside equipment, different manufacturers of the subsystems, interoperability among systems developed at different levels, backward compatibility of trains equipped with higher level equipment running on lines equipped with lower level equipment, and evolution towards future trends of railway signalling. The feature model forms the basis for formal modelling of the behaviour of the critical components of the system and for evaluating the overall cost, effectiveness and sustainability, for example by adding cost and performance attributes to the feature model.},

abstract = {Model transformations are crucial in model-driven software engineering (MDSE). While combining MDSE and software product line engineering (SPLE) techniques, summarized as model-driven product line engineering (MDPLE), promises increased productivity by relying on organized reuse, the benefits are impeded by transformation specifications designed exclusively for single-variant models. Applying single-variant model transformations to multi-variant input models results in output models lacking the variability information. Multi-variant model transformations (MVMT), which preserve variability information, have only recently been understood as an explicit research problem. In this paper, we propose an a posteriori approach towards MVMT. Following the paradigm of organized reuse, we propose to employ single-variant model transformations without modifications in a first step, and to transfer variability information afterwards based on the artifacts provided by the single-variant transformation specification. In particular, we implemented this approach for the well-known model-to-model transformation language ATL. To deduce variability information, the execution artifacts (trace and execution model) are analyzed. Then, variability annotations are transfered to the target model automatically. The implementation is evaluated based on a practically example of a Graph product line. Results exhibit that our approach outperforms the conventional solution with respect to user effort, accuracy and performance.},

We propose to identify model patterns by human-in-the-loop and conceptualize them as reusable model fragments. The approach provides the means to identify and extract those model patterns and further apply them to existing product models. Model fragments obtained by applying our approach seem to perform better than mechanically found ones. It turns out that the repetition of a fragment does not guarantee its relevance as reusable asset for the SPL engineers and vice versa, a fragment that has not been repeated yet, may be relevant as a reusable asset. We have validated these ideas with our industrial partner BSH, an induction hobs manufacturer that generates the firmware of their products from a model-driven SPL.},

A SaaS has to be configured or customized to suit the specific requirements of every enterprise that subscribes to it. IT service providers have to deal with the problem of testing many such configurations created for different enterprises. The software gets upgraded periodically and the configurations need to be tested on an ongoing basis to ensure business continuity. In order to run the testing organization efficiently, it is imperative that the test cycle is automated. Developing automated test scripts for a large number of configurations is a non-trivial task because differences across them may range from a few user interface changes to business process level changes. We propose an approach that combines the benefits of model driven engineering and variability modeling to address this issue. The approach comprises of the Enterprise Software Test Modeling Language to model the test cases. We use the Common Variability Language to model variability in the test cases and apply model transformations on a base model to generate a test model for each configuration. These models are used to generate automated test scripts for all the configurations. We describe the test modelling language and an experiment which shows that the approach can be used to automatically generate variations in automated test scripts.},

As the manual preparation of feature models is a tedious and labour-intensive activity, some techniques have been proposed to automatically generate boolean feature models from product descriptions. However, none of these techniques is capable of synthesizing feature attributes and relations among attributes, despite the huge relevance of attributes for documenting software product lines. In this paper, we introduce for the first time an algorithmic and parametrizable approach for computing a legal and appropriate hierarchy of features, including feature groups, typed feature attributes, domain values and relations among these attributes. We have performed an empirical evaluation by using both randomized configuration matrices and real-world examples. The initial results of our evaluation show that our approach can scale up to matrices containing 2,000 attributed features, and 200,000 distinct configurations in a couple of minutes.},

abstract = {Software products are rarely developed without providing different sets of features to better meet varying user needs, whether through tiered products as part of a product line or different subscription levels for software as a service (SaaS). Software product line approaches for generating and maintaining a family of different variants of software products address such needs for variation quite well. Real-world human-intensive systems (HISs) display similar needs for families of variants. A key contribution of this paper is to show how many of these needs can be rigorously and systematically addressed by adapting established techniques from system and software product line engineering (SPLE).In this paper, we present an approach for creating such families by explicitly modeling variation in HISs. We focus on two kinds of variation we have previously described in other work---functional detail variation and service variation. We describe a prototype system that is able to meet the need for these kinds of variation within an existing modeling framework and present a case study of the application of our prototype system to generate a family in an HIS from the domain of elections. Our approach also demonstrates how to perform model-checking of this family to discover whether any variants in the family may violate specified system requirements.},

abstract = {As the complexity and variety of systems and software products have increased, the ability to manage their variability effectively and efficiently became crucial. To this end, variability can be specified either as an integral part of the development artifacts or in a separate orthogonal variability model. Lately, orthogonal variability models attract a lot of attention due to the fact that they do not require changing the complexity of the development artifacts and can be used in conjunction with different development artifacts. Despite this attention and to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study examined the comprehensibility of orthogonal variability models.In this work, we conducted an exploratory experiment to examine potential comprehension problems in two common orthogonal variability modeling languages, namely, Common Variability Language (CVL) and Orthogonal Variability Model (OVM). We examined the comprehensibility of the variability models and their relations to the development artifacts for novice users. To measure comprehensibility we used comprehension score (i.e., percentage of correct solution), time spent to complete tasks, and participants' perception of difficulty of different model constructs. The results showed high comprehensibility of the variability models, but low comprehensibility of the relations between the variability models and the development artifacts. Although the comprehensibility of CVL and OVM was similar in terms of comprehension score and time spent to complete tasks, novice users perceived OVM as more difficult to comprehend.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a set of software systems that share a common and variable set of features. Software metrics provide basic means to quantify several modularity aspects of SPLs. However, the effectiveness of the SPL measurement process is directly dependent on the definition of reliable thresholds. If thresholds are not properly defined, it is difficult to actually know whether a given metric value indicates a potential problem in the feature implementation. There are several methods to derive thresholds for software metrics. However, there is little understanding about their appropriateness for the SPL context. This paper aims at comparing three methods to derive thresholds based on a benchmark of 33 SPLs. We assess to what extent these methods derive appropriate values for four metrics used in product-line engineering. These thresholds were used for guiding the identification of a typical anomaly found in features' implementation, named God Class. We also discuss the lessons learned on using such methods to derive thresholds for SPLs.},

abstract = {Feature models are a well-known concept to represent variability in software product lines by defining features and their dependencies. During feature-model evolution, for information hiding, and for feature-model analyses, it is often necessary to remove certain features from a model. As the crude deletion of features can have undesirable effects on their dependencies, dependency-preserving algorithms, known as feature-model slicing, have been proposed. However, current algorithms do not perform well when removing a high number of features from large feature models. Therefore, we propose an efficient algorithm for feature-model slicing based on logical resolution and the minimization of logical formulas. We empirically evaluate the scalability of our algorithm on a number of feature models and find that our algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms.},

abstract = {Features are commonly used to describe functional and nonfunctional aspects of software. To effectively evolve and reuse features, their location in software assets has to be known. However, locating features is often difficult given their crosscutting nature. Once implemented, the knowledge about a feature's location quickly deteriorates, requiring expensive recovering of these locations. Manually recording and maintaining traceability information is generally considered expensive and error-prone. In this paper, we argue to the contrary and hypothesize that such information can be effectively embedded into software assets, and that arising costs will be amortized by the benefits of this information later during development. We test this hypothesis in a study where we simulate the development of a product line of cloned/forked projects using a lightweight code annotation approach. We identify annotation evolution patterns and measure the cost and benefit of these annotations. Our results show that not only the cost of adding annotations, but also that of maintaining them is small compared to the actual development cost. Embedding the annotations into assets significantly reduced the maintenance cost because they naturally co-evolve with the assets. Our results also show that a majority of these annotations provides a benefit for feature-related code maintenance tasks, such as feature propagation and migrating clones into a platform.},

abstract = {Tool support that checks for configuration errors and generates product parts from configurations can significantly improve on product derivation in product line engineering. Up to now, however, derivation tools commonly disregard the staged derivation process. They do not restrict configuration consistency checks to process entities such as configuration stages, stakeholders, or build tasks. As a result, constraints that are only valid for certain process entities must either be checked permanently, leading to false positive errors, or one must refrain from defining them at all.This paper contributes a light-weight approach to provide tailored tool support for staged product derivation. Compared to previous approaches, it is not tied to a single configuration mechanism (e.g., feature modeling), and also accounts for the stakeholders involved and the build tasks that generate product parts. First, the product line engineer describes the derivation process in a concise model. Then, based on constraint checks on the configuration (e.g., a feature model configuration) that are linked to the modeled entities, comprehensive tool support can be provided: Configuration actions can be guided and restricted depending on the configuring stakeholder in a fine-grained manner, and constraints attached to a build task will only be checked if it actually shall be executed. Finally, in combination with previous work, the paper provides evidence that the approach is applicable to legacy product lines in a light-weight manner and that it technically scales to thousands of constraint checks.},

abstract = {Many companies offer a palette of similar software products though they do not necessarily have a Software Product Line (SPL). Rather, they start building and selling individual products which they then adapt, customize and extend for different customers. As the number of product variants increases, these companies then face the severe problem of having to maintain them all. Software Product Lines can be helpful here - not so much as a platform for creating new products but as a means of maintaining the existing ones with their shared features. Here, an important first step is to determine where features are implemented in the source code and in what product variants. To this end, this paper presents a novel technique for deriving the traceability between features and code in product variants by matching code overlaps and feature overlaps. This is a difficult problem because a feature's implementation not only covers its basic functionality (which does not change across product variants) but may include code that deals with feature interaction issues and thus changes depending on the combination of features present in a product variant. We empirically evaluated the approach on three non-trivial case studies of different sizes and domains and found that our approach correctly identifies feature to code traces except for code that traces to multiple disjunctive features, a rare case involving less than 1% of the code.},

abstract = {Context: It is important for Product Line Architectures (PLA) to remain stable accommodating evolutionary changes of stakeholder's requirements. Otherwise, architectural modifications may have to be propagated to products of a product line, thereby increasing maintenance costs. A key challenge is that several features are likely to exert a crosscutting impact on the PLA decomposition, thereby making it more difficult to preserve its stability in the presence of changes. Some researchers claim that the use of aspects can ameliorate instabilities caused by changes in crosscutting features. Hence, it is important to understand which aspect-oriented (AO) and non-aspect-oriented techniques better cope with PLA stability through evolution. Objective: This paper evaluates the positive and negative change impact of component and aspect based design on PLAs. The objective of the evaluation is to assess how aspects and components promote PLA stability in the presence of various types of evolutionary change. To support a broader analysis, we also evaluate the PLA stability of a hybrid approach (i.e. combined use of aspects and components) against the isolated use of component-based, OO, and AO approaches. Method: An quantitative and qualitative analysis of PLA stability which involved four different implementations of a PLA: (i) an OO implementation, (ii) an AO implementation, (iii) a component-based implementation, and (iv) a hybrid implementation where both components and aspects are employed. Each implementation has eight releases and they are functionally equivalent. We used conventional metrics suites for change impact and modularity to measure the architecture stability evaluation of the 4 implementations. Results: The combination of aspects and components promotes superior PLA resilience than the other PLAs in most of the circumstances. Conclusion: It is concluded that the combination of aspects and components supports the design of high cohesive and loosely coupled PLAs. It also contributes to improve modularity by untangling feature implementation.},

abstract = {A scalable approach for software product line testing is required due to the size and complexity of industrial product lines. In this paper, we present a specialized algorithm (called ICPL) for generating covering arrays from feature models. ICPL makes it possible to apply combinatorial interaction testing to software product lines of the size and complexity found in industry. For example, ICPL allows pair-wise testing to be readily applied to projects of about 7,000 features and 200,000 constraints, the Linux Kernel, one of the largest product lines where the feature model is available. ICPL is compared to three of the leading algorithms for t-wise covering array generation. Based on a corpus of 19 feature models, data was collected for each algorithm and feature model when the algorithm could finish 100 runs within three days. These data are used for comparing the four algorithms. In addition to supporting large feature models, ICPL is quick, produces small covering arrays and, even though it is non-deterministic, produces a covering array of a similar size within approximately the same time each time it is run with the same feature model.},

abstract = {Embedded software systems, e.g. automotive, robotic or automation systems are highly configurable and consist of many software components being available in different variants and versions. To identify the degree of reusability between these different occurrences of a component, it is necessary to determine the functional backward and forward compatibility between them. Based on this information it is possible to identify in which system context a component can be replaced safely by another version, e.g. exchanging an older component, or variant, e.g. introducing new features, to achieve the same functionality.This paper presents a model checking approach to determine behavioral compatibility of Simulink models, obtained from different component variants or during evolution. A prototype for automated compatibility checking demonstrates its feasibility. In addition implemented optimizations make the analysis more efficient, when the compared variants or versions are structurally similar.A case study on a driver assistance system provided by Daimler AG shows the effectiveness of the approach to automatically compare Simulink components.},

abstract = {Testing every member of a product line individually is often impracticable due to large number of possible product configurations. Thus, feature models are frequently used to generate samples, i.e., subsets of product configurations under test. Besides the extensively studied combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) approach for coverage-driven sample generation, only few approaches exist so far adopting mutation testing to emulate faults in feature models to be detected by a sample. In this paper, we present a mutation-based sampling framework for fault-based product-line testing. We define a comprehensive catalog of atomic mutation operators on the graphical representation of feature models. This way, we are able (1) to also define complex mutation operators emulating more subtle faults, and (2) to classify operators semantically, e.g., to avoid redundant and equivalent mutants. We further introduce similarity-based mutant selection and higher order mutation strategies to reduce testing efforts. Our implementation is based on the graph transformation engine Henshin and is evaluated concerning effectiveness/efficiency trade-offs.},

Designers often have two or more alternatives, which must be compared and put into context before a decision is made. The challenge becomes even more complex for dynamic software product lines, where domain designers have to take runtime variations into consideration as well. To address the problem we propose extensions to an architectural reasoning framework with constructs/artifacts to define and model a domain's scope and dynamic variability. The extended reasoning framework encapsulates knowledge to understand and reason about domain quality behavior and self-adaptation as a primary variability mechanism. The framework is demonstrated for a self-configuration property, self-upgradability on an educational product-line.},

The simulation is controlled by a feedback loop and a reasoning engine that operates on the functional and non-functional requirements. The paper contribution is threefold. First, REFAS allows developers to evaluate and improve requirements models through their simulation capabilities. Second, REFAS provides rich feedback in its interactive simulations for the human modeller to make informed decisions to improve her model. Third, REFAS automates the generation of simulation scenarios required to verify the model adequacy and correctness. We evaluate our contribution by comparing the application of REFAS to a case study used in other approaches.},

abstract = {Industrial product lines are typically maintained for a long time and evolve continuously to address changing requirements and new technologies. Already derived products often have to be re-derived after such changes to benefit from new and updated features. Product line engineers thus frequently need to analyze the impact of changes to variability models to prevent unexpected changes of re-derived products. In this paper we present a tool-supported approach that informs engineers about the impacts of variability model changes on existing products. Regression tests are used to determine whether existing product configurations and generated product outputs can be re-derived without unexpected effects. We evaluate the feasibility of the approach based on changes observed in a real-world software product line. More specifically, we show how our approach helps engineers performing specific evolution tasks to analyze the change impacts on existing products. We also evaluate the performance and scalability of our approach. Our results show that variability change impact analyses can be automated using model regression testing and can help reducing the gap between domain engineering and application engineering.},

Microservice architecture is widely used to overcome the limitations of monolithic legacy systems, such as limited maintainability and reusability. Migration to a microservice architecture is increasingly becoming the focus of academic research. However, there is little knowledge on how microservices are extracted from legacy systems in practice. Among these limitations, there is a lack of understanding if variability is considered useful along the microservice extraction from a configurable system. In order to address this gap, we performed an exploratory study composed of two phases. Firstly, we conducted an online survey with 26 specialists that contributed to the migration of existing systems to a microservice architecture. Secondly, we performed individual interviews with seven survey participants. A subset of the participants (13 out of 26) dealt with systems with variability during the extraction, which stated that variability is a key criterion for structuring the microservices. Moreover, variability in the legacy system is usually implemented with simple mechanisms. Finally, initial evidence points out that microservices extraction can increase software customization.},

Example successful ecosystems include iOS apps, Photoshop Lightroom plug-ins, RESTful web services, and numerous e-commerce systems. This talk will examine the critical role that architectural styles play in making and sustaining successful ecosystems. Architectural styles are sets of design decisions applicable to a particular context, constraining development within that context, and yielding beneficial qualities. Styles carry lessons learned through experience, aid communication, provide vocabulary, and speed design. Most importantly, they can be key elements in maintaining conceptual integrity. After examining the role of styles in several ecosystems, the talk will focus on the particular problems of ecosystems in which some participants may be malicious, or where high degrees of customization or adaptability are required.},

abstract = {Variable Data Printing solutions provide means to generate documents whose content varies according to some criteria. Since the early Mail Merge-like applications that generated letters with destination data taken from databases, different languages and frameworks have been developed with increasing levels of sophistication. Current tools allow the generation of highly customized documents that are variable not only in content, but also in layout. However, most frameworks are technology-oriented, and their use requires high skills in implementation-related tools (XML, XPATH, and others), which do not include support for domain-related tasks like identification of document content variability.In this paper, we introduce DPLfw, a framework for variable content document generation based on Software Product Line Engineering principles. It is an implementation of the Document Product Lines (DPL) approach, which was defined with the aim of supporting variable content document generation from a domain-oriented point of view. DPL models document content variability in terms of features, and product line-like processes support the generation of documents. We define the DPLfw architecture, and illustrate its use in the definition of variable-content emergency plans.},

abstract = {Product lines are usually built for the long term in order to repay the initial investment. While long-term stable software systems are already hard, if they are developed individually, it is even harder for complete product lines. At the time a new product line is created, the details of future product line characteristics are typically not known, no matter how well and detailed scoping and planning is done. Thus, any product line needs to evolve and adapt over time to incorporate new customer requirements as well as new technology constraints.Stability of the product line architecture is very important to the successful long-term evolution of a product line. In this paper, we discuss how a form of domain decomposition, which we call conceptual architecture, can be used to guide product line engineering towards long-term viability. We will illustrate this approach in the context of a large-scale product line development and analyze the evolution properties of the product line. Transferability of the approach is suggested to other embedded software systems that drive mature, well-understood physical control system.},

abstract = {Customizing web services according to users' individual functional and non-functional requirements has become increasingly difficult as the number of users increases. This paper introduces a new way to customize and verify composite web services by incorporating a software product-line engineering approach into web-service composition. The approach uses a partitioning similar to that between domain engineering and application engineering in the product-line context. It specifies the options that the user can select and constructs the resulting web-service compositions. By first creating a web-service composition search space that satisfies the common requirements and then querying the search space as the user selects values for the parameters of variation, we provide a more efficient way to customize web services. A decision model, illustrated with examples from an emergency-response application, is created to interact with the customers and ensure the consistency of their specifications. The capability to reuse the composition search space may also help improve the quality and reliability of the composite services and reduce the cost of re-verifying the same compositions.},

abstract = {Scoping can be defined as the process of deciding in which parts of an organization's products, features and domains systematic reuse is economically useful. It generally is the first phase in product line engineering. For a decade now scoping has been recognized as a discipline of it's own in product line engineering. So it's time to look at what has been done in scoping in the last years and what is still to be done. In this survey, we identify and characterize existing scoping approaches with the main goal to derive open areas and research questions for further research in scoping. We analyze and compare existing approaches and derive open and partially addressed research questions that can be tackled by researchers in product line engineering in the next years.},

abstract = {Application engineers frequently create customer-specific products in two stages: the required software components are first selected to create an initial product which is then evolved by refining the selected features and adapting the code to meet the customers' requirements. For instance, developers frequently set configuration options in the code to adjust the product. However, given that such changes are often necessary in the entire code base it is hard to know which part of the code is still relevant for the chosen configuration options. This means that engineers need to understand and maintain a lot of code that is potentially inactive in a particular product variant. Existing approaches provide only partial solutions: for instance, feature-to-code mappings do not adequately consider complex code dependencies of the implemented features. Static analysis techniques provide better results but usually do not consider variability aspects. We present an approach to automatically identify inactive code in product variants using a configuration-aware code analysis technique. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by customizing it to a product line of an industry partner in the domain of industrial automation. We further evaluate the approach to demonstrate its effectiveness, accuracy, and performance.},

abstract = {Software variability management deals with the adaptation of reusable artifacts, such as models, specifications, and code, for particular requirements. External variability, which refers to software functionality as visible to users, deserves a special attention as it is closely linked to requirements and hence to early development stages. Errors or inaccuracies in these stages are relatively inexpensive to detect and easy to correct, yet can lead to expensive outcomes if not corrected. Nevertheless, the analysis of external variability in the literature is done ad-hoc and requires improvement.In this paper we introduce a framework for classifying external variability types based on ontological principles. The framework defines the external view of software in terms of the behavior of the application domain. Behavior is formalized as state changes in response to external stimuli. Based on this view we classify the possible similarities and differences among applications and identify an integrated similarity measurement. We demonstrate the usage of this classification framework for feasibility studies in system development.},

abstract = {Modern conflict-driven clause-learning (CDCL) Boolean SAT solvers provide efficient automatic analysis of real-world feature models (FM) of systems ranging from cars to operating systems. It is well-known that solver-based analysis of real-world FMs scale very well even though SAT instances obtained from such FMs are large, and the corresponding analysis problems are known to be NP-complete. To better understand why SAT solvers are so effective, we systematically studied many syntactic and semantic characteristics of a representative set of large real-world FMs. We discovered that a key reason why large real-world FMs are easy-to-analyze is that the vast majority of the variables in these models are unrestricted, i.e., the models are satisfiable for both true and false assignments to such variables under the current partial assignment. Given this discovery and our understanding of CDCL SAT solvers, we show that solvers can easily find satisfying assignments for such models without too many backtracks relative to the model size, explaining why solvers scale so well. Further analysis showed that the presence of unrestricted variables in these real-world models can be attributed to their high-degree of variability. Additionally, we experimented with a series of well-known nonbacktracking simplifications that are particularly effective in solving FMs. The remaining variables/clauses after simplifications, called the core, are so few that they are easily solved even with backtracking, further strengthening our conclusions. We explain the connection between our findings and backdoors, an idea posited by theorists to explain the power of SAT solvers. This connection strengthens our hypothesis that SAT-based analysis of FMs is easy. In contrast to our findings, previous research characterizes the difficulty of analyzing randomly-generated FMs in terms of treewidth. Our experiments suggest that the difficulty of analyzing real-world FMs cannot be explained in terms of treewidth.},

However, some studies point to the viability of using this approach to develop Assistive Technology software. Through this approach, important limiting factors to use Assistive Technologies can be overcome. These factors are related to the acquisition costs and difficulty to find products corresponding to specific and varying user needs. Considering that Software Product Line approach provides mass customization of software products, the specific needs of each user can be more easily satisfied by software developers. Furthermore, the reuse of code artifacts to development provides a fall in the acquisition cost of these software products. We present in this paper a literature review that aims to investigate how this approach has been applied to the development of Assistive Technology software. Also, we present some quality factors that should be considered to develop Assistive Technologies using Software Product Lines. Thus, the main findings of the review are grouped in order to find the main gaps to be explored in future work.},

abstract = {Feature models are often used to describe variability and commonality in Software Product Lines, specifying admissible configurations of valid products. However, invalid configurations may arise in some scenarios. These include feature model evolution that invalidates pre-existing products or collaborative configuration by multiple stakeholders with conflicting goals, among others. This problem has been acknowledged in the literature and some techniques for configuration repair have already been proposed. However, common optimization criteria such as proximity between original and repaired configurations can result in a significant number of alternative repair possibilities, easily attaining thousands of alternatives for models of practical dimension. Consequently, rather than just efficiently providing an exhaustive list of possibilities, an approach that specifically addresses this issue should be able to offer the user a manageable and comprehensible view of the configuration problems and potential repair options. We offer a novel approach for configuration repair, based on partitioning and cover analysis, with high performance and generating high quality solutions, which allows efficient identification and presentation of multiple competing repairs.},

abstract = {Software Products Lines (SPLs) are families of products sharing common assets representing code or functionalities of a software product. These assets are represented as features, usually organized into Feature Models (FMs) from which the user can configure software products. Generally, few features are sufficient to allow configuring millions of software products. As a result, selecting the products matching given testing objectives is a difficult problem.The testing process usually involves multiple and potentially conflicting testing objectives to fulfill, e.g. maximizing the number of optional features to test while at the same time both minimizing the number of products and minimizing the cost of testing them. However, most approaches for generating products usually target a single objective, like testing the maximum amount of feature interactions. While focusing on one objective may be sufficient in certain cases, this practice does not reflect real-life testing situations.The present paper proposes a genetic algorithm to handle multiple conflicting objectives in test generation for SPLs. Experiments conducted on FMs of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness, feasibility and practicality of the introduced approach.},

abstract = {The large variety of computerized solutions (software and information systems) calls for a systematic approach to their comparison and evaluation. Different methods have been proposed over the years for analyzing the similarity and variability of systems. These methods get artifacts, such as requirements, design models, or code, of different systems (commonly in the same domain), identify and calculate their similarities, and represent the variability in models, such as feature diagrams. Most methods rely on implementation considerations of the input systems and generate outcomes based on predefined, fixed strategies of comparison (referred to as variability views). In this paper, we introduce an approach for mining relevant views for comparison and evaluation, based on the input artifacts. Particularly, we equip SOVA – a Semantic and Ontological Variability Analysis method – with data mining techniques in order to identify relevant views that highlight variability or similarity of the input artifacts (natural language requirement documents). The comparison is done using entropy and Rand index measures. The method and its outcomes are evaluated on a case of three photo sharing applications.},

abstract = {Changing markets and environments has made the ability to rapidly adapt to these changes a necessity in software systems. However the costs of changing and adapting systems to new requirements still remains an unsolved issue. In this context service-oriented software product lines were introduced with the aim to combine the reusability of software product line with the flexibility of service-oriented architecture. Although this approach helps build flexible software systems with high levels of reuse, certain issues are raised. The main issue is the complexity that a service-oriented product line will face. Developing systems from internal and external assets, taking into consideration the variety and number of these assets, can cause problems in deciding which asset is best suited for the system. To help solve these issues we propose the use of approaches based on artificial intelligence. In this paper we show how swarm intelligence can be used in service-oriented product lines to reduce complexity and find optimal solutions for the development of software systems. We also present an example of the application of swarm intelligence in finding the optimal product for a service-oriented product line.},

abstract = {Software Product-Line (SPL) model checking has reached an adequate level of efficiency and expressiveness to be applied on real-world cases. Yet a major challenge remains: model checkers should consist of black-box tools that do not require in-depth expertise to be used. In particular, it is essential to provide engineers with easy-to-learn languages to model both the behaviour of their SPL and the properties to check. In this paper, we propose a framework to build customized product-line verifiers modularly. Our extensible architecture allows one to plug new modelling languages or verifications algorithms without modifying other parts of it. It also provides means of representing and reasoning on variability that can facilitate the development of other SPL quality assurance techniques. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by detailing how we created a new domain-specific SPL modelling language and linked it to our tool.},

In this light, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) provide a way to build self-managing systems exploiting traditional product line engineering concepts at runtime. Although context-awareness is widely perceived to be a first-class concern in such runtime variability mechanisms, existing approaches do not provide the necessary level of formalization to model and enact context variability for DSPLs. This is crucial for operational analytics processes since variant configuration could differ from context to context depending on diverse data values linked to context features and cross-tree constraints in a feature model. In this paper, we propose a context variability modeling approach, demonstrate its applicability and usability via a wind farm use case, and present the fundamental building blocks of a framework for enabling context variability in service-based DSPLs which provide Workflow as a Service (WFaaS).},

abstract = {Successful software products evolve continuously to meet the changing stakeholder requirements. For software product lines, an additional challenge is that variabilities, characteristics that vary among products, change as well over time. That challenge must be carefully tackled during the evolution of the product line infrastructure. This is a significant problem for many software development organizations, as practical guidelines on how to evolve core assets, and especially source code, are missing.This paper investigates how to achieve "good enough" variability management during the evolution of variation in software design and implementation assets. As a first contribution, we present a customizable goal-based approach which helps to identify improvement potential in existing core assets to ease evolution. To find concrete ways to improve the product line infrastructure, we list the typical symptoms of variability "code smells" and show how to refine them to root causes, questions, and finally to metrics that can be extracted from large code bases.As a second main contribution, we show how this method was applied to evaluate the reuse quality of three industrial embedded systems. These systems are implemented in C or C++ and use Conditional Compilation as the main variability mechanism. We also introduce the analysis and refactoring tool set that was used in the case studies and discuss the lessons learnt.},

Automatic code generation also contributed to those improvements.},

abstract = {In Software Product Line (SPL) engineering one uses Variability Models (VMs) as input to automated reasoners to generate optimal products according to certain Quality Attributes (QAs). Variability models, however, and more specifically those including numerical features (i.e., NVMs), do not natively support QAs, and consequently, neither do automated reasoners commonly used for variability resolution. However, those satisfiability and optimisation problems have been covered and refined in other relational models such as databases.Category Theory (CT) is an abstract mathematical theory typically used to capture the common aspects of seemingly dissimilar algebraic structures. We propose a unified relational modelling framework subsuming the structured objects of VMs and QAs and their relationships into algebraic categories. This abstraction allows a combination of automated reasoners over different domains to analyse SPLs. The solutions’ optimisation can now be natively performed by a combination of automated theorem proving, hashing, balanced-trees and chasing algorithms. We validate this approach by means of the edge computing SPL tool HADAS.},

abstract = {Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted HighlightsWe propose to combine IBEA and DE for the optimal feature selection in SPLE.We propose a feedback-directed method into EAs to improve the correctness of results.Our IBED with the seeding method has significantly shortened the search time.In most cases, IBED finds more unique and non-dominated solutions than IBEA. Software configuration, which aims to customize the software for different users (e.g., Linux kernel configuration), is an important and complicated task. In software product line engineering (SPLE), feature oriented domain analysis is adopted and feature model is used to guide the configuration of new product variants. In SPLE, product configuration is an optimal feature selection problem, which needs to find a set of features that have no conflicts and meanwhile achieve multiple design objectives (e.g., minimizing cost and maximizing the number of features). In previous studies, several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were used for the optimal feature selection problem and indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) was proven to be the best MOEA for this problem. However, IBEA still suffers from the issues of correctness and diversity of found solutions. In this paper, we propose a dual-population evolutionary algorithm, named IBED, to achieve both correctness and diversity of solutions. In IBED, two populations are individually evolved with two different types of evolutionary operators, i.e., IBEA operators and differential evolution (DE) operators. Furthermore, we propose two enhancement techniques for existing MOEAs, namely the feedback-directed mechanism to fast find the correct solutions (e.g., solutions that satisfy the feature model constraints) and the preprocessing method to reduce the search space. Our empirical results have shown that IBED with the enhancement techniques can outperform several state-of-the-art MOEAs on most case studies in terms of correctness and diversity of found solutions.},

abstract = {The evolution of computer technology has strongly impacted the database design. No phase was spared: several conceptual formalisms e.g. ER, UML, ontological, various logical models e.g. relational, object, key-value, a wide panoply of physical optimization structures and deployment platforms have been proposed. As a result, the database design process has become more complex involving more tasks and even more actors as database architect or analyst. Getting inspired from software engineering in dealing with variable similar systems, we propose a methodological framework for a variability-aware design of databases, whereby this latter is henceforth devised as a Software Product Line. Doing so guarantees a high reuse, automation, and customizability in generating ready-to-be implemented databases. We also propose a solution to help users make a suitable choice among the wide panoply. Finally, a case study is presented.},

abstract = {The testing of scientific frameworks is a challenging task. The special characteristics of scientific software e.g. missing test oracle, the need for high performance parallel computing, and high priority of non-functional requirements, need to be accounted for as well as the large variability in a framework. In our previous research, we have shown how software product line engineering can be applied to support the testing of scientific frameworks. We developed a process for handling the variability of a framework using software product line (SPL) variability modeling. From the variability models, we derive test applications and use them for system tests for the framework. In this paper we examine the overall quality assurance for a scientific framework. First, we propose a SPL test strategy for scientific frameworks called Variable test Application strategy for Frameworks (VAF). This test strategy tests both, commonality and variability, of the framework and supports the framework's users in testing their applications by creating reusable test artifacts. We operationalize VAF with test activities that are combined with other quality assurance activities to form the design of a quality assurance process for scientific frameworks. We introduce a list of special characteristics for scientific software that we use as rationale for the design of this process.},

Various works have addressed edits to fms for fm evolution and tool support to ensure consistency of fms. An important extension to fms are feature cardinalities and related constraints, as extensively used e.g., when modeling variability of cloud computing environments. Since cardinality-based fms pose additional complexity, additional support for evolution and consistency checking with respect to feature cardinalities would be desirable, but has not been addressed yet. In this paper, we discuss common cardinality-based fm edits and resulting inconsistencies based on experiences with fms in cloud domain. We introduce tool-support for automated inconsistency detection and explanation based on an off-the-shelf solver. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by an empirical evaluation showing the performance of the tool.},

abstract = {Abstract Delta Modeling (ADM) offers an algebraic description of how a (software) product line may be built so that every product can be automatically derived by structured reuse of code. In traditional application engineering a single valid feature configuration is chosen, which does not change during the lifetime of the product. However, there are many useful applications for product lines that change their configuration at run time. We present a new technique for generating efficient dynamic product lines from their static counterparts. We use Mealy machines for their dynamic reconfiguration. Furthermore, we posit that monitoring some features will be more expensive than monitoring others, and present techniques for minimizing the cost of monitoring the system. We stay in the abstract setting of ADM but the techniques can be instantiated to any concrete domain. We illustrate them through the example of a mobile application for Android, which dynamically reconfigures a devices operating profile based on environmental factors.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) requires the construction of feature models from large, unstructured and heterogeneous documents, and the reliable derivation of product variants from the resulting model. This can be an arduous task when performed manually, and can be error-prone in the presence of a change in requirements. In this paper we introduce a tool suite which automatically processes natural-language requirements documents into a candidate feature model, which can be refined by the requirements engineer. The framework also guides the process of identifying variant concerns and their composition with other features. We also provide language support for specifying semantic variant feature compositions which are resilient to change. We show that feature models produced by this framework compare favourably with those produced by domain experts by application to a real-life industrial example.},

During their development several engineers of different disciplines are involved, such as mechanical, electrical and software engineering. Each engineer focuses on specific system aspects to be developed. To enable an efficient development, product lines especially with feature models for variability modeling are promising technologies. In order to reduce the complexity of both feature models and development process, views on feature models can be applied. The use of views for filtering purposes constitutes an established method. However, views also enable further options missing in current approaches, such as evaluations regarding requirements, including non-functional ones. This paper presents an approach for evaluation across multiple views to enable collaborative development for developers who focus on different system aspects. We validate our approach by applying it in an industrial project for the planning of flying saws.},

abstract = {Software ecosystems is an emerging trend within the software industry, implying a shift from closed organizations and processes towards open structures, where actors external to the software development organization are becoming increasingly involved in development. This forms an ecosystem of organizations that are related through the shared interest in a software product, leading to new opportunities and new challenges to the industry and its organizational environment. To understand why and how this change occurs, we have followed the development of a software product line organization for a period of approximately five years. We have studied their change from a waterfall-like approach, via agile software product line engineering, towards an emerging software ecosystem. We discuss implications for practice, and propose a nascent theory on software ecosystems. We conclude that the observed change has led to an increase in collaboration across (previously closed) organizational borders, and to the development of a shared value consisting of two components: the technology (the product line, as an extensible platform), and the business domain it supports. Opening up both the technical interface of the product and the organizational interfaces are key enablers of such a change.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineering allows the derivation of products tailored to stakeholders’ needs through the setting of a large number of configuration options. Unfortunately, options and their interactions create a huge configuration space which is either intractable or too costly to explore exhaustively. Instead of covering all products, machine learning (ML) approximates the set of acceptable products (e.g., successful builds, passing tests) out of a training set (a sample of configurations). However, ML techniques can make prediction errors yielding non-acceptable products wasting time, energy and other resources. We apply adversarial machine learning techniques to the world of SPLs and craft new configurations faking to be acceptable configurations but that are not and vice-versa. It allows to diagnose prediction errors and take appropriate actions. We develop two adversarial configuration generators on top of state-of-the-art attack algorithms and capable of synthesizing configurations that are both adversarial and conform to logical constraints. We empirically assess our generators within two case studies: an industrial video synthesizer (MOTIV) and an industry-strength, open-source Web-app configurator (JHipster). For the two cases, our attacks yield (up to) a 100% misclassification rate without sacrificing the logical validity of adversarial configurations. This work lays the foundations of a quality assurance framework for ML-based SPLs.},

To realize these benefits, it employs systematic variability management and proactive planning and engineering for reuse which to a significant extent require prescribing features, variants, etc. In an environment of increasingly demanding customers and ongoing pressure on costs, time, and quality, the risk increases that the necessary changes compromise the product line's envisioned structure and benefits. Innovating and flexibly adapting a product line to changing needs is thus highly challenging. Organizations are faced with a bulk of innovation approaches, models, success factors, etc. while the key challenge remains to establish an innovation management system tailored to an organization's specific needs.

abstract = {Efficient configuration management system is crucial for the success of any software product line (SPL). Due to ever changing needs of customers, SPL undergoes constant changes that are to be tracked in real time. In the context of customer-driven development, anticipation and change management are to be given paramount importance. It demands implementation of software variability that drives home changed, extended and customized configurations besides economy at scale. Moreover, the emergence of distributed technologies, the unprecedented growth of component based, serviceoriented systems throw ever increasing challenges to software product line configuration management. Derivation of a new product is a dynamic process in software product line that should consider functionality and quality attributes. Very few approaches are found on configuration management (CM) of SPL though CM is enough matured for traditional products. They are tailor made and inadequate to provide a general solution. Stated differently, a comprehensive approach for SPL configuration management and product derivation is still to be desired. In this paper, we proposed a framework that guides in doing so besides helping in SPL definitions in generic way. Our framework facilitates SPL configuration management and product derivation based on critical path analysis, weight computation and feedback. We proposed two algorithms namely Quality Driven Product Derivation (QDPD) and Composition Analysis algorithm for generating satisfied compositions and to find best possible composition respectively. The usage of weights and critical path analysis improves quality of product derivation. The framework is extensible and flexible thus it can be leveraged with variability-aware design patterns and ontology. We built a prototype that demonstrates the proof of concept. We tested our approach with Dr. School product line. The results reveal that the framework supports configuration management of SPL and derivation of high quality product in the product line. We evaluated results with ground truth to establish significance of our implementation},

Hence, the PLA design is an optimization problem and problems like that have been successfully solved in the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) area, by using metaheuristics such as Genetic Algorithm. Considering this fact, this paper introduces a tool named OPLA-Tool, conceived to provide computer support to a search-based approach for PLA design. OPLA-Tool implements all the steps necessary to use multi-objective optimization algorithms, including PLA transformations and visualization through a graphical interface. OPLA-Tool receives as input a PLA at the class diagram level, and produces a set of good alternative diagrams in terms of cohesion, feature modularization and reduction of crosscutting concerns.},

For software product lines, modifying variability is an additional challenge that must be carefully tackled during the evolution of the product line. This bears considerable challenges for industry as understanding on how variability realizations advance over time is not trivial. Moreover, it may lead to an erosion of variability, which needs an investigation of techniques on how to identify the variability erosion in practice, especially in the source code. To address various erosion symptoms, we have investigated the evolution of a large-scale industrial product line over a period of four years. Along improvement goals, we have researched a set of appropriate metrics and measurement approaches in a goal-oriented way, applied them in this case study with tool support, and interpreted the results including identified erosion symptoms.},

Over the years, their application has also been extended to assist stakeholders in the configuration of software products. However, existing feature-based configuration techniques offer little support for tailoring configuration views to the profiles of the various stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, yet formal and flexible, mechanism to leverage multidimensional separation of concerns in feature-based configuration. We propose a technique to specify concerns in feature diagrams and to generate automatically concern-specific configuration views. Three alternative visualisations are proposed.

abstract = {A Software Product Line (SPL) is a set of products built from a number of features, the set of valid products being defined by a feature model. Typically, it does not make sense to test all products defined by an SPL and one instead chooses a set of products to test (test selection) and, ideally, derives a good order in which to test them (test prioritisation). Since one cannot know in advance which products will reveal faults, test selection and prioritisation are normally based on objective functions that are known to relate to likely effectiveness or cost. This article introduces a new technique, the grid-based evolution strategy (GrES), which considers several objective functions that assess a selection or prioritisation and aims to optimise on all of these. The problem is thus a many-objective optimisation problem. We use a new approach, in which all of the objective functions are considered but one (pairwise coverage) is seen as the most important. We also derive a novel evolution strategy based on domain knowledge. The results of the evaluation, on randomly generated and realistic feature models, were promising, with GrES outperforming previously proposed techniques and a range of many-objective optimisation algorithms.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is a process for identifying the common and variable parts of a software product line and recording them in a tree-structured feature model. However, feature models can be difficult for mainstream developers to specify and maintain because most tools rely on specialized theories, notations, or technologies. To address this issue, we propose a design that uses mainstream JSON-related technologies to encode and manipulate feature models and then uses the models to generate Web forms for product configuration. This JSON-based design can form part of a comprehensive, interactive environment that enables mainstream developers to specify, store, update, and exchange feature models and use them to configure members of product families.},

abstract = {Business calculations like break-even, return on investment, or cost are essential in many domains to support decision making while configuring products. For instance, customers and sales people need to estimate and compare the business value of different product variants. Some product line approaches provide initial support, e.g., by defining quality attributes in relation to features. However, an approach that allows domain engineers to easily define business calculations together with variability models is still lacking. In product configuration, calculation results need to be instantly presented to end users after making configuration choices. Further, due to the often high number of calculations, the presentation of calculation results to end users can be challenging. These challenges cannot be addressed by integrating off-the-shelf applications performing the calculations with product line tools. We thus present an approach based on dedicated calculation models that are related to variability models. Our approach seamlessly integrates business calculations with product configuration and provides support for formatting calculations and calculation results. We use the DOPLER tool suite to deploy calculations together with variability models to end users in product configuration. We evaluate the expressiveness and practical relevance of the approach by investigating the development of business calculations for 15 product lines from the domain of industrial automation.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines Engineering is the area of software engineering that aims to systematise the modelling, creation and improvement of groups of interconnected software systems by formally expressing possible alternative products in the form of Feature Models. Deriving a software product/system from a feature model is called Feature Configuration. Engineers select the subset of features (software components) from a feature model that suits their needs, while respecting the underlying relationships/constraints of the system–which is challenging on its own. Since there exist several (and often antagonistic) perspectives on which the quality of software could be assessed, the problem is even more challenging as it becomes a multi-objective optimisation problem. Current multi-objective feature selection in software product line approaches (e.g., SATIBEA) combine the scalability of a genetic algorithm (IBEA) with a solution reparation approach based on a SAT solver or one of its derivatives. In this paper, we propose MILPIBEA, a novel hybrid algorithm which combines IBEA with the accuracy of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reparation. We show that the MILP reparation modifies fewer features from the original infeasible solutions than the SAT reparation and in a shorter time. We also demonstrate that MILPIBEA outperforms SATIBEA on average on various multi-objective performance metrics, especially on the largest feature models. The other major challenge in software engineering in general and in software product lines, in particular, is evolution. While the change in software components is common in the software engineering industry, the particular case of multi-objective optimisation of evolving software product lines is not well-tackled yet. We show that MILPIBEA is not only able to better take advantage of the evolution than SATIBEA, but it is also the one that continues to improve the quality of the solutions when SATIBEA stagnates. Overall, IBEA performs better when combined with MILP instead of SAT reparation when optimising the multi-objective feature selection in large and evolving software product lines.},

As solution, researchers suggest family-based verification approaches, which either transform compile-time into runtime variability or make verification tools variability-aware. Existing approaches either focus on theorem proving, model checking, or other verification techniques. For the first time, we combine theorem proving and model checking to evaluate their synergies for product-line verification. We provide tool support by connecting five existing tools, namely FeatureIDE and FeatureHouse for product-line development, as well as KeY, JPF, and OpenJML for verification of Java programs. In an experiment, we found the synergy of improved effectiveness and efficiency, especially for product lines with few defects. Further, we experienced that model checking and theorem proving are more efficient and effective if the product line contains more defects.},

abstract = {Building a software product line (SPL) is a systematic strategy for reusing software within a family of related systems from some application domain. To define an SPL, domain analysts must identify the common and variable aspects of systems in the family and capture this information so that it can be used effectively to construct specific products. Often analysts record this information using a feature model expressed visually as a feature diagram. The overall goal of this project is to enable wider use of SPLs by identifying relevant concepts, defining systematic methods, and developing practical tools that leverage familiar web programming technologies. This paper presents a novel approach to specification of feature models: capture the details using automatically generated user interfaces, encode the models in a relational database, and then validate the models and construct specific products using SQL.},

This activity gets even more complicated when it involves multiple stakeholders in the configuration process. Research work has proposed approaches to aid multi-stakeholder feature model configuration, but they rely on systematic processes that constraint decisions of some of the stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the multi-stakeholder configuration process, considering stakeholders' preferences expressed through both hard and soft constraints. Based on such preferences, we recommend different product configurations using different strategies from the social choice theory. We conducted an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies with respect to individual stakeholder satisfaction and fairness among all stakeholders. Results indicate that particular strategies perform best with respect to these aspects.},

abstract = {In current software systems with highly volatile requirements, traceability plays a key role to maintain the consistency between requirements and code. Traceability between artifacts involved in the development of software product line (SPL) is still more critical because it is necessary to guarantee that the selection of variants that realize the different SPL products meet the requirements. Current SPL traceability mechanisms trace from variability in features to variations in the configuration of product-line architecture (PLA) in terms of adding and removing components. However, it is not always possible to materialize the variable features of a SPL through adding or removing components, since sometimes they are materialized inside components, i.e., in part of their functionality: a class, a service, and/or an interface. Additionally, variations that happen inside components may crosscut several components of architecture. These kinds of variations are still challenging and their traceability is not currently well supported. Therefore, it is not possible to guarantee that those SPL products with these kinds of variations meet the requirements. This paper presents a solution for tracing variability from features to PLA by taking these kinds of variations into account. This solution is based on models and traceability between models in order to automate SPL configuration by selecting the variants and realizing the product application. The FPLA modeling framework supports this solution which has been deployed in a software factory. Validation has consisted in putting the solution into practice to develop a product line of power metering management applications for smart grids.},

One software reuse approach is to develop a Software Product-line (SPL), which is a reconfigurable software architecture that can be reused across projects. Creating configurations of the SPL that meets arbitrary requirements is hard.Existing research has focused on techniques that produce a configuration of the SPL in a single step. This paper provides three contributions to the study of multi-step configuration for SPLs. First, we present a formal model of multi-step SPL configuration and map this model to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Second, we show how solutions to these CSP configuration problem CSPs can be derived automatically with a constraint solver. Third, we present empirical results demonstrating that our CSP-based technique can solve multi-step configuration problems involving hundreds of features in seconds.},

abstract = {Software product lines have potential to allow for mass customization of products. Unfortunately, the resulting, vast amount of possible product variants with commonalities and differences leads to new challenges in software testing. Ideally, every product variant should be tested, especially in safety-critical systems. However, due to the exponentially increasing number of product variants, testing every product variant is not feasible. Thus, new concepts and techniques are required to provide efficient SPL testing strategies exploiting the commonalities of software artifacts between product variants to reduce redundancy in testing. In this paper, we present an efficient integration testing approach for SPLs based on delta modeling. We focus on test case prioritization. As a result, only the most important test cases for every product variant are tested, reducing the number of executed test cases significantly, as testing can stop at any given point because of resource constraints while ensuring that the most important test cases have been covered. We present the general concept and our evaluation results. The results show a measurable reduction of executed test cases compared to single-software testing approaches.},

abstract = {At the beginning, creating a product line needs a well defined and narrow scope to meet short time to market demands. When established, there is a tendency to broaden the scope and to cover more domains and products.We have undergone a scope extension of our medical diagnostic platform that was implemented while the platform and (existing) products were evolving. In this paper, we list best practices for the migration process and how to come to a sustainable solution without cannibalizing the existing platform and products.In particular, we describe our way of identification beneficial sub-domains using C/V analysis and give an example scenario with alignments in order to increase commonality. We explain the maturity considerations for deciding on reuse of existing implementations and a carve-out strategy to split existing assets into common modules and product-line specific extensions. Furthermore, we describe our best practices for making the scope extension sustainable in a long term, using various types of governance means. We briefly complement these experiences with further insights gained during execution of this endeavor.},

abstract = {Model checking provides a convenient way to check whether a given software system is correct with respect to a set of relevant semantic properties. To use a model checker like SPIN [5], the software system must be modelled as a transition system (TS). Afterwards, the model checker can check the correctness of the translated TS by exhaustively exploring all possible transitions.For families of software systems Classen et al. [1] present a lifted model checker SNIP, where each family is modelled as a Featured TS [2] that has transitions guarded by feature expressions. SNIP is highly specialized and uses heuristics to avoid na\"{\i}vely iterating through all possible variations; however, the number of configurations is still exponential in size and thus the model checker can only feasibly handle systems of a limited size.We adapt our previous work on applying variability abstraction to lifted data-flow analysis [3] to the setting of lifted model checking. We present a calculus of variability abstractions that trade precision for speed while preserving correctness [4]. The abstractions work symbiotically with the lifted model checker SNIP, but can also work with the classical and efficient off-the-shelf model checker SPIN without requiring any knowledge of variability. We prove semantically how each abstraction operation in the calculus forms a Galois collection, and therefore is suitable to use in abstract interpretation of Featured TS. Furthermore, we present an equivalent lightweight syntactic transformation tool that works directly on the input text files and does not require explicitly constructing the corresponding Featured TS in memory.Our results show that there are orders of magnitudes to be gained in performance compared to performing lifted analysis alone; we show how our tool scales better than the existing tools and makes analysing some previously infeasible models feasible. Furthermore, we also show that many models could be verified swiftly using the abstracted analysis without requiring all of the precision that a concrete analysis provides.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a rising interest in cloud computing, which is often used to offer Software as a Service (SaaS) over the Internet. SaaS applications can be offered to clients at a lower cost as they are usually multi-tenant: many end users make use of a single application instance, even when they are from different organisations. It is difficult to offer highly customizable SaaS applications that are still multi-tenant, which is why these SaaS applications are often offered in a one size fits all approach.In some application domains applications must be highly customizable, making it more difficult to migrate them to a cloud environment, and losing the benefits of multi-tenancy. In this paper we compare multiple approaches for the development and management of highly customizable multitenant SaaS applications, and present a methodology for developing and managing these applications. We compare two approaches, an application-based approach focusing on deploying multiple multi-tenant applications variants, and a feature-based approach where applications are composed out of multi-tenant services using a service oriented architecture. In addition, we also discuss a hybrid approach combining properties of both. We conclude that the feature-based approach results in the fewest application instances at runtime resulting in more multi-tenancy.},

The analyses depend on the kinds of simulations that can be built, adapted, and extended, which in turn depend on the underlying simulation framework. We report the results of our analysis of 19 agent-based process simulation tools and their simulation frameworks. We conclude that a growing number of simulation tools are using component-based software techniques. Nevertheless, most simulation tools do not directly support requirements models, their transformation into executable simulations, or the management of model variants over time. Such practices are becoming more widely applied in software engineering under the term software product line engineering (SPLE). Based on our analysis, agent-based process simulation tools may improve their customization capacity by: (1) supporting object modeling more completely and (2) supporting software product line engineering issues.},

abstract = {The Product Line Architecture (PLA) is one of the most important artifacts of a Software Product Line. PLA designing has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and successfully solved by a state-of-the-art search-based approach. However, the majority of empirical studies optimize PLA designs without applying one of the fundamental genetic operators: the crossover. An operator for PLA design, named Feature-driven Crossover, was proposed in a previous study. In spite of the promising results, this operator occasionally generated incomplete solutions. To overcome these limitations, this paper aims to enhance the search-based PLA design optimization by improving the Feature-driven Crossover and introducing a novel crossover operator specific for PLA design. The proposed operators were evaluated in two well-studied PLA designs, using three experimental configurations of NSGA-II in comparison with a baseline that uses only mutation operators. Empirical results show the usefulness and efficiency of the presented operators on reaching consistent solutions. We also observed that the two operators complement each other, leading to PLA design solutions with better feature modularization than the baseline experiment.},

abstract = {The problem known as Variability Test of Software Product Line (VTSPL) is related to the selection of the most representative products for the SPL testing. This is an optimization problem because a possible exponential number of products can be derived from the SPL variability model, such as the Feature Model (FM). In the literature many works are dedicated to this research subject, each one applying a different search-based algorithm and using distinct criteria. However, there is no study encompassing all these criteria at the same time. To this end, this paper investigates the use of two Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MaOEAs). We apply the algorithm NSGA-III, widely used for many-objective algorithms, and the algorithm PCA-NSGA-II, a reduction dimensionality algorithm, which uses the Principal-Component Analysis (PCA) in combination with NSGA-II, to evaluate the objectives used in the literature for the VTSPL problem. PCA-NSGA-II reduces the search space dimensionality by eliminating the redundant objectives. The analysis shows the importance of some objectives such as the number of alive mutants, similarity between products, and unselected features. NSGA-III reaches the best results regarding the quality indicators for all instances, but taking a longer time. Besides, PCA-NSGA-II can find different solutions in the search space that are not found by NSGA-III.},

We investigate different distances as well as as single-objective algorithms, (dissimilarity on actions, random, all-actions).

In this paper, we investigate the impact of refactoring variants on the feature location techniques. We first evaluate the performance of two techniques through the ArgoUML SPL benchmark when the variants are refactored. We then discuss the degraded results and the possibility of restoring them. Finally, we outline a process of variant alignment that aims to preserve the performance of the feature location.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is a best practice for managing reuse in families of software systems that is increasingly being applied to novel and emerging domains. In this work we investigate the use of software product line engineering in one of these new domains, synthetic biology. In synthetic biology living organisms are programmed to perform new functions or improve existing functions. These programs are designed and constructed using small building blocks made out of DNA. We conjecture that there are families of products that consist of common and variable DNA parts, and we can leverage product line engineering to help synthetic biologists build, evolve, and reuse DNA parts. In this paper we perform an investigation of domain engineering that leverages an open-source repository of more than 45,000 reusable DNA parts. We show the feasibility of these new types of product line models by identifying features and related artifacts in up to 93.5% of products, and that there is indeed both commonality and variability. We then construct feature models for four commonly engineered functions leading to product lines ranging from 10 to 7.5 \texttimes{} 1020 products. In a case study we demonstrate how we can use the feature models to help guide new experimentation in aspects of application engineering. Finally, in an empirical study we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of automated reverse engineering on both complete and incomplete sets of products. In the process of these studies, we highlight key challenges and uncovered limitations of existing SPL techniques and tools which provide a roadmap for making SPL engineering applicable to new and emerging domains.},

Determining and negotiating the scope in a product line that spans several business units with their own economic goals is challenging. Feature modeling offers a good way to do variability/commonality analysis for complex product lines. A precondition for feature modeling is the identification of all features supporting the product line. To identify these features, we developed a method for systematically deriving a feature model top down based on domain know-how. We call this method domain specific feature modeling. As the primary artifact to describe the problem space, a domain specific feature model additionally improves the requirement understanding for all stakeholders by considerably improving the scoping, traceability, testing, efficiency and transparency of planning activities and making the development efforts easier to estimate. In this paper, we share our experience with domain specific feature modeling in a large platform project and describe the lessons learned. We describe our general approach that can also be used for other domains.},

For a selection of features, specialized products of one domain can be generated automatically from domain artifacts. However, analyses of software product lines need to handle a large number of products that can be exponential in the number of features. In the last decade, many approaches have been proposed to analyze software product lines efficiently. For some of these approaches tool support is available. Based on a recent survey on analysis for software product lines, we provide a first overview on such tools. While our discussion is limited to analysis tools, we provide an accompanying website covering further tools for product-line development. We compare tools according to their analysis and implementation strategy to identify underrepresented areas. In addition, we want to ease the reuse of existing tools for researchers and students, and to simplify research transfer to practice.},

abstract = {The variability of the common features in an Software Product Line (SPL) can be managed by an feature model, an artifact that consist of a tree-shaped diagram, that describe the features identified in the products and the possible relationships between them. Guarantee the quality of the feature model may be essential to ensure that errors do not propagate across all products. The process of evaluating the quality of a product or artifact can be done using measures, which may reflect the characteristics, sub-characteristics or attributes of quality. However, the isolated values of each measure do not allow access to a whole quality of the feature model, since most of the measures cover several specific aspects that are not correlated. In this context, this paper proposes the aggregation of measures in order to evaluate the maintainability of the feature model in SPL. We aim to investigate how to aggregate these measures and access the respective sub-characteristics by means of a single aggregate value that has the same available information as a set of measures. For this, we have used the theory of Fuzzy Logic as a technique for aggregation of these measures. The new aggregate measure represents the maintainability index of a feature models (MIFM) was obtained. Moreover, to evaluate the MIFM, we applied it to a set of models. It was verified that the aggregate measure obtained allows to measure if a feature models has a high or low maintainability index, supporting the domain engineer in the evaluation of the maintenance of the feature model in a faster and more precise way.},

They are used in various environments and have to dynamically adapt themselves accordingly in order to provide an optimal runtime behavior. Naturally, adapting to continuously changing environmental conditions is a challenging task because mobile devices are always limited in their resources and have to adapt in real-time. In this paper, we introduce an approach that enables resource limited devices to adapt to changing conditions using dynamic software product lines techniques. Therefore, feature models are reduced to a specific hardware context before installing the adaptive mobile application on the device. This reduces the amount of possible configurations that are compatible with the device and, thereby, minimizes the costs and the duration of an adaptation during runtime.},

abstract = {In the software product line research, product variants typically differ by their functionality and quality attributes are not purposefully varied. The goal is to study purposeful performance variability in software product lines, in particular, the motivation to vary performance, and the strategy for realizing performance variability in the product line architecture. The research method was a theory-building case study that was augmented with a systematic literature review. The case was a mobile network base station product line with capacity variability. The data collection, analysis and theorizing were conducted in several stages: the initial case study results were augmented with accounts from the literature. We constructed three theoretical models to explain and characterize performance variability in software product lines: the models aim to be generalizable beyond the single case. The results describe capacity variability in a base station product line. Thereafter, theoretical models of performance variability in software product lines in general are proposed. Performance variability is motivated by customer needs and characteristics, by trade-offs and by varying operating environment constraints. Performance variability can be realized by hardware or software means; moreover, the software can either realize performance differences in an emergent way through impacts from other variability or by utilizing purposeful varying design tactics. The results point out two differences compared with the prevailing literature. Firstly, when the customer needs and characteristics enable price differentiation, performance may be varied even with no trade-offs or production cost differences involved. Secondly, due to the dominance of feature modeling, the literature focuses on the impact management realization. However, performance variability can be realized through purposeful design tactics to downgrade the available software resources and by having more efficient hardware.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) provide a promising approach for planning and applying runtime reconfiguration scenarios to adaptive software systems. However, applying DSPLs in the vital domain of highly context-aware systems, e.g., mobile devices, is obstructed by the inherently limited resources being insufficient to handle large, constrained (re-)configurations spaces. To tackle these drawbacks, we propose a novel model-based approach for designing DSPLs in a way that allows for a trade-off between precomputation of reconfiguration scenarios at development time and on-demand evolution at runtime. Therefore, we (1) enrich feature models with context information to reason about potential context changes, and (2) specify context-aware reconfiguration processes on the basis of a scalable transition system incorporating state space abstractions and incremental refinement at runtime. We illustrate our concepts by means of a smartphone case study and present an implementation and evaluation considering different trade-off metrics.},

abstract = {Modern software systems are often built from customizable and inter-dependent components. Such customizations usually define which features are offered by the components, and may depend on backend components being configured in a specific way. As such system become very large, with a huge number of possible configurations and complex dependencies between components, maintenance and ensuring the consistency of such systems is a challenge.In this paper, we propose a Multi Software Product Line model to capture the complexity of such systems and pave the way to formal studies on them. We applied and implemented our model on a full Linux Distribution of almost 40,000 interconnected components and 3 million features, and present some initial analysis we did on this model.},

abstract = {Many variability modeling tasks can be supported by automated analyses of models. Unfortunately, most analyses for Boolean variability models are NP-hard, while analyses for non-Boolean models easily become undecidable. It is thus crucial to exploit the properties of realistic models to construct viable analysis algorithms. Unfortunately, little work exists about non-Boolean models, and no benchmarks are available for such.We present the non-Boolean aspects of 116 variability models available in the codebase of eCos---a real time embedded operating system. We characterize the types of non-Boolean features in the models, kinds and quantities of non-Boolean constraints in use, and the impact of these characteristics on the hardness of this model from analysis perspective. This way we provide researchers and practitioners with a basis for discussion of relevance of non-Boolean models and their analyses, along with the first ever benchmark for effectiveness of such analyses.},

abstract = {Software architects typically spend a great deal of time and effort exploring uncertainties, evaluating alternatives, and balancing the concerns of stakeholders. Selecting the best architecture to meet both the functional and non-functional requirements is a critical but difficult task, especially at the early stage of software development when there may be many uncertainties. For example, how will a technology match the operational or performance expectations in reality? This paper presents an approach to building architecture-centric product line. The main objective of the proposed approach is to support effective requirements validation and architectural prototyping for the application-level software. Architectural prototyping is practically essential to architecture design and evaluation. However, architectural prototyping practiced in the field mostly is not used to explore alternatives. Effective construction and evaluation of multiple architecture alternatives is one of the critically challenging tasks. The product line architecture advocated in this paper consists of multiple software architecture alternatives, from which the architect can select and rapidly generate a working application prototype. The paper presents a case study of developing a framework that is primarily built with robust architecture patterns in distributed and concurrent computing and includes variation mechanisms to support various applications even in different domains. The development process of the framework is an application of software product line engineering with an aim to effectively facilitate upfront requirements analysis for an application and rapid architectural prototyping to explore and evaluate architecture alternatives.},

abstract = {Search-based algorithms have been successfully applied in the Product Line Architecture (PLA) optimization using the seminal approach called Multi-Objective Approach for Product-Line Architecture Design (MOA4PLA). This approach produces a set of alternative PLA designs intending to improve the different factors being optimized. Currently, the MOA4PLA uses the NSGA-II algorithm, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) that can optimize several architectural properties simultaneously. Despite the promising results, studying the best values for the algorithm parameters is essential to obtain even better results. This is also crucial to ease the adoption of MOA4PLA by newcomers or non-expert companies willing to start using search-based software engineering to PLA design. Three crossover operators for the PLA design optimization were proposed recently. However, reference values for parameters have not been defined for PLA design optimization using crossover operators. In this context, the objective of this work is conducting an experimental study to discover which are the most effective crossover operators and the best values to configure the MOEA parameters, such as population size, number of generations, and mutation and crossover rates. A quantitative analysis based on quality indicators and statistical tests was performed using four PLA designs to determine the most suitable parameter values to the search-based algorithm. Empirical results pointed out the best combination of crossover operators and the most suitable values to configure MOA4PLA.},

abstract = {Context: Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the discipline of controlling the evolution of large and complex software systems. Over the years many different SCM systems sharing similar concepts have been implemented from scratch. Since these concepts usually are hard-wired into the respective program code, reuse is hardly possible. Objective: Our objective is to create a model-driven product line for SCM systems. By explicitly describing the different concepts using models, reuse can be performed on the modeling level. Since models are executable, the need for manual programming is eliminated. Furthermore, by providing a library of loosely coupled modules, we intend to support flexible composition of SCM systems. Method: We developed a method and a tool set for model-driven software product line engineering which we applied to the SCM domain. For domain analysis, we applied the FORM method, resulting in a layered feature model for SCM systems. Furthermore, we developed an executable object-oriented domain model which was annotated with features from the feature model. A specific SCM system is configured by selecting features from the feature model and elements of the domain model realizing these features. Results: Due to the orthogonality of both feature model and domain model, a very large number of SCM systems may be configured. We tested our approach by creating instances of the product line which mimic wide-spread systems such as CVS, GIT, Mercurial, and Subversion. Conclusion: The experiences gained from this project demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to model-driven software product line engineering. Furthermore, our work advances the state of the art in the domain of SCM systems since it support the modular composition of SCM systems at the model rather than the code level.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) engineering offers several advantages in the development of families of software products. There is still a need, however, to generate test cases for individual products in product lines more efficiently. In this paper we propose an approach, CONTESA, for generating test cases for SPLs using test suite augmentation. Instead of generating test cases for products independently, our approach generates new test cases for products in an order that allows it to build on test cases created for products tested earlier. In this work, we use a genetic algorithm to generate test cases, targeting branches not yet covered in each product, although other algorithms and coverage criteria could be utilized. We have evaluated CONTESA on two non-trivial SPLs, and have shown that CONTESA is more efficient and effective than an approach that generates test cases for products independently. A further evaluation shows that CONTESA is more effective at achieving coverage, and reveals as many faults as an existing feature-based testing approach.},

abstract = {Feature models are a popular variability modeling notation used in product line engineering. Automated analyses of feature models, such as consistency checking and interactive or offline product selection, often rely on translating models to propositional logic and using satisfiability (SAT) solvers.Efficiency of individual satisfiability-based analyses has been reported previously. We generalize and quantify these studies with a series of independent experiments. We show that previously reported efficiency is not incidental. Unlike with the general SAT instances, which fall into easy and hard classes, the instances induced by feature modeling are easy throughout the spectrum of realistic models. In particular, the phenomenon of phase transition is not observed for realistic feature models.Our main practical conclusion is a general encouragement for researchers to continued development of SAT-based methods to further exploit this efficiency in future.},

abstract = {A fundamental problem of testing Software Product Lines (SPLs) is that variability enables the production of a large number of instances and it is difficult to construct and run test cases even for SPLs with a small number of variable features. Interacting features is a foundation of a fault model for SPLs, where faults are likely to be revealed at execution points where features exchange information with other features or influence one another. Therefore, a test adequacy criterion is to cover as many interactions among different features as possible, thus increasing the probability of finding bugs. Our approach combines a combinatorial designs algorithm for pairwise feature generation with model-based testing to reduce the size of the SPL required for comprehensive coverage of interacting features. We implemented our approach and applied it to an SPL from the automotive domain provided by one of our industrial partners. The results suggest that with our approach higher coverage of feature interactions is achieved at a fraction of cost when compared with a baseline approach of testing all feature interactions.},

Linux is generally perceived as a textbook example for preprocessor-based product derivation, but more than 65 percent of all features are actually handled by the build system. Hence, variability-aware static analysis tools have to take the build system into account.However, extracting variability information from the build system is difficult due to the declarative and turing-complete make language. Existing approaches based on text processing do not cover this challenges and tend to be tailored to a specific Linux version and architecture. This renders them practically unusable as a basis for variability-aware tool support -- Linux is a moving target!We describe a robust approach for extracting implementation variability from the Linux build system. Instead of extracting the variability information by a text-based analysis of all build scripts, our approach exploits the build system itself to produce this information. As our results show, our approach is robust and works for all versions and architectures from the (git-)history of Linux.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of supporting usability in the early stages of a product line architecture design. The product line used as an example is intended to support a variety of different products each with a radically different user interface. The development cycles for new products varies between three years and five years and usability is valued as an important quality attribute for each product in the line.Traditionally, usability is achieved in a product by designing according to specific usability guidelines, and then performing user tests. User interface design can be performed separately from software architecture design and prototyping, but user tests cannot be performed before detailed UI design and prototyping. If the user tests discover usability problems leading to required architectural changes, the company would not know about this until two years after the architecture design was complete. This problem was addressed by identifying a collection of 19 well known usability scenarios that require architectural support. In our example, the stakeholders for the product line prioritized three of these scenarios as key product-line scenarios for improving usability. For each of these three chosen product-line scenarios we developed an architectural responsibility pattern that provided support for the scenario. The responsibilities are expressed in terms of architectural requirements with implementation details and rationales. The responsibilities were embodied in a web based tool for the architects.The two architects for the product line developed a preliminary design and then reviewed their design against the responsibilities supporting the scenarios. The process of review took a day and the architects conservatively estimated that it saved them five weeks of effort later in the project.},

abstract = {Modern software systems should be designed to dynamically adapt to changing user requirements or resource constraints. Delta-oriented programming (DOP) is a compositional approach to flexibly implement software product lines. In DOP, a product line is represented by a code base and a product line declaration. The code base consists of a set of delta modules specifying modifications to object-oriented programs. The product line declaration provides the connection of the delta modules with the product features and describes how the product for a particular feature configuration is generated. DOP has so far only been used for static variability. In this paper, we present dynamic DOP, an extension of DOP that supports changing the feature configuration of a product at runtime. A dynamic DOP product line is a standard DOP product line with a reconfiguration automaton that specifies how to switch between different feature configurations. The type system of our dynamic DOP language ensures that any reconfiguration leads to a type safe product. Dynamic DOP is an approach for realizing dynamic product lines which also supports (unanticipated) software evolution.},

This article aims to report on our positive experience in modeling, controlling, and implementing software variability in the video domain. We describe how we have designed and developed a variability modeling language, called VM, resulting from the close collaboration with industrial partners during 2 years. We expose the specific requirements and advanced variability constructs; we developed and used to characterize and derive variations of video sequences. The results of our experiments and industrial experience show that our solution is effective to model complex variability information and supports the synthesis of hundreds of realistic video variants. From the software language perspective, we learned that basic variability mechanisms are useful but not enough; attributes and multi-features are of prior importance; meta-information and specific constructs are relevant for scalable and purposeful reasoning over variability models. From the video domain and software perspective, we report on the practical benefits of a variability approach. With more automation and control, practitioners can now envision benchmarking video algorithms over large, diverse, controlled, yet realistic datasets (videos that mimic real recorded videos)--something impossible at the beginning of the project.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (LPS) is a paradigm that reuses software artifacts throughout a set of systems that have common and variable characteristics. To guarantee the quality of an SPL and, consequently, of its generated products, it is necessary to use verification and validation activities, such as software inspections. Thus, it is possible to detect defects in different artifacts from the earliest stages in a software development cycle. To support this activity there is a number of techniques, such as SMartyCheck, defined as a checklist-based reading technique, which allows inspection of SMarty UML diagrams. It is important to note that the SMartyCheck technique was previously evaluated in two empirical studies (one qualitative and one quantitative) taking into consideration UML use case diagrams and class diagrams. Both studies pointed out significant results in favor of SMartyCheck. SMartyCheck evolved encompassing UML component diagrams. In this sense, this paper presents initial evidence of the evaluation of SMartyCheck applied for defect detection in UML component diagram based on a controlled experiment carried out in the academy. SMartyCheck was compared to Ad Hoc inspection technique and had superior results for effectiveness and efficiency. Accuracy provided no significant difference between both techniques.},

These challenges relate to process diversity in the face of multiple reuse approaches; the management of requirements and variability; the integration of requirements traceability and variability management; legacy software and discipline vs. software-specific modularization; integration with systems engineering; costing and pricing models; and project vs. product documentation.},

Variability management for a software product line, hence configuration of specific products will be achieved by programming various nodes in a "Software Factory Automation" based architecture, through this language. The architecture suggests a distributed set of interconnected "Domain Specific Engines" that interpret specific languages. Those engines and their corresponding languages assume different fault management capabilities, therefore suggest the design of different languages for fault monitoring, detection, prevention, diagnosis, and repair. The overall fault management capabilities should be supported by the composition of those languages. A high-level definition of the language is presented. The objective of the study is to provide an infrastructure that is more predictable for the development success of fault management systems for families of complex embedded mission critical applications.},

We analyzed similarities and differences among four RPGs. By applying a reuse technique of XVCL, we built an RPG product line architecture (RPG-PLA) from which we could derive any of the four RPGs. We built into the RPG-PLA a number of performance optimization strategies that could benefit any of the four (and possibly other similar) RPGs. By comparing the original vs. the new RPGs derived from the RPG-PLA, we demonstrated that reuse allowed us to achieve improved performance, both speed and memory utilization, as compared to each game developed individually. At the same time, our solution facilitated rapid development of new games, for new mobile devices, as well as ease of evolving with new features the RPG-PLA and custom games already in use.},

abstract = {Product line engineering (PLE) has been employed to large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPSs) to provide customization based on users’ needs. A PLE methodology can be characterized by its support for capturing and managing the abstractions as commonalities and variabilities and the automation of the configuration process for effective selection and customization of reusable artifacts. The automation of a configuration process heavily relies on the captured abstractions and formally specified constraints using a well-defined modeling methodology. Based on the results of our previous work and a thorough literature review, in this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to support multi-stage and multi-step automated product configuration of CPSs, including a comprehensive classification of constraints and a list of automated functionalities of a CPS configuration solution. Such a framework can serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners to evaluate an existing CPS PLE solution or devise a novel CPS PLE solution. To validate the framework, we conducted three real-world case studies. Results show that the framework fulfills all the requirements of the case studies in terms of capturing and managing variabilities and constraints. Results of the literature review indicate that the framework covers all the functionalities concerned by the literature, suggesting that the framework is complete for enabling the maximum automation of configuration in CPS PLE.},

Additionally, a variability management workflow is presented, for not fixing systems at design-time. Instead, variability is left open intentionally and reduced gradually. The combination of these two approaches enables users (e.g. workers) to adapt their robot systems to requirement changes by user-friendly tools and provides flexible service robot allocation.},

abstract = {Variational systems can produce a (potentially huge) number of related systems, known as products or variants, by using features (configuration options) to mark the variable functionality. In many of the application domains, their rigorous verification and analysis are very important, yet the appropriate tools rarely are able to analyse variational systems. Recently, this problem was addressed by designing specialized so-called family-based model checking algorithms, which allow simultaneous verification of all variants in a single run by exploiting the commonalities between the variants. Yet, their computational cost still greatly depends on the number of variants (the size of configuration space), which is often huge. Moreover, their implementation and maintenance represent a costly research and development task. One of the most promising approaches to fighting the configuration space explosion problem is variability abstractions, which simplify variability away from variational systems. In this work, we show how to achieve efficient family-based model checking of CTL⋆ temporal properties using variability abstractions and off-the-shelf (single-system) tools. We use variability abstractions for deriving abstract family-based model checking, where the variability model of a variational system is replaced with an abstract (smaller) version of it, called modal transition system, which preserves the satisfaction of both universal and existential temporal properties, as expressible in CTL⋆. Modal transition systems contain two kinds of transitions, termed may- and must-transitions, which are defined by the conservative (over-approximating) abstractions and their dual (under-approximating) abstractions, respectively. The variability abstractions can be combined with different partitionings of the configuration space to infer suitable divide-and-conquer verification plans for the given variational system. We illustrate the practicality of this approach for several variational systems using the standard version of (single-system) NuSMV model checker.},

Software product line (SPL) engineering can be used as a strategy to implement systems capable of handling such a diversity. To this end, automated tool support is almost indispensable. However, current tool support gives more emphasis to modeling variability in the problem domain, over the support of variability at the solution domain. There is a need for mapping the variability between both abstraction levels, so as to determine what implementation impact a certain variability has. In this paper, we propose the FeatureJS, a FeatureIDE extension aiming at Javascript and HTML support for SPL engineering. The tool combines feature-oriented programming and preprocessors, as a strategy to map variability at source code with the variability modeled at a higher level of abstraction. We carried out a preliminary evaluation with an industrial project, aiming to characterize the capability of the tool to handle SPL engineering in the Web systems domain.},

With over two decades of existence, the community of SPL researchers and practitioners is thriving, as can be attested by the extensive research output and the numerous successful industrial projects. Education has a key role to support the next generation of practitioners to build highly complex, variability-intensive systems. Yet, it is unclear how the concepts of variability and SPLs are taught, what are the possible missing gaps and difficulties faced, what are the benefits, and what is the material available. Also, it remains unclear whether scholars teach what is actually needed by industry. In this article, we report on three initiatives we have conducted with scholars, educators, industry practitioners, and students to further understand the connection between SPLs and education, that is, an online survey on teaching SPLs we performed with 35 scholars, another survey on learning SPLs we conducted with 25 students, as well as two workshops held at the International Software Product Line Conference in 2014 and 2015 with both researchers and industry practitioners participating. We build upon the two surveys and the workshops to derive recommendations for educators to continue improving the state of practice of teaching SPLs, aimed at both individual educators as well as the wider community.},

abstract = {Managing dynamic variability has motivated several researchers to combine Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) practices with runtime variability mechanisms. By combining these approaches, a DSPL acquires important features, ranging from the ability to reconfigure by changing the context, adding or removing features, crash recovery, and re-adaptation based on changes in the model’s features. Feature model (FM) is an important artifact of a DPSL and there is a lack of tools that support the modeling of this artifact. We have extended the DyMMer tool for modeling FM of DSPLs from an adaptation mechanism based on MAPE-K to solve this problem. We migrated the DyMMer tool to a web version and incorporated new features: (i) modeling of FMs from SPLs and DSPLs, (ii) development of an adaptation mechanism for FM of DSPLs, (iii) repository of FMs, (iv) inclusion of thresholds for measures, and (v) user authentication. We believe that this tool is useful for research in the area of DSPLs, and also for dynamic domain modeling and evaluation. Video: https://youtu.be/WVHW6bI8ois},

Currently, Groovy programming language has no tool or framework that supports the implementation of FOP-SPLs. Groovy is a programming language that has been growing in popularity in recent years. Given this scenario, this work proposes and evaluates G4FOP, a light way to develop SPLs using Groovy. G4FOP extends FeatureHouse which is a framework for software composition and FOP. A preliminary evaluation shows that G4FOP covers Groovy grammar. We also demonstrate by an example that G4FOP is suitable to develop SPLs. G4FOP is currently integrated to the official FeatureHouse repository.},

abstract = {The Multi-objective Optimization Approach for Product Line Architecture Design (MOA4PLA) is the seminal approach that successfully optimizes Product Line Architecture (PLA) design using search algorithms. The tool named OPLA-Tool was developed in order to automate the use of MOA4PLA. Over time, the customization of the tool to suit the needs of new research and application scenarios led to several problems. The main problems identified in the original version of OPLA-Tool are environment configuration, maintainability and usability problems, and PLA design modeling and visualization. Such problems motivated the development of a new version of this tool: OPLA-Tool v2.0, presented in this work. In this version, those problems were solved by the source code refactoring, migration to a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) and inclusion of a new support tool for PLA modeling and visualization. Furthermore, OPLA-Tool v2.0 has new functionalities, such as new objective functions, new search operators, intelligent interaction with users during the optimization process, multi-user authentication and simultaneous execution of several experiments to PLA optimization. Such a new version of OPLA-Tool is an important achievement to PLA design optimization as it provides an easier and more complete way to automate this task.},

abstract = {A novel method to optimize the scope of a software product platform is proposed.The method is supported with a mathematical formulation and an optimization solver.Depending on the input parameters and the objectives, competing scopes can exist.The method shows how trade-off analysis can be performed among competing scopes.The results of the method were validated as "satisfiable" to "very satisfiable". ContextDue to increased competition and the advent of mass customization, many software firms are utilizing product families - groups of related products derived from a product platform - to provide product variety in a cost-effective manner. The key to designing a successful software product family is the product platform, so it is important to determine the most appropriate product platform scope related to business objectives, for product line development. AimThis paper proposes a novel method to find the optimized scope of a software product platform based on end-user features. MethodThe proposed method, PPSMS (Product Platform Scoping Method for Software Product Lines), mathematically formulates the product platform scope selection as an optimization problem. The problem formulation targets identification of an optimized product platform scope that will maximize life cycle cost savings and the amount of commonality, while meeting the goals and needs of the envisioned customers' segments. A simulated annealing based algorithm that can solve problems heuristically is then used to help the decision maker in selecting a scope for the product platform, by performing tradeoff analysis of the commonality and cost savings objectives. ResultsIn a case study, PPSMS helped in identifying 5 non-dominated solutions considered to be of highest preference for decision making, taking into account both cost savings and commonality objectives. A quantitative and qualitative analysis indicated that human experts perceived value in adopting the method in practice, and that it was effective in identifying appropriate product platform scope.},

abstract = {A feature model captures various possible configurations of products within a product family. When configuring a product, several features are selected and composed. Selecting features at the program level has a general limitation of not being able to relate the resulting configuration to its requirements. As a result, it is difficult to decide whether a given configuration of features is optimal. An optimal configuration satisfies all stakeholder requirements and quantitative constraints, while ensuring that there is no extraneous feature in it. In relating requirements and feature configurations, we use the description of the problem world context in which the software is designed to operate as the intermediate description between them. The advantage of our approach is that feature selection can be done at the requirements level, and an optimal program level configuration can be generated from the requirements selected. Our approach is illustrated with a real-life problem of configuring a satellite communication software. The use of an existing tool to support our approach is also discussed.},

abstract = {Control flow models, such as UML activity diagrams or Petri nets, are widely accepted modeling languages used to support quality assurance activities in single system engineering as well as software product line (SPL) engineering. Quality assurance in product line engineering is a challenging task since a defect in a domain artifact may affect several products of the product line. Thus, proper quality assurance approaches need to pay special attention to the product line variability. Automation is essential to support quality assurance approaches. A prerequisite for automation is a profound formalization of the underlying control flow models and, in the context of SPLs, of the variability therein. In this paper, we propose a formal syntax and semantics for defining variability in Petri nets. We use these extended Petri nets as a foundation to formally define variability in UML activity diagrams; UML activity diagrams serve as a basis for several testing techniques in product line engineering. We illustrate the contribution of such a formalization to assurance activities in product line engineering by describing its usage in three application examples.},

abstract = {The need for flexible customization of large feature-rich software systems, according to requirements of various stakeholders, has become an important problem in software development. Among the many software engineering approaches dealing with variability management, the notion of Software Product Line (SPL) has emerged as a major unifying concept. Drawing from established disciplines of manufacturing, SPL approaches aim to design repertoires of software artifacts, from which customized software systems for specific stakeholder requirements can be developed. A major difficulty SPL approaches attempt to address is the modularization of software artifacts, which reconciles the user's needs for certain features and the development and technical constraints. Towards this end, many SPL approaches use feature diagrams to describe possible configurations of a feature set. There have been several proposals for feature diagram languages with varying degrees of expressiveness, intuitiveness, and precision. However, these feature diagram languages have limited scalability when applied to realistic software systems. This article provides a systematic survey of various concerns of feature diagrams and ways in which concerns have been separated. The survey shows how the uncertainty in the purpose of feature diagram languages creates both conceptual and practical limitations to scalability of those languages.},

Offering highly configurable applications to thousands of tenants in a shared cloud environment demands for scalable configuration management.

Using an extended feature model (EFM) to express variability of functionality and service qualities, we propose a concept for dynamic configuration management to address the identified requirements. Our proposed configuration management includes an adaptive staged configuration process that is capable of adding and removing stakeholders dynamically and that allows for reconfiguration of variants as stakeholders' objectives change.},

Developers require energy metrics that support sustainable software architectures reflecting quality attributes such as security, reliability, performance, etc., identifying what are the concerns that impact more in the energy consumption.

The experimental measurements are performed by energy experts and researchers that share the energy model and metrics in a collaborative repository. HADAS confronts these tasks modelling and reasoning with the variability of energy consuming concerns for different energy contexts, connecting HADAS variability model with its energy efficiency collaborative repository, establishing a Software Product Line (SPL) service. Our main goal is to help developers to perform sustainability analyses finding out the eco-friendliest architecture configurations.

A total of 39 research papers have been reviewed from an initial set of 1388 papers. The results show that 25% of the papers reported evaluations at the Design phase of the Domain Engineering phase. The most widely used mechanism for modeling quality attributes was extended feature models and the most evaluated artifact was the base architecture. In addition, the results of the review have identified several research gaps. Specifically, 77% of the papers employed case studies as a "proof of concept" whereas 23% of the papers did not perform any type of validation. Our results are particularly relevant in positioning new research activities and in the selection of quality evaluation methods or techniques that best fit a given purpose.},

Product line approaches are applied because large numbers of different product variants need to be developed simultaneously. During development, updated versions of each projected product variant need to be derived from the product line assets repeatedly. Current build tools create each of the numerous product variants one after another. Accordingly, the creation process can take much time. This paper presents an approach to abbreviate this creation process based on the fact that multiple product variants created at once can have parts in common. To benefit from this optimization potential the workflow that creates an individual product variant is subdivided into multiple fragments. Whenever a set of such product variants needs to be created, an optimization algorithm then calculates an individual execution order of the fragments for this set. This order minimizes the total execution time by a systematic reuse of workflow fragment's results for the creation of multiple different product variants.},

abstract = {Software-product-line engineering has gained considerable momentum in recent years, both in industry and in academia. A software product line is a family of software products that share a common set of features. Software product lines challenge traditional analysis techniques, such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving, in their quest of ensuring correctness and reliability of software. Simply creating and analyzing all products of a product line is usually not feasible, due to the potentially exponential number of valid feature combinations. Recently, researchers began to develop analysis techniques that take the distinguishing properties of software product lines into account, for example, by checking feature-related code in isolation or by exploiting variability information during analysis. The emerging field of product-line analyses is both broad and diverse, so it is difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand their similarities and differences. We propose a classification of product-line analyses to enable systematic research and application. Based on our insights with classifying and comparing a corpus of 123 research articles, we develop a research agenda to guide future research on product-line analyses.},

abstract = {Software product lines (SPLs) are based on reuse rationale to aid quick and quality delivery of complex products at scale. Deriving a new product from a product line requires reuse analysis to avoid redundancy and support a high degree of assets reuse. In this paper, we propose and evaluate automated support for recommending SPL assets that can be reused to realize new customer requirements. Using the existing customer requirements as input, the approach applies natural language processing and clustering to generate reuse recommendations for unseen customer requirements in new projects. The approach is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively in the railway industry. Results show that our approach can recommend reuse with 74% accuracy and 57.4% exact match. The evaluation further indicates that the recommendations are relevant to engineers and can support the product derivation and feasibility analysis phase of the projects. The results encourage further study on automated reuse analysis on other levels of abstractions.},

Feature-oriented software development focuses on the representation and compositions of features. The implementation of features often cuts across object-oriented module boundaries and hence comprises interactions. The manual detection and treatment of feature interactions requires a deep knowledge of the implementation details of the features involved. Our goal is to detect interactions automatically using specifications by means of design by contract and automated theorem proving. We provide a software tool that operates on programs in Java and the Java Modeling Language (JML). We discuss which kinds of feature interactions can be detected automatically with our tool and how to detect other kinds of interactions.},

abstract = {A software product line is a family of related programs that are distinguished in terms of features. A feature implements a stakeholders' requirement. Different program variants specified by distinct feature selections are produced from a common code base. The optional feature problem describes a common mismatch between variability intended in the domain and dependencies in the implementation. When this situation occurs, some variants that are valid in the domain cannot be produced due to implementation issues. There are many different solutions to the optional feature problem, but they all suffer from drawbacks such as reduced variability, increased development effort, reduced efficiency, or reduced source code quality. We examine the impact of the optional feature problem in two case studies from the domain of embedded database systems, and we survey different state-of-the-art solutions and their trade-offs. Our intension is to raise awareness of the problem, to guide developers in selecting an appropriate solution for their product line, and to identify opportunities for future research.},

abstract = {During our work on developing and running a software product line for eco-sustainable greenhouse-production software tools, which currently have three products members we have identified a need for extending the notation of the Orthogonal Variability Model (OVM) to support what we refer to as cardinality range dependencies. The cardinality-range-dependency type enables expressing that the binding of a certain number of variants to a variation point can influence variability in other places in the model. In other words, we acknowledge that variability can be influenced, not necessarily by the specific variants being bound, but by their sheer numbers.This paper contributes with an extension to the meta-model underlying the OVM notation, suggesting a notation for the new type of dependency and shows its applicability. The specific case, which initially required this extension, will work as running example throughout the paper and underline the need for the extension. Finally, the paper evaluates and discusses the general applicability of the proposed notation extension and future perspectives.},

However, a fundamental problem in software product line engineering is that a product line of industrial size can easily incorporate several thousand variable features. The complexity caused by this amount of variability makes variability management and product derivation tasks extremely difficult. To address this problem, we present a new method to optimize the variability provided in a software product line. Our method constructs a visualization that provides a classification of the usage of variable features in real products derived from the product line. We show how this classification can be used to derive restructuring strategies for simplifying the variability. The effectiveness of our work is demonstrated by presenting a case study of optimizing the variability in a large industrial software product line.},

abstract = {In many domains such as automotive and avionics, the size and complexity of software systems is quickly increasing. At the same time, many stakeholders tend to be involved in the development of such systems, which typically must also be configured for multiple customers with varying needs. Product Line Engineering (PLE) is therefore an inevitable practice for such systems. Furthermore, because in many areas requirements must be explicit and traceability to them is required by standards, use cases and domain models are common practice for requirements elicitation and analysis. In this paper, based on the above observations, we aim at supporting PLE in the context of use case-centric development. Therefore, we propose, apply, and assess a use case-driven configuration approach which interactively receives configuration decisions from the analysts to generate product-specific (PS) use case and domain models. Our approach provides the following: (1) a use case-centric product line modeling method (PUM), (2) automated, interactive configuration support based on PUM, and (3) an automatic generation of PS use case and domain models from Product Line (PL) models and configuration decisions. The approach is supported by a tool relying on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and integrated with an industrial requirements management tool, i.e., IBM DOORS. We successfully applied and evaluated our approach to an industrial case study in the automotive domain, thus showing evidence that the approach is practical and beneficial to capture variability at the appropriate level of granularity and to configure PS use case and domain models in industrial settings.},

They provide a visual abstraction of the variation points in a family of related software products. FMs can be manually created by domain experts or extracted (semi-) automatically from textual documents such as product descriptions or requirements specifications. Nevertheless, there is no way to measure the accuracy of a FM with respect to the information described in the source documents. This paper proposes a method to quantify and visualize whether the elements in a FM (features and relationships) conform to the information available in a set of specification documents. Both the correctness (choice of representative elements) and completeness (no missing elements) of the FM are considered. Designers can use this feedback to fix defects in the FM or to detect incomplete or inconsistent information in the source documents.},

A configuration problem is defined as generating the most optimal combination of software features given a requirements specification and given a set of configuration rules. Current approaches however provide little support for expressing complex configuration rules between problem and solution space that support incomplete requirements specifications. In this paper, we propose an approach to model complex configuration rules based on a generalization of the concept of problem-solution feature interactions. These are interactions between solution-space features that only arise in specific problem contexts. The use of an existing tool to support our approach is also discussed: we use the DLV answer set solver to express a particular configuration problem as a logic program whose answer set corresponds to the optimal combinations of solution-space features. We motivate and illustrate our approach with a case study in the field of managing dynamic adaptations in distributed software, where the goal is to generate an optimal protocol for accommodating a given adaptation.},

abstract = {Nowadays, embedded systems are gaining importance. At the same time, the development of their software is increasing its complexity, having to deal with quality, cost, and time‐to‐market issues among others. With stringent quality requirements such as performance, early verification and validation become critical in these systems. In this regard, advanced development paradigms such as model‐driven engineering and software product line engineering bring considerable benefits to the development and validation of embedded system software. However, these benefits come at the cost of increasing process complexity. This work presents a process based on UML and MARTE for the analysis of embedded model‐driven product lines. It specifies the tasks, the involved roles, and the workproducts that form the process and how it is integrated in the more general development process. Existing tools that support the tasks to be performed in the process are also described. A classification of such tools and a study of traceability among them are provided, allowing engineering teams to choose the most adequate chain of tools to support the process. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.Embedded systems are becoming ubiquitous, and software running on them is fundamental for them to function.

abstract = {Maintenance in the context of SPLs is a topic of interest, and that still needs further investigation. There are several ways to evaluate the maintainability of a feature model (FM), one of which is a manual or automated analysis of quality measures. However, the use of measures does not allow to evaluate the FM quality as a whole, as each measure considers a specific characteristic of FM. In general, the measures have wide ranges of values and do not have a clear definition of what is appropriate and inappropriate. In this context, the goal of this work is to investigate the use of machine learning techniques to classify the feature model maintainability. The research questions investigated in the study were: (i) how could machine learning techniques aid to classify FMs maintainability; and, (ii) which FM classification model has the best accuracy and precision. In this work, we proposed an approach for FM maintainability classification using machine learning technics. For that, we used a dataset of 15 FM maintainability measures calculated for 326 FMs, and we used machine learning algorithms to clustering. After this, we used thresholds to evaluate the general maintainability of each cluster. With this, we built 5 maintainability classification models that have been evaluated with the accuracy and precision metrics.},

abstract = {Software engineering projects are faced with abstraction, which is achieved by software models, historical evolution, which is addressed by revision control, and variability, which is managed with the help of software product line engineering. Addressing these phenomena by separate tools ignores obvious overlaps and therefore fails at exploiting synergies between revision and variation control for models. In this article, we present a conceptual framework for integrated revision and variation control of model-driven software projects. The framework reuses the abstractions of revision graphs and feature models and follows an iterative, revision-control-like approach to software product line engineering called product-based product line development. A single version (i.e., a variant of a selected revision) is made available in a workspace, where the user may apply arbitrary modifications. Based on a user-provided specification of the affected variants, the changes are automatically written back to a transparent repository that relies on an internal multi-version storage. The uniform handling of revisions and variants of models is achieved by transparently mapping version concepts to a semantic base layer, which is defined upon propositional logic. At the heart of the conceptual framework is a dynamic filtered editing model, which allows that the versioned artifacts and the feature model co-evolve. We contribute algorithms for checkout and commit, which satisfy a set of consistency constraints referring to variant specifications in an evolving feature model. This article furthermore addresses the orchestration of collaborative development by distributed replication and the well formedness of text and model artifacts to be checked out into the workspace. The Eclipse-based tool SuperMod demonstrates the feasibility of the conceptual framework. It allows the user to reuse arbitrary editing tools for text-based programming and/or Ecore-based modeling languages. An evaluation based on three case studies investigates the properties of SuperMod with a specific focus on filtered editing. The evaluation demonstrates that the dynamic filtered editing model reduces the cognitive complexity and the amount of user interaction necessary for variation control when compared to unfiltered model-driven approaches to software product line engineering.},

abstract = {Deriving a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) product from a product line requires configuring hundreds to thousands of configurable parameters of components and devices from multiple domains, e.g., computing, control, and communication. A fully automated configuration process for a CPS product line is seldom possible in practice, and a dynamic and interactive process is expected. Therefore, some configurable parameters are to be configured manually, and the rest can be configured either automatically or manually, depending on pre-defined constraints, the order of configuration steps, and previous configuration data in such a dynamic and interactive configuration process. In this article, we propose a pattern-based, interactive configuration derivation methodology (named as Pi-CD) to maximize opportunities of automatically deriving correct configurations of CPSs by benefiting from pre-defined constraints and configuration data of previous configuration steps. Pi-CD requires architectures of CPS product lines modeled with Unified Modeling Language extended with four types of variabilities, along with constraints specified in Object Constraint Language (OCL). Pi-CD is equipped with 324 configuration derivation patterns that we defined by systematically analyzing the OCL constructs and semantics. We evaluated Pi-CD by configuring 20 CPS products of varying complexity from two real-world CPS product lines. Results show that Pi-CD can achieve up to 72% automation degree with a negligible time cost. Moreover, its time performance remains stable with the increase in the number of configuration parameters as well as constraints.},

This paper provides a systematic literature review and key research issues related to the FM defects in PL. We derive a typology of FM defects according to their level of importance. The information on defects’ identification and explanations are provided with formalization. Further, corrective explanations are presented which incorporates various techniques used to fix defects with their implementation. This information would help software engineering community by enabling developers or modelers to find the types of defects and their causes and to choose an appropriate technique to fix defects in order to produce defect-free products from FMs, thereby enhancing the overall quality of PL-based development.},

abstract = {Need for adaptiveness of business applications is on the rise with continued increase in business dynamics. Ground-up development techniques neither deliver nor can scale in this dynamic situation. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) aims to increase adaptiveness by capturing commonality and variability up front to suitably configure the application from its parts. Code-centric SPLE techniques show unacceptable responsiveness when business applications are subjected to changes along multiple simultaneously evolving dimensions. Using clear separation of functional concerns from implementation platform, model driven approaches enable easy delivery of the same functionality into multiple technology platforms. However, business applications exhibit variability in several dimensions such as functionality, business process, design decisions, architecture, and technology platform. We argue that SPLE techniques need to be elevated to a higher level of abstraction to enable them to work in unison with model-driven techniques in order to realize the desired adaptiveness along all these dimensions. We have been delivering large business applications using model-driven techniques for past 15 years. In this paper, we have outlined several key challenges that we faced in adopting SPLE and presented tenets of a solution that is likely to have greater acceptance by industry practice.},

abstract = {Software that support various groups of customers usually require complicated configurations to attain different functionalities. To model the configuration options, feature model is proposed to capture the commonalities and competing variabilities of the product variants in software family or Software Product Line (SPL). A key challenge for deriving a new product is to find a set of features that do not have inconsistencies or conflicts, yet optimize multiple objectives (e.g., minimizing cost and maximizing number of features), which are often competing with each other. Existing works have attempted to make use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to address this problem. In this work, we incorporated a novel feedback-directed mechanism into existing EAs. Our empirical results have shown that our method has improved noticeably over all unguided version of EAs on the optimal feature selection. In particular, for case studies in SPLOT and LVAT repositories, the feedback-directed Indicator-Based EA (IBEA) has increased the number of correct solutions found by 72.33% and 75%, compared to unguided IBEA. In addition, by leveraging a pre-computed solution, we have found 34 sound solutions for Linux X86, which contains 6888 features, in less than 40 seconds.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) represents a family of products in a given application domain. Each SPL is constructed to provide for the derivation of new products by covering a wide range of features in its domain. Nevertheless, over time, some domain features may become obsolete with the apparition of new features while others may become refined. Accordingly, the SPL must be maintained to account for the domain evolution. Such evolution requires a means for managing the impact of changes on the SPL models, including the feature model and design. This paper presents an automated method that analyzes feature model evolution, traces their impact on the SPL design, and offers a set of recommendations to ensure the consistency of both models. The proposed method defines a set of new metrics adapted to SPL evolution to identify the effort needed to maintain the SPL models consistently and with a quality as good as the original models. The method and its tool are illustrated through an example of an SPL in the Text Editing domain. In addition, they are experimentally evaluated in terms of both the quality of the maintained SPL models and the precision of the impact change management.},

abstract = {In Product Line Engineering, as in any other modeling domain, designers and end users are prone to making inconsistent assumptions (errors) because of complexity and lack of system knowledge. We previously envisioned a way of allowing inconsistencies during product configuration and in this paper we present a solution on how to realize this vision. We introduce HUMUS (High-level Union of Minimal Unsatisfiable Sets), which enables correct reasoning in product line engineering (encoded in SAT) despite the presence of errors. We focus mainly on tolerating inconsistencies during product configuration, to make it possible to resolve inconsistencies later without misguiding the human user along the way. We also provide a discussion of other applications in product line engineering and beyond. The main advantage of using HUMUS is, that it is possible to isolate erroneous parts of a product line model such that existing automations continue to be useful. The applications of HUMUS are thus likely beyond product line engineering.},

abstract = {We introduce the feature-oriented language FLan as a proof of concept for specifying both declarative aspects of product families, namely constraints on their features, and procedural aspects, namely feature configuration and run-time behaviour. FLan is inspired by the concurrent constraint programming paradigm. A store of constraints allows one to specify in a declarative way all common constraints on features, including inter-feature constraints. A standard yet rich set of process-algebraic operators allows one to specify in a procedural way the configuration and behaviour of products. There is a close interaction between both views: (i) the execution of a process is constrained by its store to forbid undesired configurations; (ii) a process can query a store to resolve design and behavioural choices; (iii) a process can update the store by adding new features. An implementation in the Maude framework allows for a variety of formal automated analyses of product families specified in FLan, ranging from consistency checking to model checking.},

abstract = {Software reuse lowers development costs and improves the quality of software systems. Two strategies are common: clone &amp; own (copying and adapting a system) and platform-oriented reuse (building a configurable platform). The former is readily available, flexible, and initially cheap, but does not scale with the frequency of reuse, imposing high maintenance costs. The latter scales, but imposes high upfront investments for building the platform, and reduces flexibility. As such, each strategy has distinctive advantages and disadvantages, imposing different development activities and software architectures. Deciding for one strategy is a core decision with long-term impact on an organization’s software development. Unfortunately, the strategies’ costs are not well-understood - not surprisingly, given the lack of systematically elicited empirical data, which is difficult to collect. We present an empirical study of the development activities, costs, cost factors, and benefits associated with either reuse strategy. For this purpose, we combine quantitative and qualitative data that we triangulated from 26 interviews at a large organization and a systematic literature review covering 57 publications. Our study both confirms and refutes common hypotheses on software reuse. For instance, we confirm that developing for platform-oriented reuse is more expensive, but simultaneously reduces reuse costs; and that platform-orientation results in higher code quality compared to clone &amp; own. Surprisingly, refuting common hypotheses, we find that change propagation can be more expensive in a platform, that platforms can facilitate the advancement into innovative markets, and that there is no strict distinction of clone &amp; own and platform-oriented reuse in practice.},

abstract = {Service orientation (SO) is a relevant promising candidate for accommodating rapidly changing user needs and expectations. One of the goals of adopting SO is the improvement of reusability, however, the development of service-based system in practice has uncovered several challenging issues, such as how to identify reusable services, how to determine configurations of services that are relevant to users' current product configuration and context, and how to maintain service validity after configuration changes. In this paper, we propose a method that addresses these issues by adapting a feature-oriented product line engineering approach. The method is notable in that it guides developers to identify reusable services at the right level of granularity and to map users' context to relevant service configuration, and it also provides a means to check the validity of services at runtime in terms of invariants and pre/post-conditions of services. Moreover, we propose a heterogeneous style based architecture model for developing such systems.},

Moreover, identifying the existence of dynamic PL approaches for BPM. MethodA SLR was conducted with four research questions formulated to evaluate PL approaches for BPM. Results63 papers were selected as primary studies according to the criteria established. From these primary studies, only 15 papers address the specific dynamic aspects in the context evaluated. Moreover, it was found that PLs only partially address the BPM lifecycle since the last business process phase is not a current concern on the found approaches. ConclusionsThe found PL approaches for BPM only cover partially the BPM lifecycle, not taking into account the last phase which restarts the lifecycle. Moreover, no wide dynamic PL proposal was found for BPM, but only the treatment of specific dynamic aspects. The results indicate that PL approaches for BPM are still at an early stage and gaining maturity.},

abstract = {In the software product line configuration process, certain features are selected based on the stakeholders' needs and preferences regarding the available functional and quality properties. This book chapter presents how a product configuration can be modeled as a decision process and how an optimal strategy representing the stakeholders' desirable configuration can be found. In the decision process model of product configuration, the product is configured by making decisions at a number of decision points. The decisions at each of these decision points contribute to functional and quality attributes of the final product. In order to find an optimal strategy for the decision process, a utility-based approach can be adopted, through which, the strategy with the highest utility is selected as the optimal strategy. In order to define utility for each strategy, a multi-attribute utility function is defined over functional and quality properties of a configured product and a utility elicitation process is then introduced for finding this utility function. The utility elicitation process works based on asking gamble queries over functional and quality requirement from the stakeholder. Using this utility function, the optimal strategy and therefore optimal product configuration is determined.},

abstract = {Family-based SPL model checking concerns the simultaneous verification of multiple product models, aiming to improve on enumerative product-based verification, by capitalising on the common features and behaviour of products in a software product line (SPL), typically modelled as a featured transition system (FTS). We propose efficient family-based SPL model checking of modal -calculus formulae on FTSs based on variability parity games, which extend parity games with conditional edges labelled with feature configurations, by reducing the SPL model checking problem for the modal -calculus on FTSs to the variability parity game solving problem, based on an encoding of FTSs as variability parity games. We validate our contribution by experiments on SPL benchmark models, which demonstrate that a novel family-based algorithm to collectively solve variability parity games, using symbolic representations of the configuration sets, outperforms the product-based method of solving the standard parity games obtained by projection with classical algorithms.},

abstract = {Reusability is an important quality attribute for defense modeling and simulation (MS) due to the ever-changing combat simulations and new requirements. There has been research conducted worldwide for reusing simulation models. The methods proposed in these studies (including One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF)) support reuse of simulation components in the development of new models. As the reuse units in the existing methods are at the simulation component level, when existing components do not satisfy new simulation requirements, new components have to be developed and maintained separately from the existing ones. However, simulation components in the same domain tend to have common parts; behavior models for tactical missions and battlefield functions in the same domain are derived from the same tactical doctrine/manual, and thus they tend to have a common structure. There is a need for a new method to maximize reusability by providing \^{a} fine-grained\^{a} reuse, i.e. composing simulation components from reusable fine-grained modules (i.e. behaviors/functions). We address the problem by applying the product line engineering concept to the development of simulation components. Commonalities and variabilities (CVs) of domain-specific simulation requirements and CVs of tactical behaviors and battlefield functions are identified in domain-oriented variability modeling. Then, the CVs are used to design and implement domain-specific simulation component assets with domain-specific tactical behaviors and battlefield functions while embedding the identified variabilities. These domain-specific component assets are instantiated based on selections of variabilities and then integrated to develop a simulation model. Feasibility of the method was demonstrated in an infantry squad combat domain of the Republic of Korea armed forces.},

abstract = {A software product line is a family of related software products, typically, generated from a set of common assets. Users can select features to derive a product that fulfills their needs. Often, users expect a product to have specific non-functional properties, such as a small footprint or a minimum response time. Because a product line can contain millions of products, it is usually not feasible to generate and measure non-functional properties for each possible product of a product line. Hence, we propose an approach to predict a product's non-functional properties, based on the product's feature selection. To this end, we generate and measure a small set of products, and by comparing the measurements, we approximate each feature's non-functional properties. By aggregating the approximations of selected features, we predict the product's properties. Our technique is independent of the implementation approach and language. We show how already little domain knowledge can improve predictions and discuss trade-offs regarding accuracy and the required number of measurements. Although our approach is in general applicable for quantifiable non-functional properties, we evaluate it for the non-functional property footprint. With nine case studies, we demonstrate that our approach usually predicts the footprint with an accuracy of 98% and an accuracy of over 99% if feature interactions are known.},

[Aims] This paper aims to evaluate engineers' performance fixing errors and propagating the fixes to other configured products in the context of an industrial SPL. [Method] We designed and conducted an empirical study to collect data with regard to bug-fixing tasks within the context of a Induction Hob SPL in the BSH group, the largest manufacturer of home appliances in Europe. [Results] We found that effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction got reached good values. Through interviews we also found difficulties related to unused features, cloning features unintentionally, detecting modified features, and propagating the fix when the source of the bug is the interaction between features. [Conclusions] The identified difficulties are relevant to know how to better apply SPLs in industry in the future.},

abstract = {The increasing complexity and cost of software-intensive systems has led developers to seek ways of reusing software components across development projects. One approach to increasing software reusability is to develop a software product-line (SPL), which is a software architecture that can be reconfigured and reused across projects. Rather than developing software from scratch for a new project, a new configuration of the SPL is produced. It is hard, however, to find a configuration of an SPL that meets an arbitrary requirement set and does not violate any configuration constraints in the SPL. Existing research has focused on techniques that produce a configuration of an SPL in a single step. Budgetary constraints or other restrictions, however, may require multi-step configuration processes. For example, an aircraft manufacturer may want to produce a series of configurations of a plane over a span of years without exceeding a yearly budget to add features. This paper provides three contributions to the study of multi-step configuration for SPLs. First, we present a formal model of multi-step SPL configuration and map this model to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Second, we show how solutions to these SPL configuration problems can be automatically derived with a constraint solver by mapping them to CSPs. Moreover, we show how feature model changes can be mapped to our approach in a multi-step scenario by using feature model drift. Third, we present empirical results demonstrating that our CSP-based reasoning technique can scale to SPL models with hundreds of features and multiple configuration steps.},

abstract = {ContextA common way to represent product lines is with variability modeling. Yet, there are different ways to extract and organize relevant characteristics of variability. Comprehensibility of these models and the ease of creating models are important for the efficiency of any variability management approach. ObjectiveThe goal of this paper is to investigate the comprehensibility of two common styles to organize variability into models hierarchical and constrained where the dependencies between choices are specified either through the hierarchy of the model or as cross-cutting constraints, respectively. MethodWe conducted a controlled experiment with a sample of 90 participants who were students with prior training in modeling. Each participant was provided with two variability models specified in Common Variability Language (CVL) and was asked to answer questions requiring interpretation of provided models. The models included 920 nodes and 819 edges and used the main variability elements. After answering the questions, the participants were asked to create a model based on a textual description. ResultsThe results indicate that the hierarchical modeling style was easier to comprehend from a subjective point of view, but there was also a significant interaction effect with the degree of dependency in the models, that influenced objective comprehension. With respect to model creation, we found that the use of a constrained modeling style resulted in higher correctness of variability models. ConclusionsPrior exposure to modeling style and the degree of dependency among elements in the model determine what modeling style a participant chose when creating the model from natural language descriptions. Participants tended to choose a hierarchical style for modeling situations with high dependency and a constrained style for situations with low dependency. Furthermore, the degree of dependency also influences the comprehension of the variability model.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) involved variability modeling in domain engineering that will be matched to the respected application engineering. Several researches existed within the scope of mapping from reference architecture (RA) in domain engineering to system architecture in application engineering within the same domain. However, the mapping of cross domain RA or Multi Product Line (MPL) required more systematic mapping due to the several participating product line architecture (PLA) that will further instantiated to specific system architecture. The objective of this paper was to propose an actor-oriented approach in the mapping process of reference architecture, product line architecture and system architecture of MPL. Since the reference architecture consisted of several components, the scope of this research was within the functional decomposition or source code level. The experiment was involving the runtime behavior of the java code. The code with actor-oriented approach had shown the least amount of time taken to complete the main method compared to the non-actor-oriented approach. In conclusion, actor-oriented approach performs better performance in the mapping of reference architecture to product line architecture and system architecture. For future work, the consistency of the mapping will be evaluated.},

abstract = {Quality evaluation is a challenging task in monolithic software systems. It is even more complex when it comes to Service-Oriented Software Product Lines (SOSPL), as it needs to analyze the attributes of a family of SOA systems. In SOSPL, variability can be planned and managed at the architectural level to develop a software product with the same set of functionalities but different degrees of non-functional quality attribute satisfaction. Therefore, architectural quality evaluation becomes crucial due to the fact that it allows for the examination of whether or not the final product satisfies and guarantees all the ranges of quality requirements within the envisioned scope. This paper addresses the open research problem of aggregating QoS attribute ranges with respect to architectural variability. Previous solutions for quality aggregation do not consider architectural variability for composite services. Our approach introduces variability patterns that can possibly occur at the architectural level of an SOSPL. We propose an aggregation model for QoS computation which takes both variability and composition patterns into account.},

abstract = {Software Product Line, SPL, is a software development strategy in which products are developed from a common set of core assets in a prescribed way with product specific features to satisfy specific market segment [1]. The SPL development process is carried out in two phases: the first phase is about building core assets called domain engineering, which has gained a lot of researchers' attention. The second step is about instantiating the specifics of the products by adding to the common part the specific features that identify the product from the other application engineering. For large and complex domains, it is argued that organizing and retrieving the development of artifacts from the core asset required by the application under development is a way of shortening the application development time, thus reduces the time to market. In this paper, we propose an automation mechanism for organizing the core assets using feature based organization to divide the customized domain feature model based on the application features and their dependencies. When that retrieval step where the artifacts are represented by relations that inherit the dependencies between the features in each division of the feature model, takes place, the final result is a set of development artifacts with their traceability links to be customized based on the application variability model and integrated with the application specific artifacts. To demonstrate our work, we applied this mechanism on a watch, a case study in the digital watch domain.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines Engineering (SPLE) proposes techniques to model, create and improve groups of related software systems in a systematic way, with different alternatives formally expressed, e.g., as Feature Models. Selecting the ‘best’ software system(s) turns into a problem of improving the quality of selected subsets of software features (components) from feature models, or as it is widely known, Feature Configuration. When there are different independent dimensions to assess how good a software product is, the problem becomes even more challenging – it is then a multi-objective optimisation problem. Another big issue for software systems is evolution where software components change. This is common in the industry but, as far as we know, there is no algorithm designed to the particular case of multi-objective optimisation of evolving software product lines. In this paper we present MILPIBEA, a novel hybrid algorithm which combines the scalability of a genetic algorithm (IBEA) with the accuracy of a mixed-integer linear programming solver (IBM ILOG CPLEX). We also study the behaviour of our solution (MILPIBEA) in contrast with SATIBEA, a state-of-the-art algorithm in static software product lines. We demonstrate that MILPIBEA outperforms SATIBEA on average, especially for the most challenging problem instances, and that MILPIBEA is the one that continues to improve the quality of the solutions when SATIBEA stagnates (in the evolving context).},

abstract = {Cloud-based technologies play an increasing role in software engineering because of their scalability, availability, and cost efficiency. However, due to privacy issues, developers and organizations still hesitate to host applications that handle sensitive data on servers of external cloud providers. Modern hardware extensions, such as Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), are an attempt to provide confidentiality and integrity for applications running on external hardware. Still, enabling SGX in cloud systems poses new challenges considering scalability and flexibility. In this paper, we propose an approach to address these issues by employing concepts from the domain of Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs). We aim to enable applications running on SGX-based cloud systems to be securely reconfigurable and extendable during runtime. In particular, we describe properties that such an approach should fulfill and discuss corresponding challenges.},

abstract = {High development and maintenance costs and a high error rate are the major problems in the development of automation systems, which are mainly caused by bad communication and inefficient reuse methods. To overcome these problems, we propose a more systematic reuse approach. Though systematic reuse approaches such as software product lines are appealing, they tend to involve rather burdensome development and management processes. This paper focuses on small enterprises. Since such companies are often unable to perform a "big bang" adoption of the software product line, we suggest an incremental, more lightweight process to transition from single-system development to software product line development. Besides the components of the transition process, this paper discusses tool selection, DSL technology, stakeholder communication support, and business considerations. Although based on problems from the automation system domain, we believe the approach may be general enough to be applicable in other domains as well. The approach has proven successful in two case studies. First, we applied it to a research project for the automation of a logistics lab model, and in the second case (a real-life industry case), we investigated the approaches suitability for fish farm automation systems. Several metrics were collected throughout the evolution of each case, and this paper presents the data for single system development, clone&amp;own and software product line development. The results and observable effects are compared, discussed, and finally summarized in a list of lessons learned.},

abstract = {In the context of Software Product Lines (SPLs), evaluating the quality of a feature model is essential to ensure that errors in the early stages do not spread throughout the SPL. One way to evaluate a feature model is to use measures. However, measures alone are not enough to characterize the feature model quality, because most of them cover specific aspects, such as the number of features. So, there is a need for methods to aggregate measures at the level of quality sub-characteristic or characteristic. In this paper, we aim to investigate how to aggregate measures that have been proposed to evaluate the quality of feature models in SPL. We have used the fuzzy logic theory in order to aggregate these measures. The new aggregated measures can be applied to evaluate different and complex aspects of a feature model, such as: size, stability, flexibility and dynamicity. Moreover, to evaluate the use of the new aggregate measures, we applied them in different feature models. Our findings suggest that aggregate measures can assist the domain engineer in evaluating the maintainability of feature models.},

Even though families of safety-critical systems exist with many similar, yet not equal, variants there is no dedicated variability mechanism for CFDs to reuse commonalities of all family members and to alter only variable parts. In this paper, we present a variability representation approach for CFDs based on delta modeling that allows to transform an initial CFD within a closed or open variant space. Furthermore, we provide delta-aware analysis techniques for CFDs in order to analyse multiple variants efficiently.

Currently developed CBTC platforms are actually very complex systems including several functionalities, and every installed system, developed by a different company, varies in extent, scope, number, and even names of the implemented functionalities. International standards have emerged, but they remain at a quite abstract level, mostly setting terminology. This paper presents the results of an experience in defining a global model of CBTC, by mixing semi-formal modelling and product line engineering. The effort has been based on an in-depth market analysis, not limiting to particular aspects but considering as far as possible the whole picture. The paper also describes a methodology to derive novel CBTC products from the global model, and to define system requirements for the individual CBTC components. To this end, the proposed methodology employs scenario-based requirements elicitation aided with rapid prototyping. To enhance the quality of the requirements, these are written in a constrained natural language (CNL), and evaluated with natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The final goal is to go toward a formal representation of the requirements for CBTC systems. The overall approach is discussed, and the current experience with the implementation of the method is presented. In particular, we show how the presented methodology has been used in practice to derive a novel CBTC architecture.},

abstract = {Feature models are a helpful means to document, manage, maintain, and configure the variability of a software system, and thus are a core artifact in software product-line engineering. Due to the various purposes of feature models, they can be a cross-cutting concern in an organization, integrating technical and business aspects. For this reason, various stakeholders (e.g., developers and consultants) may get involved into modeling the features of a software product line. Currently, collaboration in such a scenario can only be done with face-to-face meetings or by combining single-user feature-model editors with additional communication and version-control systems. While face-to-face meetings are often costly and impractical, using version-control systems can cause merge conflicts and inconsistency within a model, due to the different intentions of the involved stakeholders. Advanced tools that solve these problems by enabling collaborative, real-time feature modeling, analogous to Google Docs or Overleaf for text editing, are missing. In this article, we build on a previous paper and describe (1) the extended formal foundations of collaborative, real-time feature modeling, (2) our conflict resolution algorithm in more detail, (3) proofs that our formalization converges and preserves causality as well as user intentions, (4) the implementation of our prototype, and (5) the results of an empirical evaluation to assess the prototype’s usability. Our contributions provide the basis for advancing existing feature-modeling tools and practices to support collaborative feature modeling. The results of our evaluation show that our prototype is considered helpful and valuable by 17 users, also indicating potential for extending our tool and opportunities for new research directions.},

abstract = {Software product lines are increasingly built using components from specialized suppliers. A company that is in the middle of a supply chain has to integrate components from its suppliers and offer (partially configured) products to its customers. To satisfy both the variability required by each customer and the variability required to satisfy different customers' needs, it may be necessary for such a company to use components from different suppliers, partly offering the same feature set. This leads to a product line with alternative components, possibly using different mechanisms for interfacing, binding and variability, which commonly occurs in embedded software development. In this paper, we describe the limitations of the current practice of combining heterogeneous components in a product line and describe the challenges that arise from software supply chains. We introduce a model-driven approach for automating the integration between components that can generate a partially or fully configured variant, including glue between mismatched components. We analyze the consequences of using this approach in an industrial context, using a case study derived from an existing supply chain and describe the process and roles associated with this approach.},

abstract = {This work states that there is a need for an optimized problem space representation for heterogeneous domains. We identify two modeling paradigms widely used in practice: Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) and Feature-Oriented Domain Modeling (FODM). Each modeling paradigm favors different domain characteristics. Especially the fact that software often is embedded either in a system or in a process and, therefore, is strongly influenced by its environment enforces the demand for a combined representation.We propose a concept for a multi-modeling approach based on existing technology. Multi-modeling means the combination of the two main modeling paradigms to represent a heterogeneous domain. The major benefit of the approach is the reduction of representation complexity by optimizing the representation of single subdomains. This will be shown on one representative case study from the automotive domain. Another advantage is the improved stakeholder communication because of familiar notations. A discussion of limitations shows potential for future work.},

ObjectiveIn the context of PLE, providing immediate feedback on the correctness of a manual configuration step to users has a practical impact on whether a configuration process with tool support can be successfully adopted in practice. MethodIn an existing work, a UML-based variability modeling methodology named as SimPL and an interactive configuration process was proposed. Based on the existing work, we propose an automated, incremental and efficient conformance checking approach to ensure that the manual configuration of a variation point conforms to a set of pre-defined conformance rules specified in the Object Constraint Language (OCL). The proposed approach, named as Zen-CC, has been implemented as an integrated part of our product configuration and derivation tool: Zen-Configurator. ResultsThe performance and scalability of Zen-CC have been evaluated with a real-world case study. Results show that Zen-CC significantly outperformed two baseline engines in terms of performance. Besides, the performance of Zen-CC remains stable during the configuration of all the 10 products of the product line and its efficiency also remains un-impacted even with the growing product complexity, which is not the case for both of the baseline engines. ConclusionThe results suggest that Zen-CC performs practically well and is much more scalable than the two baseline engines and is scalable for configuring products with a larger number of variation points.},

On a conceptual level, functionality of an SPL is modeled in terms of features in Feature Models (FMs). As other software systems, SPLs and their FMs are subject to evolution that may lead to the introduction of anomalies (e.g., non-selectable features). To fix such anomalies, developers need to understand the cause for them. However, for large evolution histories and large SPLs, explanations may become very long and, as a consequence, hard to understand. In this paper, we present a method for anomaly detection and explanation that, by encoding the entire evolution history, identifies the evolution step of anomaly introduction and explains which of the performed evolution operations lead to it. In our evaluation, we show that our method significantly reduces the complexity of generated explanations.},

In the SPL testing, a great challenge is the integration of test methods and techniques with the SPL engineering. To do this, some strategies have been proposed, however, they have not been properly evaluated and compared. In this paper a case study is described comparing three different test strategies: the product by product strategy that tests each product individually; an incremental strategy that tests the products reusing test cases from products previously tested; and a strategy that instantiates test data derived in the domain engineering, considering SPL commonalities and variabilities. In the study an SPL from the games domain was used, and the test data were generated from use cases. The results show that SPL oriented strategies are associated to greater percentages of reuse, and consequently, with lower effort to write test cases.},

abstract = {Mass customization in modern industries leads to an increased complexity in product line engineering due to the high level of variability. Real-world industry-sized product lines can easily end up with thousands of features and constraints. Using sophisticated information visualization techniques is one important component in handling this complexity successfully as they provide a higher level of cognitive support and make the comprehension of the underlying structures easier and faster. However, it is still an unresolved problem to handle the occurring variability in a satisfactory way. This means that we need visualization mechanisms able to cope with the requirements of engineers as well as with the needs of the responsible managers. This paper addresses the issue of visualizing large product lines and discusses different techniques which can be used towards an efficient visualization of variability. Furthermore, it presents alternative methods to visualize complex constraints and group cardinalities. These techniques will then be illustrated with the help of a prototypical implementation.},

abstract = {In software product line engineering, the design of assets for reuse and the derivation of software products entails low-level and high-level decision making. In this process, two major types of decisions must be addressed: variability decisions, i.e., decisions made as part of variability management, and architectural decisions, i.e., fundamental decisions to be made during the design of the architecture of the product line or the products. In practice, variability decisions often overlap with or influence architectural decisions. For instance, resolving a variability may enable or prevent some architectural options. This inherent interdependence has not been explicitly and systematically targeted in the literature, and therefore, is mainly resolved in an ad hoc and informal manner today. In this paper, we discuss possible ways how variability and architectural decisions interact, as well as their management and integration in a systematic manner. We demonstrate the integration between the two types of decisions in a motivating case and leverage existing tools for implementing our proposal.},

abstract = {Context: Complex software-intensive systems comprise many subsystems that are often based on heterogeneous technological platforms and managed by different organizational units. Multi product lines (MPLs) are an emerging area of research addressing variability management for such large-scale or ultra-large-scale systems. Despite the increasing number of publications addressing MPLs the research area is still quite fragmented. Objective: The aims of this paper are thus to identify, describe, and classify existing approaches supporting MPLs and to increase the understanding of the underlying research issues. Furthermore, the paper aims at defining success-critical capabilities of infrastructures supporting MPLs. Method: Using a systematic literature review we identify and analyze existing approaches and research issues regarding MPLs. Approaches described in the literature support capabilities needed to define and operate MPLs. We derive capabilities supporting MPLs from the results of the systematic literature review. We validate and refine these capabilities based on a survey among experts from academia and industry. Results: The paper discusses key research issues in MPLs and presents basic and advanced capabilities supporting MPLs. We also show examples from research approaches that demonstrate how these capabilities can be realized. Conclusions: We conclude that approaches supporting MPLs need to consider both technical aspects like structuring large models and defining dependencies between product lines as well as organizational aspects such as distributed modeling and product derivation by multiple stakeholders. The identified capabilities can help to build, enhance, and evaluate MPL approaches.},

abstract = {In the context of product line engineering of cyber-physical systems, there exists a large number of constraints to support, for example, consistency checking of design decisions made in hardware and software components during configuration. Manual configuration is not feasible in this context considering that managing and manipulating all these constraints in a real industrial context is very complicated and thus warrants an automated solution. Typical automation activities in this context include automated configuration value inference, optimizing configuration steps and consistency checking. However, to this end, relevant constraints have to be well-specified and characterized in the way such that automated configuration can be enabled. In this paper, we classify and characterize constraints that are required to be specified to support most of the key functionalities of any automated product configuration solution, based on our experience of studying three industrial product lines.},

Deriving products from a Feature Model (FM) for testing Software Product Lines (SPLs) is a hard task. It is important to select a minimum number of products but, at the same time, to consider the coverage of testing criteria such as pairwise, among other factors. To solve such problems Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied. However, to design a solution for this and other software engineering problems can be very difficult, because it is necessary to choose among different search operators and parameters. Hyper-heuristics can help in this task, and have raised interest in the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) field. Considering the growing adoption of SPL in the industry and crescent demand for SPL testing approaches, this paper introduces a hyper-heuristic approach to automatically derive products to variability testing of SPLs. The approach works with MOEAs and two selection methods, random and based on FRR-MAB (Fitness Rate Rank based Multi-Armed Bandit). It was evaluated with real FMs and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional algorithms used in the literature, and that both selection methods present similar performance.},

abstract = {In distributed software product line projects, dependencies between components influence on communication and coordination needs among their respective development teams. As an alternative to reduce such needs, it seems interesting to cluster tightly-coupled components into loosely-coupled modules as long as each module is developed by a single team. In such a context, considering that numerous clustering possibilities exist, this paper presents a quantitative, evidence-based approach for recommending software modules by clustering software components. The proposed approach has a threefold foundation: quantitative measures that characterize dependencies between components; a search-based clustering algorithm to recommend modules; and a quantitative measure that characterize dependencies between modules, which can guide the allocation of development teams to modules.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) aims at developing a large number of software systems that share a common and managed set of features [5]. In the past years, it has been an active area in both research and industry. SPLE aims at improving productivity and reducing the time, effort, and cost required to develop a family of products (also called variants). The key point to achieve this goal is to manage the variability among various products of a Software Product Line (SPL). Variability is commonly expressed in terms of features, i.e., units of difference between software products. A product can thus be viewed as a set of features. Dependencies between features are typically represented in a Feature Model (FM) [11], whose ultimate purpose is to define which combinations of features (that is, which products) are valid [16]. Behavior of both the features and the core behavior (i.e., the behavior shared by all products in the line) may be represented by (variants of) state machines [3, 13].},

abstract = {Feature-oriented software development is a software development paradigm that uses "features" as the first class objects in designing program instead of objects as with the object-orientation. Most of researches on feature-oriented software development attempt to derive program code directly from a feature model, which presents several problems: there is no explicit attempt to embed required quality attributes into code; and features tend to cut across program units and it is difficult to derive program units from the features. To address these problems, a design-feature-based approach is proposed in this paper. Design feature model captures implementation-level design decisions explicitly. It bridges the abstraction gap between features (i.e., functionalities in abstraction) and program units (i.e., concrete implementation). Design features of a design feature model are identified based on required quality attributes. We demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed approach by providing a case study of an arcade game software product line. Initial lessons learned and research agenda are also introduced in the paper.},

Our approach consists of constructing a feature dependency model for describing variability in multiplatform video games. We explored variability in the user interface, input devices, output devices, CPU, as well as other variability in various video game platforms. Then, we designed a variable component-based SPL that is tailored to every video game in the product line. We validated our approach by implementing a SPL of a combat flight-simulator game and by deriving two versions of the game: a Windows desktop version and a Windows Phone version. The derivation process of each version is done by selecting features from the feature dependency model and the corresponding software components and SPL parameters that relate to those features.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a family of related programs of a domain. The programs of an SPL are distinguished in terms of features, which are end-user visible characteristics of programs. Based on a selection of features, stakeholders can derive tailor-made programs that satisfy functional requirements. Besides functional requirements, different application scenarios raise the need for optimizing non-functional properties of a variant. The diversity of application scenarios leads to heterogeneous optimization goals with respect to non-functional properties (e.g., performance vs. footprint vs. energy optimized variants). Hence, an SPL has to satisfy different and sometimes contradicting requirements regarding non-functional properties. Usually, the actually required non-functional properties are not known before product derivation and can vary for each application scenario and customer. Allowing stakeholders to derive optimized variants requires us to measure non-functional properties after the SPL is developed. Unfortunately, the high variability provided by SPLs complicates measurement and optimization of non-functional properties due to a large variant space. With SPL Conqueror, we provide a holistic approach to optimize non-functional properties in SPL engineering. We show how non-functional properties can be qualitatively specified and quantitatively measured in the context of SPLs. Furthermore, we discuss the variant-derivation process in SPL Conqueror that reduces the effort of computing an optimal variant. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by means of nine case studies of a broad range of application domains (e.g., database management and operating systems). Moreover, we show that SPL Conqueror is implementation and language independent by using SPLs that are implemented with different mechanisms, such as conditional compilation and feature-oriented programming.},

abstract = {Configurable software systems are software systems that can be adapted or configured according to a set of features with the goal of increasing reuse and productivity. However, testing configurable systems is very challenging due to the number of configurations to run with each test, leading to a combinatorial explosion in the number of configurations and tests. Currently, several testing techniques and tools have been proposed to deal with this challenge, but their potential practical application remains mostly unexplored. The lack of studies to explore the tools that apply those techniques motivated us to investigate the literature to find testing tools for configurable software systems and to understand how they work. In this paper, we conducted a systematic mapping and identified 34 testing tools for configurable software systems. We first summarized and discussed their main characteristics. We then designed and performed a comparative empirical study of the main sound testing tools found: VarexJ and SPLat. They are considered sound testing techniques because they explore all reachable configurations from a given test. Overall, we observed that VarexJ and SPLat presented distinct results for efficiency while testing the target systems and that, although VarexJ found more errors than SPLat for the majority of the target systems, such result deserves a more in-depth investigation because we expected a higher intersection of errors encountered by them.},

Approach: We enriched a quasi-experimental design with a variety of methods found in case study research. A sample of 258 students was employed with data collection and analysis based on a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Our study was performed in two phases: the first phase focused on variability identification and instantiation, while the second phase included tasks on variability evolution. Results: We obtained strong empirical evidence on reuse patterns for rationale during instantiation and evolution of variability. The tabular representations used by rationale modeling are learnable and usable in teams of diverse backgrounds.},

To reduce complexity and improve understandability of such systems, models represent specific views on the system. These views have semantic interrelations (e.g., by sharing common or dependent information) that need to be kept consistent during evolution of the system. Apart from that, modern systems need to run in many different contexts and be highly configurable to satisfy the demand for fully customizable products. Such variable systems often comprise various dependencies from which inconsistencies may arise. Combining solutions for consistency management with variants and versions management, however, comes with many challenges.In this research-in-progress paper, we introduce the VaVe approach which makes variants and versions management aware of automated consistency preservation in the context of multi-view modeling. We explain core features of the approach and reason about its benefits and limitations.},

abstract = {The Exception Handling (EH) is a widely used mechanism for building robust systems and it is embedded in most of the mainstream programming languages. In the context of Software Product Lines (SPL), we can find exception handling code associated to common and variable features of an SPL. However, studies have shown that the exception handling code can also become a source of bugs which may affect the system the other way around, making it even less robust. This paper describes an empirical study whose goal was to investigate the evolutionary nature of exception handling violations. Can the exception handling behavior be preserved along SPL evolution scenarios? In order to carry out this study we extended a tool, called PLEA, which statically discovers the exception handling flows on SPLs (those implemented in Java and using annotation techniques), and it was executed over five to seven versions of two distinct SPLs. Our goal was to identify how the different kinds of evolution scenarios affected the exception handling policy initially defined. The results showed that the evolution of the SPLs exception handling code did not occur in a planned way in most of the scenarios. Consequently, it led to violations on the exception handling behavior. This paper points out the need of a set of EH behavior-preserving evolution scenarios for the SPLs exception handling code.},

abstract = {Optimizing the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) options in order to get the best performance out of a program for production is a challenging and time-consuming task. HotSpot, the Oracle's open-source Java VM implementation offers more than 500 options, called flags, that can be used to tune the JVM's compiler, garbage collector (GC), heap size and much more. In addition to being numerous, these flags are sometimes poorly documented and create a need of benchmarking to ensure that the flags and their associated values deliver the best performance and stability for a particular program to execute.Auto-tuning approaches have already been proposed in order to mitigate this burden. However, in spite of increasingly sophisticated search techniques allowing for powerful optimizations, these approaches take little account of the underlying complexities of JVM flags. Indeed, dependencies and incompatibilities between flags are non-trivial to express, which if not taken into account may lead to invalid or spurious flag configurations that should not be considered by the auto-tuner.In this paper, we propose a novel model, inspired by the feature model used in Software Product Line, which takes the complexity of JVM's flags into account. We then demonstrate the usefulness of this model, using it as an input of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize the execution times of DaCapo Benchmarks.},

abstract = {Variability models are used to build configurators, for guiding users through the configuration process to reach the desired setting that fulfils user requirements. The same variability model can be used to design different configurators employing different techniques. One of the design options that can change in a configurator is the configuration workflow, i.e., the order and sequence in which the different configuration elements are presented to the configuration stakeholders. When developing a configurator, a challenge is to decide the configuration workflow that better suits stakeholders according to previous configurations. For example, when configuring a Linux distribution the configuration process starts by choosing the network or the graphic card and then, other packages concerning a given sequence. In this paper, we present COnfiguration workfLOw proceSS mIning (COLOSSI), a framework that can automatically assist determining the configuration workflow that better fits the configuration logs generated by user activities given a set of logs of previous configurations and a variability model. COLOSSI is based on process discovery, commonly used in the process mining area, with an adaptation to configuration contexts. Derived from the possible complexity of both logs and the discovered processes, often, it is necessary to divide the traces into small ones. This provides an easier configuration workflow to be understood and followed by the user during the configuration process. In this paper, we apply and compare four different techniques for the traces clustering: greedy, backtracking, genetic and hierarchical algorithms. Our proposal is validated in three different scenarios, to show its feasibility, an ERP configuration, a Smart Farming, and a Computer Configuration. Furthermore, we open the door to new applications of process mining techniques in different areas of software product line engineering along with the necessity to apply clustering techniques for the trace preparation in the context of configuration workflows.},

abstract = {In software product line engineering, a feature model represents the possible configuration space and can be customized based on the stakeholders' needs. Considering the complexity of feature models in addition to the diversity of the stake-holders' expectations, the configuration process is viewed as a complex optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a holistic approach for the configuration process that seeks to satisfy the stakeholders' requirements as well as the feature models' structural and integrity constraints. Here, we model stakeholders' functional and non-functional needs and their preferences using requirement engineering goal models. We formalize the structure of the feature model, the stake-holders' objectives, and their preferences in the form of an integer linear program to automatically perform feature selection.},

abstract = {A self-adaptive service can maintain its QoS requirements in the presence of dynamic environment changes. To develop a self-adaptive service, service engineers have to create self-adaptation logic encoding when the service should execute which adaptation actions. However, developing self-adaptation logic may be difficult due to design time uncertainty; e.g., anticipating all potential environment changes at design time is in most cases infeasible. Online reinforcement learning addresses design time uncertainty by learning suitable adaptation actions through interactions with the environment at runtime. To learn more about its environment, reinforcement learning has to select actions that were not selected before, which is known as exploration. How exploration happens has an impact on the performance of the learning process. We focus on two problems related to how a service’s adaptation actions are explored: (1) Existing solutions randomly explore adaptation actions and thus may exhibit slow learning if there are many possible adaptation actions to choose from. (2) Existing solutions are unaware of service evolution, and thus may explore new adaptation actions introduced during such evolution rather late. We propose novel exploration strategies that use feature models (from software product line engineering) to guide exploration in the presence of many adaptation actions and in the presence of service evolution. Experimental results for a self-adaptive cloud management service indicate an average speed-up of the learning process of 58.8% in the presence of many adaptation actions, and of 61.3% in the presence of service evolution. The improved learning performance in turn led to an average QoS improvement of 7.8% and 23.7% respectively

abstract = {Agile methods and product line engineering (PLE) have both proven successful in increasing customer satisfaction and decreasing time to market under certain conditions. Key characteristics of agile methods are lean and highly iterative development with a strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement. PLE leverages reuse through systematic approaches such as variability modeling or product derivation. Integrating agile approaches with product line engineering is an interesting proposition which - not surprisingly - entails several challenges: Product lines (PL) rely on complex plans and models to ensure their long-term evolution while agile methods emphasize simplicity and short-term value-creation for customers. When incorporating agility in product line engineering, it is thus essential to define carefully how agile principles can support particular PLE processes. For instance, the processes of defining and setting up a product line (domain engineering) and deriving products (application engineering) differ significantly in practices and focus with implications on the suitability of agile principles. This paper presents practical experiences of adopting agile principles in product line planning (a domain engineering activity). ThinkLets, i.e., collaborative practices from the area of collaboration engineering, are the building blocks of the presented approach as they codify agile principles such as stakeholder involvement, rapid feedback, or value-based prioritization. We discuss how our approach balances agility and the intrinsic needs of product line planning. A case study carried out with an industrial partner indicates that the approach is practicable, usable, and useful.},

abstract = {A company's architecture knowledge is often personalized across specific people that share experience and knowledge in the field. However, this knowledge may be important for other stakeholders. Omitting the codification of the architecture knowledge may result in ad-hoc practices, which is particularly relevant for software evolution. In a collaboration with Egemin, an industrial manufacturer of logistic systems, we faced the problem with a lack of codified architecture knowledge in the context of the evolution of a software product line (SPL). In particular, maintainers lack the architecture knowledge that is needed to perform the evolution tasks of deployed products correctly and efficiently. Ad-hoc updates increase costs and harm the company's reputation. To address this problem, we developed an automated approach for evolving deployed systems of a SPL. Central in this approach are (1) a meta-model that codifies the architecture knowledge required to support evolution of a SPL, and (2) and algorithm that uses the architecture knowledge harvested from a deployed system based on the meta-model to generate the list of tasks maintainers have to perform to evolve the system. Evaluation of the approach demonstrates a significant improvement of the quality of system updates with respect to the correct execution of updates and the availability of services during the updates.},

abstract = {ContextSearch-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is an emerging discipline that focuses on the application of search-based optimization techniques to software engineering problems. Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software systems whose members are distinguished by the set of features each one provides. SPL development practices have proven benefits such as improved software reuse, better customization, and faster time to market. A typical SPL usually involves a large number of systems and features, a fact that makes them attractive for the application of SBSE techniques which are able to tackle problems that involve large search spaces. ObjectiveThe main objective of our work is to identify the quantity and the type of research on the application of SBSE techniques to SPL problems. More concretely, the SBSE techniques that have been used and at what stage of the SPL life cycle, the type of case studies employed and their empirical analysis, and the fora where the research has been published. MethodA systematic mapping study was conducted with five research questions and assessed 77 publications from 2001, when the term SBSE was coined, until 2014. ResultsThe most common application of SBSE techniques found was testing followed by product configuration, with genetic algorithms and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms being the two most commonly used techniques. Our study identified the need to improve the robustness of the empirical evaluation of existing research, a lack of extensive and robust tool support, and multiple avenues worthy of further investigation. ConclusionsOur study attested the great synergy existing between both fields, corroborated the increasing and ongoing interest in research on the subject, and revealed challenging open research questions.},

abstract = {Context. From recent works on product properties resulting from configurations and the optimisation of these properties, one comes quickly to more complex challenges such as multi-objective optimisation, conflicting objectives, multiple stakeholders, and conflict resolution. The intuition is that Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) can draw from other disciplines that deal with decision spaces and complex decision scenarios.Objectives. We aim to (1) explore links to such disciplines, (2) systematise and compare concepts, and (3) identify opportunities, where SPLE approaches can be enriched.Method. We undertake an exploratory study: Starting from common SPLE activities and artefacts, we identify aspects where we expect to find corresponding counterparts in other disciplines. We focus on Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO), and Design Space Exploration (DSE), and perform a comparison of the key concepts.Results. The resulting comparison relates SPLE activities and artefacts to concepts from MCDA, MOO, and DSE and identifies areas where SPLE approaches can be enriched. We also provide examples of existing work at the intersections of SPLE with the other fields. These findings are aimed to foster the conversation on research opportunities where SPLE can draw techniques from other disciplines dealing with complex decision scenarios.},

An SPL can be extracted from one single product or from a family of related software products, and feature location strategies are widely used for variability mining. Several feature location strategies have been proposed in the literature and they usually aim to map a feature to its source code implementation. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review that identifies and characterizes existing feature location strategies. We also evaluated three different strategies based on textual information retrieval in the context of the ArgoUML-SPL feature location case study. In this evaluation, we compare the strategies based on their ability to correctly identify the source code of several features from ArgoUML-SPL ground truth. We then discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each feature location strategy.},

Only few aim to handle SPL evolution, but even those lack support of variability reverse engineering, which is necessary for migrating product copies to a product line. In this paper, we present our continued concept on using component architecture information to enhance a variability reverse engineering process.

This detection is similar to the retest test-case selection problem in regression testing, where change impact analysis is applied to reason about changed dependencies to be retested. In this paper, we propose automated change impact analysis based on incremental model slicing for incremental SPL testing. Incremental slicing allows for a slice computation by adapting a previous slice with explicit derivation of their differences by taking model changes into account. We apply incremental slicing to determine the impact of applied model changes and to reason about their potential retest. Based on our novel retest coverage criterion, each slice change specifies a retest test goal to be covered by existing test cases selected for retesting. We prototypically implemented our approach and evaluated its applicability and effectiveness by means of four SPLs.},

abstract = {Numerous software product lines today are built from components supplied by different vendors. Companies situated in the middle of a software supply chain must configure and integrate components from their suppliers and offer (partially configured) variants for their customers, who can then complete the configuration and use these components in product lines or products that they develop. Covering the entire product line often involves using components from multiple suppliers, many of which providing overlapping functionality. This leads to a product line with different possible alternatives for components. These components may use mismatched interfaces and therefore require glue for integration.In this paper we analyze the consequences of combining heterogeneous components -- components that are not designed using a common architecture -- in a product line. We describe the limitations of the current practice and the challenges that arise from combining such components and delivering partially configured products. We introduce a new variability pattern that allows us to deal with heterogeneous components implementing overlapping functionality. This pattern consists of a reference architectural model, as well as transformations that generate a partially configured application including artifacts for gluing mismatched components.},

Visualisation is widely used in software engineering and has proven useful to amplify human cognition in data intensive applications. Adopting this technique in software product line engineering can help stakeholders in supporting essential work tasks and in enhancing their understanding of large and complex product lines.The research presented in this paper describes an integrated meta-model and research tool that employs visualisation techniques to address significant software product line tasks such as variability management and product derivation. Examples of the tasks are described and the ways in which these tasks can be further supported by utilising visualisation techniques are explained.},

abstract = {SIGTel is a SME aimed at developing WebGIS application. It has a portfolio of products which are a combination of Open GIS components and its own developed components. Although most of these products share a common architecture and common features, they have to be customized according to the user requirements. Now, this SME is working at the improvement of the software development process by introducing a Software Product Line (SPL) approach to automate the process of development and deployment based on that common architecture, as well as reduce time to market and improve quality. The first step has been taken, and KobrA approach has been chosen as the basic methodology to start working. Now, the on-going work is to perform the Domain Engineering, being the management of variability one of the first issues to be resolved. Here, we present a combination of KobrA containment tree and Orthogonal Variation Model (OVM), as the selected alternative to model the variability by using the architecture of our WebGIS SPL.},

abstract = {A robot is essentially a real-time, distributed embedded system operating in a physical environment. Often, control and communication paths within the system are tightly coupled to the actual hardware configuration of the robot. Furthermore, the domain contains a high amount of variability on different levels, ranging from hardware, over software to the environment in which the robot is operated. Today, special robots are used in households to perform monotonous and recurring tasks like vacuuming or mowing the lawn. In the future there may be robots that can be configured and programmed for more complicated tasks, like washing dishes or cleaning up or to assist elderly people. Nowadays, programming a robot is a highly complex and challenging task, which can be carried out only by programmers with dedicated background in robotics. Societal acceptance of robots can only be achieved, if they are easy to program. In this paper we present our approach to provide customized programming environments enabling programmers without background knowledge in robotics to specify robot programs. Our solution was realized using product line techniques.},

abstract = {Product line engineering is a recent approach to software development that has shown to enable organizations to achieve significant reductions in development and maintenance cost as well as time-to-market of increasingly complex software systems. Yet, the testing process has not kept up with these reductions and the relative cost for testing product lines is actually becoming higher than in traditional single system development. Also, testing often cannot keep pace with accelerated development in product line engineering due to technical and organizational issues. This paper advocates that testing of product lines can be made more efficient and effective by considering testability already during architectural design. It explores the relationship between testability and product line architecture and discusses the importance of high testability for reducing product line testing effort and achieving required coverage criteria. The paper also outlines a systematic approach that will support product line organizations in improving and evaluating testability of product lines at the architectural level.},

abstract = {Product Line Engineering (PLE) is expected to enhance quality and productivity, speed up time-to-market and decrease development effort, through reuse—the key mechanism of PLE. In addition, one can also apply PLE to support systematic testing and more specifically model-based testing (MBT) of product lines—the original motivation behind this work. MBT has shown to be cost-effective in many industry sectors but at the expense of building models of the system under test (SUT). However, the modeling effort to support MBT can significantly be reduced if an adequate product line modeling and configuration methodology is followed, which is the main motivation of this paper. The initial motivation for this work emerged while working with MBT for a Video Conferencing product line at Cisco Systems, Norway. In this paper, we report on our experience in modeling product family models and various types of behavioral variability in the Saturn product line. We focus on behavioral variability in UML state machines since the Video Conferencing Systems (VCSs) exhibit strong state-based behavior and these models are the main drivers for MBT; however, the approach can be also tailored to other UML diagrams. We also provide a mechanism to specify and configure various types of variability using stereotypes and Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM). Results of applying our methodology to the Saturn product line modeling and configuration process show that the effort required for modeling and configuring products of the product line family can be significantly reduced.},

Our focus of product evolution is on the tasks integrators have to perform to update deployed SPL products with minimal interruption of services. In case of Egemin, our industrial partner, the updates of SPL products is further hampered as a consequence of outdated and imprecise architectural knowledge of deployed products. To facilitate the updates of products, we have developed the architecture-centric approach which comprises two complementary parts: an update viewpoint and a supporting tool. In this paper we present an evaluation of the architecture-centric approach. The approach is compared with the Egemin's current update approach in a controlled experiment. In the experiment 17 professionals were asked to perform 68 updates of logistic systems. The results obtained from the experiment show that the architecture-centric approach significantly improves the correctness of updates and reduces the interruption of services during updates of Egemin's SPL products.},

We propose the usage of a domain-specific language named CoCo to specify attributes as non-functional properties of features, and to describe business-related decision rules in terms of costs, time, and human resources. These specifications along with the stakeholders' configurations and the feature model are transformed into a constraint programming problem, on which decision rules are executed to find a non-conflicting set of solution configurations that are aligned to business objectives. We evaluate CoCo's compositionality and model complexity simplification while using a set of motivating decision scenarios.},

abstract = {Context: A software product line is a family of related software products, typically created from a set of common assets. Users select features to derive a product that fulfills their needs. Users often expect a product to have specific non-functional properties, such as a small footprint or a bounded response time. Because a product line may have an exponential number of products with respect to its features, it is usually not feasible to generate and measure non-functional properties for each possible product. Objective: Our overall goal is to derive optimal products with respect to non-functional requirements by showing customers which features must be selected. Method: We propose an approach to predict a product's non-functional properties based on the product's feature selection. We aggregate the influence of each selected feature on a non-functional property to predict a product's properties. We generate and measure a small set of products and, by comparing measurements, we approximate each feature's influence on the non-functional property in question. As a research method, we conducted controlled experiments and evaluated prediction accuracy for the non-functional properties footprint and main-memory consumption. But, in principle, our approach is applicable for all quantifiable non-functional properties. Results: With nine software product lines, we demonstrate that our approach predicts the footprint with an average accuracy of 94%, and an accuracy of over 99% on average if feature interactions are known. In a further series of experiments, we predicted main memory consumption of six customizable programs and achieved an accuracy of 89% on average. Conclusion: Our experiments suggest that, with only few measurements, it is possible to accurately predict non-functional properties of products of a product line. Furthermore, we show how already little domain knowledge can improve predictions and discuss trade-offs between accuracy and required number of measurements. With this technique, we provide a basis for many reasoning and product-derivation approaches.},

This study explores an approach to automating test case definition in the context of applying a model driven approach to the development of a software product line. In this study, test cases are automatically extracted from use cases, which are specified using a domain specific language (DSL). DSLs are easier for domain experts to use than formal specification languages and are more narrowly focused than natural languages making it easier to build tools. The task is further simplified by restricting the DSL to the scope of the software product line under development. The structure of the DSL and proven patterns of test design provide the clues necessary to be able to automatically extract the test cases. A chain of model-driven tools is used to automate the system test process, which begins with a use case model and ends with automatic execution of system tests.},

Correspondingly, a large number of advanced techniques and algorithms have been developed in academia and industry to support different aspects of configuration reasoning. While traditional research in the field focused on the configuration of physical artefacts, recognition of the business value of customizable software products led to the emergence of software product line engineering. Despite the significant overlap in research interests, the two fields mainly evolved in isolation. Only limited attempts were made at combining the approaches developed in the different fields. In this paper, we first aim to give an overview of commonalities and differences between software product line engineering and product configuration. We then identify opportunities for cross-fertilization between these fields and finally develop a research agenda to combine their respective techniques. Ultimately, this should lead to a unified configuration approach.},

The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, we describe collaboration modes, factors that were critical to sustain collaboration, and benefits for university and industry gained over years. Among the main benefits, STEE-InfoSoft advanced its reuse practice by applying XVCL in several software Product Line projects, while NUS team received early feedback from STEE-InfoSoft which helped refine XVCL reuse methods and keep academic research in sync with industrial realities. Academic findings and industrial pilots have opened new unexpected research directions. Second, we draw lessons learned from many projects, to explain the general nature and significance of problems addressed with the XVCL approach.},

abstract = {Architecture-level business services are identified based on business processes; and likewise, in service-oriented product lines, identifying the domain architecture-level business services and their variability is preferred to be based on business processes and their variability. Identification of business services for a product line satisfying a set of given design metrics (such as cohesion and coupling) is extremely difficult for a domain architect, since there are many product configurations for which the services must be proper at the same time. This means that the identified services must have proper values for n metrics in m different configurations at the same time. The problem becomes more serious when there are high degrees of variability and complexity embedded in the business processes that are the basis for service identification.We contribute to solve the multi-objective optimization problem of identifying business services for a product line by partitioning the graph of a business process variability model utilizing Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II. The service specification is achieved based on the results of the partitioning. The variability of the services is then determined in terms of mandatory and optional services as well as variability relationships, which are all represented in a Service Variability Model. The method was empirically evaluated through experimentation, and showed proper levels of reusability and variability. Furthermore, the resulting models were fully consistent.},

abstract = {The automated analysis of feature models (FM) is based on SAT, BDD, and CSP - known NP-complete problems. Therefore, the analysis could have an exponential worst-case execution time. However, for many practical relevant analysis cases, state-of-the-art (SOTA) analysis tools quite successfully master the problem of exponential worst-case execution time based on heuristics. So far, however, very little is known about the structure of FMs that cause the cases in which the execution time (hardness) for analyzing a given FM increases unpredictably for SOTA analysis tools. In this paper, we propose to use width measures from graph theory to characterize the structural complexity of FMs as a basis for an estimation of the hardness of analysis operations on FMs with SOTA analysis tools. We present an experiment that we use to analyze the reasonability of graph width measures as metric for the structural complexity of FMs and the hardness of FM analysis. Such a complexity metric can be used as a basis for a unified method to systematically improve SOTA analysis tools.},

While the foundations of this domain recently made significant progress with the introduction of Featured Transition Systems (FTSs) and associated algorithms, SPL model checking still faces the well-known state explosion problem. Moreover, there is a need for high-level specification languages usable in industry. We address the state explosion problem by applying the principles of symbolic model checking to FTS-based verification of SPLs. In order to specify properties on specific products only, we extend the temporal logic CTL with feature quantifiers. Next, we show how SPL behaviour can be specified with fSMV, a variant of SMV, the specification language of the industry-strength model checker NuSMV. fSMV is a feature-oriented extension of SMV originally introduced by Plath and Ryan. We prove that fSMV and FTSs are expressively equivalent. Finally, we connect these results to a NuSMV extension we developed for verifying SPLs against CTL properties. We use Featured Transition Systems (FTS) to model Software Product Lines (SPLs).We design symbolic algorithms for checking an FTS against temporal properties.We give a new compositional formal semantics to the fSMV language.We prove the expressiveness equivalence between fSMV and FTS.We evaluate practical implications of our results through our toolset and case study.},

Features can also facilitate the analysis of families of systems by exploiting commonalities of the family members and performing an all-in-one analysis, where all systems of the family are analyzed at once on a single family model instead of one-by-one. Most prominent, the concept of features has been successfully applied to describe and analyze (software) product lines. We present the tool ProFeat that supports the feature-oriented engineering process for stochastic systems by probabilistic model checking. To describe families of stochastic systems, ProFeat extends models for the prominent probabilistic model checker Prism by feature-oriented concepts, including support for probabilistic product lines with dynamic feature switches, multi-features and feature attributes. ProFeat provides a compact symbolic representation of the analysis results for each family member obtained by Prism to support, e.g., model repair or refinement during feature-oriented development. By means of several case studies we show how ProFeat eases family-based quantitative analysis and compare one-by-one and all-in-one analysis approaches.},

Quality attributes are an important issue to consider in embedded software development where time issues may be critical. Development paradigms such as Model Driven Development and Software Product Lines can be an adequate alternative to traditional software development and validation methods due to the characteristics of embedded systems. But for a proper validation and verification based on MARTE model analysis, all variability issues and critical quality attributes that take part in analysis must be properly modelled and managed. Therefore, a model analysis process for Model Driven Embedded Software Product Lines has been defined as some process lacks have been found.},

abstract = {Systematic exploration of hypotheses is a major part of any empirical research. In software engineering, we often produce unique tools for experiments and evaluate them independently on different data sets. In this paper, we present KernelHaven as an experimentation workbench supporting a significant number of experiments in the domain of static product line analysis and verification. It addresses the need for extracting information from a variety of artifacts in this domain by means of an open plug-in infrastructure. Available plug-ins encapsulate existing tools, which can now be combined efficiently to yield new analyses. As an experimentation workbench, it provides configuration-based definitions of experiments, their documentation, and technical services, like parallelization and caching. Hence, researchers can abstract from technical details and focus on the algorithmic core of their research problem.KernelHaven supports different types of analyses, like correctness checks, metrics, etc., in its specific domain. The concepts presented in this paper can also be transferred to support researchers of other software engineering domains. The infrastructure is available under Apache 2.0: https://github.com/KernelHaven. The plug-ins are available under their individual licenses.Video: https://youtu.be/IbNc-H1NoZU},

abstract = {Delta-oriented programming (DOP) is a modular, yet flexible approach to implement software product lines. In DOP, a product line is implemented by a set of deltas, which are containers of modifications to a program. A delta-oriented product line is specified by its code base, i.e., the set of delta modules, and a product line declaration specifying the set of possible product variants. In this paper, we present DOP for Java 1.5 extending previous proof-of-concept realizations of DOP for simple core Java-like languages. The novel prototypical implementation DeltaJ 1.5 provides full integrated access to the object-oriented features of Java. The extensions include delta operations to fully integrate the Java package system, to declare and modify interfaces, to explicitly change the inheritance hierarchy, to access nested types and enum types, to alter field declarations, and to unambiguously remove overloaded methods. Furthermore, we improve the specification of the product line declaration by providing a separate language. We have evaluated DeltaJ 1.5 using a case study.},

It is even less so, if it is done under tight technology constraints in an embedded environment. It becomes even more difficult if the transition directly aims at integrating two product families into a single product population. In this paper, we discuss our experiences with a project where we successfully dealt with these difficulties and achieved a successful product line transition. In our paper we strongly emphasize the role of technology transfer, as many facets of product line know-how had to be transferred to guarantee a complete transition to product line engineering. From the experiences of this project many lessons learned can be deduced, which can be transferred to different environments.},

abstract = {Quality assurance is an important issue in product line engineering. It is commonly agreed that quality assurance in domain engineering requires special attention, since a defect in a domain artifact can affect several products of a product line and can lead to high costs for defect correction. However, the variability in domain artifacts is a special challenge for quality assurance, since quality assurance approaches from single system engineering cannot handle the variability in domain artifacts. Therefore, the adaptation of existing approaches or the development of new approaches is necessary to support quality assurance in domain engineering.Activity diagrams are a widely accepted modeling language used to support quality assurance activities in single system engineering. However, current quality assurance approaches adapted for product line engineering using activity diagrams are not based on a formal syntax and semantics and therefore techniques based on these approaches are only automatable to a limited extent. In this paper, we propose a formal syntax and semantics for documenting variability in activity diagrams based on Petri-nets which provide the foundation for an automated support of quality assurance in domain engineering.},

However, high levels of quality in the software product line assets, which are used to create products, must be accompanied by effective and efficient test strategies for the products in the software product line. The goal of this study is to understand which strategies for testing products in software product lines have been reported in the literature, enabling discussions on the significant issues, and also pointing out further research directions. A systematic literature review was carried out that identified two hundred seventy-three papers, published from the years 1998 and early in 2012. From such a set of papers, a systematic selection resulted in forty-one relevant papers. The analysis of the reported strategies comprised two important aspects: the selection of products for testing, and the actual test of products. The findings showed a range of strategies, dealing with both aspects, but few empirical evaluations of their effectiveness have been performed, which limits the inferences that can be drawn.},

However, search-based PLA design is an incipient research field. Due to this, works in this field have addressed main points to solve the problem: adequate representation, specific search operators and suitable evaluation fitness functions. Similarly what happens in the search-based design of traditional software, existing works on search-based PLA design use NSGA-II, without evaluating the characteristics of this algorithm, such as the use of crossover operator. Considering this fact, this paper reports results from a comparative analysis of two algorithms, NSGA-II and PAES, to the PLA design problem. PAES was chosen because it implements a different evolution strategy that does not employ crossover. An experimental study was carried out with nine PLAs and results of the conducted study attest that NSGA-II performs better than PAES in the PLA design context.},

abstract = {Today's software systems are often customizable by means of load-time or compile-time configuration options. These options are typically not independent and their dependencies can be specified by means of feature models. As many industrial systems contain thousands of options, the maintenance and utilization of feature models is a challenge for all stakeholders. In the last two decades, numerous approaches have been presented to support stakeholders in analyzing feature models. Such analyses are commonly reduced to satisfiability problems, which suffer from the growing number of options. While first attempts have been made to decompose feature models into smaller parts, they still require to compose all parts for analysis. We propose the concept of a feature-model interface that only consists of a subset of features, typically selected by experts, and hides all other features and dependencies. Based on a formalization of feature-model interfaces, we prove compositionality properties. We evaluate feature-model interfaces using a three-month history of an industrial feature model from the automotive domain with 18,616 features. Our results indicate performance benefits especially under evolution as often only parts of the feature model need to be analyzed again.},

abstract = {Context: Testing plays an important role in the quality assurance process for software product line engineering. There are many opportunities for economies of scope and scale in the testing activities, but techniques that can take advantage of these opportunities are still needed. Objective: The objective of this study is to identify testing strategies that have the potential to achieve these economies, and to provide a synthesis of available research on SPL testing strategies, to be applied towards reaching higher defect detection rates and reduced quality assurance effort. Method: We performed a literature review of two hundred seventy-six studies published from the year 1998 up to the 1st semester of 2013. We used several filters to focus the review on the most relevant studies and we give detailed analyses of the core set of studies. Results: The analysis of the reported strategies comprised two fundamental aspects for software product line testing: the selection of products for testing, and the actual test of products. Our findings indicate that the literature offers a large number of techniques to cope with such aspects. However, there is a lack of reports on realistic industrial experiences, which limits the inferences that can be drawn. Conclusion: This study showed a number of leveraged strategies that can support both the selection of products, and the actual testing of products. Future research should also benefit from the problems and advantages identified in this study.},

We have thus been developing a flexible and extensible approach for defining product line variability models. Its main purposes are to guide stakeholders through product derivation and to automatically generate product configurations. Our approach is supported by the DOPLER (  D ecision-  O riented  P roduct  L ine  E ngineering for effective  R euse) meta-tool that allows modelers to specify the types of reusable assets, their attributes, and dependencies for their specific system and context. The aim of this paper is to investigate the suitability of our approach for different domains. More specifically, we explored two research questions regarding the implementation of variability and the utility of DOPLER for variability modeling in different domains. We conducted a multiple case study consisting of four cases in the domains of industrial automation systems and business software. In each of these case studies we analyzed variability implementation techniques. Experts from our industry partners then developed domain-specific meta-models, tool extensions, and variability models for their product lines using DOPLER. The four cases demonstrate the flexibility of the DOPLER approach and the extensibility and adaptability of the supporting meta tool.},

Software product line engineering is a means to systematically manage variability and commonality in software systems, enabling the automated synthesis of related programs (products) from a set of reusable assets. However, the number of products in a software product line may grow exponentially with the number of features, so it is practically infeasible to quality-check each of these products in isolation. There is a number of variability-aware approaches to product-line analysis that adapt single-product analysis techniques to cope with variability in an efficient way. Such approaches can be classified along three analysis dimensions (product-based, family-based, and feature-based), but, particularly in the context of reliability analysis, there is no theory comprising both (a) a formal specification of the three dimensions and resulting analysis strategies and (b) proof that such analyses are equivalent to one another. The lack of such a theory hinders formal reasoning on the relationship between the analysis dimensions and derived analysis techniques. We formalize seven approaches to reliability analysis of product lines, including the first instance of a feature-family-product-based analysis in the literature. We prove the formalized analysis strategies to be sound with respect to the probabilistic approach to reliability analysis of a single product. Furthermore, we present a commuting diagram of intermediate analysis steps, which relates different strategies and enables the reuse of soundness proofs between them.},

abstract = {Traceability is the ability to describe and follow the life of a software artifact and a means for modeling the relations between software artifacts in an explicit way. Traceability has been successfully applied in many software engineering communities and has recently been adopted to document the transition among requirements, architecture and implementation. We present an approach to customize traceability to the situation at hand. Instead of automating tracing, or representing all possible traces, we scope the traces to be maintained to the activities stakeholders must carry out. We define core traceability paths, consisting of essential traceability links required to support the activities. We illustrate the approach through two examples: product derivation in software product lines, and release planning in software process management. By using a running software product line example, we explain why the core traceability paths identified are needed when navigating from feature to structural models and from family to product level and backward between models used in software product derivation. A feasibility study in release planning carried out in an industrial setting further illustrates the use of core traceability paths during production and measures the increase in performance of the development processes supported by our approach. These examples show that our approach can be successfully used to support both product and process traceability in a pragmatic yet efficient way.},

The main challenge is selecting valid features considering the constraints of the feature model. To solve this challenge, a hybrid approach is proposed to optimize the feature selection problem in software product lines. The Hybrid approach ‘Hyper-PSOBBO’ is a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Biogeography-Based Optimization (BBO) and hyper-heuristic algorithms. The proposed algorithm has been compared with Bird Swarm Algorithm (BSA), PSO, BBO, Firefly, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Hyper-heuristic. All these algorithms are performed in a set of 10 feature models that vary from a small set of 100 to a high-quality data set of 5000. The detailed empirical analysis in terms of performance has been carried out on these feature models. The results of the study indicate that the performance of the proposed method is higher to other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {In this rapidly changing world, business strategies continuously evolve to meet customers' wishes. Hence, the ability to cope with the frequent business changes is becoming important criteria of a leading development paradigm. Software product line engineering is a development paradigm based on reuse that builds a common platform from which a set of applications can be derived. Despite its advantage of enhancing time to market and costs, it is exposed to the risk of falling into the aging phenomenon because of the complexity of its evolution. In this paper the authors present a co-evolution based approach for protecting the software product lines from the aging phenomenon. The approach uses cladistics and trees reconciliation that are mainly used in biology to analyze the co-evolution between organisms. The authors' major goal is to find out changes of products that were not propagated to the common platform at the aim of reconsidering them in the platform and thus protecting it from being obsolete.},

abstract = {Requirements engineering (RE) offers the means to discover, model, and manage the requirements of the products that comprise a product line, while software product line engineering (SPLE) offers the means of realizing the products' requirements from a common base of software assets. In practice, however, RE and SPLE have proven to be less complementary than they should. While some RE techniques, particularly goal modeling, support the exploration of alternative solutions, the appropriate solution is typically conditional on context and a large product line may have many product-defining contexts. Thus, scalability and traceability through into product line features are key challenges for RE. Feature modeling, by contrast, has been widely accepted as a way of modeling commonality and variability of products of a product line that may be very complex. In this paper, we propose a goal-driven feature modeling approach that separates a feature space in terms of problem space and solution space features, and establish explicit mappings between them. This approach contributes to reducing the inherent complexity of a mixed-view feature model, deriving key engineering drivers for developing core assets of a product line, and facilitating the quality-based product configuration.},

abstract = {Many software product line testing techniques have been presented in the literature. The majority of those techniques address how to define reusable test assets (such as test models or test scenarios) in domain engineering and how to exploit those assets during application engineering. In addition to test case reuse however, the execution of test cases constitutes one important activity during application testing. Without a systematic support for the test execution in application engineering, while considering the specifics of product lines, product line artifacts might be tested redundantly. Redundant testing in application engineering, however, can lead to an increased testing effort without increasing the chance of uncovering failures. In this paper, we propose the model-based ScenTED-DF technique to avoid redundant testing in application engineering. Our technique builds on data flow-based testing techniques for single systems and adapts and extends those techniques to consider product line variability. The paper sketches the prototypical implementation of our technique to show its general feasibility and automation potential, and it describes the results of experiments using an academic product line to demonstrate that ScenTED-DF is capable of avoiding redundant tests in application engineering.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of software systems which share a common sets of feature and are developed through common set of core assets in order to promotes software reusability, mass customization, reducing cost, time-to-market and improving the quality of the product. SPLs are sets (i.e., families) of software applications developed as a whole for a specific business domain. Particular applications are derived from software families by selecting the desired features through configuration process. Traditionally, SPLs are implemented with systematically developed components, shared by members of the SPLs and reused every time a new application is derived. In this paper, we propose an approach to the development and configuration of Service-Oriented SPLs in which services are used as reusable assets and building blocks of implementation. Our proposed approach also suggests prioritization of family features according to stakeholder's non-functional requirements (NFRs) and preferences. Priorities of NFRs are used to filter the most important features of the family, which is performed by Stratified Analytic Hierarchical Process (S-AHP). The priorities also are used further for the selection of appropriate services implementation for business processes realizing features. We apply Mixed Integer Linear Programming to find the optimal service selection within the constraints boundaries specified by stakeholders.},

abstract = {The selection of products for the variability testing of Feature Models (FMs) is a complex task impacted by many factors. To solve this problem, Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully used in the field known as Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE). However, the design of a search-based approach is not an easy task for the software engineer, who can find some difficulties such as: the choice and configuration of the best MOEAs, the choice of the best search operators to be implemented, and so on. In addition to this, existing approaches are dependent on the problem domain and do not allow reuse. In this way the use of Hyper-Heuristic (HH) can help to obtain more generic and reusable search-based approaches, and because of this is considered a trend in the SBSE field. Following this trend and to contribute to reduce the software engineer's efforts, this work explores the use of a hyper-heuristic for automatic generation of MOEAs to select test products from the FM, considering three factors: pairwise coverage, mutation score and cost, given by the number of products. The HH is based on a grammar that represents the elements, parameters and components of existing MOEAs and implements evolutionary operators, such as crossover and mutation, suitable for selection problems. In this way, it can be reused for other similar software engineering problems. Evaluation results show that the proposed approach obtains results that are better or statistically equivalent than similar approaches found in the literature.},

The established practice of performance verification tests on an integrated software baseline is essential to ensure final quality of the delivered products, but is late if performance degradations already crept in. Maintenance of performance in software baselines requires an additional preventive approach. The faulty software changes that degrade performance can be identified (performance quality gates) before these changes can flow into the baseline and subsequently get rejected. This ensures that the software baseline maintains a consistent performance leading to more predictable schedules and development costs. For a complex software family involving parallel and dependent sub-projects of domain platforms and end user applications, these performance quality gates need to be established at multiple levels.},

abstract = {Feature models are a common way to represent variability requirements of software product lines by expressing the set of feature combinations that software products can have. Assuring quality of feature models is thus of paramount importance for assuring quality in software product line engineering. However, feature models can have several types of defects that disminish benefits of software product line engineering.Two of such defects are dead features and false optional features. Several state-of-the-art techniques identify these defects, but only few of them tackle the problem of identifying their causes. Besides, the explanations they provide are cumbersome and hard to understand by humans. In this paper, we propose an ontological rule-based approach to: (a) identify dead and false optional features; (b)identify certain causes of these defects; and (c) explain these causes in natural language helping modelers to correct found defects. We represent our approach with a feature model taken from literature. A preliminary empirical evaluation of our approach over 31 FMs shows that our proposal is effective, accurate and scalable to 150 features.},

What kind of bikes and docking stations are needed, how many and where to install them? How to avoid as much as possible that stations are completely empty or full for some period? Hence, a bike-sharing system can be seen both as a highly reconfigurable system and as a collective adaptive system. In this paper, we present two complementary strategies for the evaluation of bike-sharing system designs by means of automated tool support. We use the Clafer toolset to perform multi-objective optimisation of attributed feature models known from software product line engineering and the recently developed mean field model checker FlyFast to assess performance and user satisfaction aspects of variants of large-scale bike-sharing systems. The combined use of these analysis approaches is a preliminary step in the direction of automatic decision support for the initial design of a bike-sharing system as well as its successive adaptations and reconfigurations that considers both qualitative and performance aspects.},

Currently, most of existing malware detection solutions are individually proposed to address certain types of attacks or certain evasion techniques. Thus, it is desired to conduct a systematic investigation and evaluation of anti-malware solutions and tools based on different attacks and evasion techniques. In this paper, we first propose a meta model for Android malware to capture the common attack features and evasion features in the malware. Based on this model, we develop a framework, MYSTIQUE, to automatically generate malware covering four attack features and two evasion features, by adopting the software product line engineering approach. With the help of MYSTIQUE, we conduct experiments to 1) understand Android malware and the associated attack features as well as evasion techniques; 2) evaluate and compare the 57 off-the-shelf anti-malware tools, 9 academic solutions and 4 App market vetting processes in terms of accuracy in detecting attack features and capability in addressing evasion. Last but not least, we provide a benchmark of Android malware with proper labeling of contained attack and evasion features.},

Software Product Line practices can be leveraged to support the development of service-oriented applications to promote the reusability of assets throughout the iterative and incremental development of software product families. Such an approach enables various service oriented business processes and software products of the same family to be systematically created and integrated. In this paper, we advocate integration of software product line engineering with model driven engineering to enable a model driven specification of software services, capable of creating software products from a family of software services. Using the proposed method, we aim to provide a consistent view of a composed software system from a higher business administration perspective to lower levels of service implementation and deployment. We demonstrate how Model Driven Engineering (MDE) can help with injecting the set of required commonalities and variabilities of a software product from a high level business process design to the lower levels of service use.},

We present an in-depth case study on collaboration and architecture challenges in two of these large-scale software projects at Siemens. We performed a total of 46 hours of semi-structured interviews with 17 leading software architects from all involved organizational units. Our major findings are: (1) three collaboration models on a continuum that ranges from high to low coupling, (2) a classification of architecture challenges, together with (3) a qualitative and quantitative exposure of the identified recurring issues along each collaboration model. Our study results provide valuable insights for both industry and academia: Practitioners that find themselves in one of the collaboration models can use empirical evidence on challenges to make informed decisions about counteractive measures. Researchers can focus their attention on challenges faced by practitioners to make software engineering more effective.},

abstract = {A self-adaptive cyber-physical system (SACPS) can adjust its behavior and configurations at runtime in response to varying requirements obtained from the system and the environment. With the increasing use of the SACPS in different application domains, such variations are becoming more common. Users today expect the SACPS to guarantee its functional and timing behavior even in adverse environmental situations. However, uncertainties in the SACPS environment impose challenges on assuring the runtime behavior during system design.Software product line engineering (SPLE) is considered as a useful technique for handling varying requirements. In this paper, we present an approach for assuring the runtime behavior of the SACPS by applying an SPLE technique such as feature modeling. By representing the feature-based model at design time, we characterize the possible adaptation requirements to reusable configurations. The proposed approach aims to model two dynamic variability dimensions: 1) environment variability that describes the conditions under which the SACPS must adapt, and 2) structural variability, that defines the resulting architectural configurations. To validate our approach, the experimental analysis is performed using two case studies: 1) a traffic monitoring SACPS and 2) an automotive SACPS. We demonstrate that the proposed feature-based modeling approach can be used to achieve adaptivity which allows the SACPS to assure functional (defining execution of the correct set of adaptive tasks) and non-functional (defining execution of SACPS in the expected mode) correctness at runtime. The experimental results show that the feature-based SACPS demonstrates significant improvement in terms of self-configuration time, self-adaptation time and scalability with less probability of failure in different environmental situations.},

The second challenge is making sense of the data generated by multi-simulation over a model ensemble.

abstract = {Software product lines enable reuse of shared software across a family of products. As new products are built in the product line, new features are added. The features are units of functionality that provide services to users. Unwanted feature interactions, wherein one feature interferes with another feature’s operation, is a significant problem, especially as large software product lines evolve. Detecting feature interactions is a time-consuming and difficult task for developers. Moreover, feature interactions are often only discovered during testing, at which point costly re-work is needed. This paper proposes a similarity-based method to identify unwanted feature interactions much earlier in the development process. It uses knowledge of prior feature interactions stored with the software product line’s feature model to help find unwanted interactions between a new feature and existing features. The paper describes the framework and algorithms used to detect the feature interactions using three path similarity measures and evaluates the approach on a real-world, evolving software product line. Results show that the approach performs well, with 83% accuracy and 60% to 100% coverage of feature interactions in experiments, and scales to a large number of features.},

A typical product line process consists of a domain engineering process and several application engineering processes. We use two different heuristics to characterize artifact redundancies in a product line system: 1) artifacts should not be developed redundantly across domain engineering and application engineering and 2) no two application engineering teams should develop same artifacts redundantly. To provide a formal basis for the heuristics, we derive consistency equations by using mathematical notations of sets. We also use these consistency equations to describe artifact redundancies that occur due to conflicts-of-interests between domain engineering and application engineering. In particular, conflicts-of interests during product line scoping, product instantiation and product line evolution are covered. Furthermore, based on a literature review, we elicit several requirements to address the conflicts-of-interests and artifact redundancies.},

If on the one hand, Web services address the interoperability issues of modern information systems, on the other hand, they enable the development of software systems on the basis of reuse, greatly limiting the necessity for reimplementation. Techniques and methodologies to gain the maximum from this emerging computing paradigm are in great need. In particular, a way to explicitly model and manage variability would greatly facilitate the creation and customization of Web service-based systems. By variability we mean the ability of a software system to be extended, changed, customized or configured for use in a specific context. We present a framework and related tool suite for modeling and managing the variability of Web service-based systems for design and run-time, respectively. It is an extension of the COVAMOF framework for the variability management of software product families, which was developed at the University of Groningen. Among the novelties and advantages of the approach are the full modeling of variability via UML diagrams, the run-time support, and the low involvement of the user. All of which leads to a great deal of automation in the management of all kinds of variability.},

Since each SPL design encodes a set of related products, dealing with multiple designs means that developers must reason about sets of sets of products. The additional degree of multiplicity is not well described by existing product line abstractions. In this paper, we propose an approach for dealing with design uncertainty within SPLs using a novel composition of variability modelling with an abstraction for capturing and managing design uncertainty. This allows developers to accurately describe the decisions involved in making changes to an SPL during the design stage and provides them with a framework for SPL design space exploration by analyzing and enforcing SPL properties.},

abstract = {Feature-oriented programming (FOP) is a programming technique based on composition mechanisms, called refinements. It is often assumed that feature-oriented programming is more suitable than other variability mechanisms for implementing Software Product Lines (SPLs). However, there is no empirical evidence to support this claim. In fact, recent research work found out that some composition mechanisms might degenerate the SPL modularity and stability. However, there is no study investigating these properties focusing on the FOP composition mechanisms. This paper presents quantitative and qualitative analysis of how feature modularity and change propagation behave in the context of two evolving SPLs, namely WebStore and MobileMedia. Quantitative data have been collected from the SPLs developed in three different variability mechanisms: FOP refinements, conditional compilation, and object-oriented design patterns. Our results suggest that FOP requires few changes in source code and a balanced number of added modules, providing better support than other techniques for non-intrusive insertions. Therefore, it adheres closer to the Open-Closed principle. Additionally, FOP seems to be more effective tackling modularity degeneration, by avoiding feature tangling and scattering in source code, than conditional compilation and design patterns. These results are based not only on the variability mechanism itself, but also on careful SPL design. However, the aforementioned results are weaker when the design needs to cope with crosscutting and fine-grained features.},

Whenever software requirements are changed, software architecture should be evolved to correspond with them. Therefore, domain architecture should be designed based on domain requirements. It is essential that there is traceability between requirements and architecture, and that the structure of architecture is derived from quality requirements. The purpose of this paper is to provide a framework for modeling domain architecture based on domain requirements within product lines. In particular, we focus on the traceable relationship between requirements and architectural structures. Our framework consists of processes, methods, and a supporting tool. It uses four basic concepts, namely, goal based domain requirements analysis, Analytical Hierarchy Process, Matrix technique, and architecture styles. Our approach is illustrated using HIS (Home Integration System) product line. Finally, industrial examples are used to validate DRAMA.},

abstract = {A Software Product Line (SPL) is a set of similar software systems that share a common set of features. Instead of building each product from scratch, SPL development takes advantage of the reusability of the core assets shared among the SPL members. In this work, we integrate performance analysis in the early phases of SPL development process, applying the same reusability concept to the performance annotations. Instead of annotating from scratch the UML model of every derived product, we propose to annotate the SPL model once with generic performance annotations. After deriving the model of a product from the family model by an automatic transformation, the generic performance annotations need to be bound to concrete product-specific values provided by the developer. Dealing manually with a large number of performance annotations, by asking the developer to inspect every diagram in the generated model and to extract these annotations is an error-prone process. In this paper we propose to automate the collection of all generic parameters from the product model and to present them to the developer in a user-friendly format (e.g., a spreadsheet per diagram, indicating each generic parameter together with guiding information that helps the user in providing concrete binding values). There are two kinds of generic parametric annotations handled by our approach: product-specific (corresponding to the set of features selected for the product) and platform-specific (such as device choices, network connections, middleware, and runtime environment). The following model transformations for (a) generating a product model with generic annotations from the SPL model, (b) building the spreadsheet with generic parameters and guiding information, and (c) performing the actual binding are all realized in the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL).},

Successful software evolves from a single system by adding and changing functionality to keep up with users' demands and to cater to their similar and different requirements. Nowadays it is a common practice to offer a system in many variants such as community, professional, or academic editions. Each variant provides different functionality described in terms of features. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is an effective software development paradigm for this scenario. At the core of SPLE is variability modelling whose goal is to represent the combinations of features that distinguish the system variants using feature models, the de facto standard for such task. As SPLE practices are becoming more pervasive, reverse engineering feature models from the feature descriptions of each individual variant has become an active research subject. In this paper we evaluated, for this reverse engineering task, three standard search based techniques (evolutionary algorithms, hill climbing, and random search) with two objective functions on 74 SPLs. We compared their performance using precision and recall, and found a clear trade-off between these two metrics which we further reified into a third objective function based on Fβ, an information retrieval measure, that showed a clear performance improvement. We believe that this work sheds light on the great potential of search-based techniques for SPLE tasks.},

In addition, in safety-critical systems the approach has the potential for reuse of analysis and testing results, which can lead to a safer system. Nevertheless, there are times when it seems like a product family approach should work when, in fact, there are difficulties in properly defining the boundaries of the product family. In this paper, we draw on our experiences in applying the software product-line approach to a family of mobile robots, a family of flight guidance systems, and a family of cardiac pacemakers, as well as case studies done by others to (1) illustrate how domain structure can currently limit applicability of product-line approaches to certain domains and (2) demonstrate our progress towards a solution using a set-theoretic approach to reason about domains of what we call n-dimensional and hierarchical product families.},

Customers are often interested not only in particular functionalities (i.e., features), but also in non-functional quality attributes, such as performance, reliability, and footprint. Measuring quality attributes of all products of a product line usually does not scale. In this research-in-progress report, we propose a systematic approach aiming at efficient and scalable prediction of quality attributes of products. To this end, we establish predictors for certain categories of quality attributes (e.g., a predictor for high memory consumption) based on software and network measures, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. We use these predictors to guide a sampling process that takes the assets of a product line as input and determines the products that fall into the category denoted by the given predictor (e.g., products with high memory consumption). We propose to use predictors to make the process of finding "acceptable" products more efficient. We discuss and compare several strategies to incorporate predictors in the sampling process.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) extend the concept of Software Product Lines enabling adaptation at runtime according to context changes. Such dynamic behavior is typically designed using adaptation rules, context-triggered actions responsible for features activation and deactivation at runtime. The erroneous specification and the interleaving of adaptation rules (i.e., the parallel execution of adaptation rules) can lead DSPL to reach an undesired (improperly or defective) product configuration at runtime. Thus, in order to improve the reliability of DSPL behavior, design faults must be rigorously identified and eliminated in the early stages of DSPL development. In this paper, we address this issue introducing Dynamic Feature Transition Systems (DFTSs) that allow the modeling and formal verification of the DSPLs adaptive behavior. These transition systems are derived from the adaptation rules and a Context Kripke Structure, which is a context evolution model. Furthermore, we formally define five properties that can be used to identify existing design faults in DSPL design. Aiming to assess the feasibility of our approach, a feasibility study was conducted using two DSPLs, Mobile Visit Guides and Car. In both cases, design faults were automatically detected indicating that our formalism can help in the detection of design faults in the DSPLs adaptive behavior.},

abstract = {Feature modeling has been widely used in software product line engineering to represent commonality and variabilities among products in a product family. When developing a new software product belonging to a product line, a feature model representing the product line will be used to configure products. The product configuration process is a decision making process, various kinds of constraints and complex relationships among configurable features make the decision making a time consuming and error prone task. In this paper, we present an approach which will improve the efficiency and quality of product configuration.},

abstract = {This work focuses on developing a requirement engineering model (RSPL) based on a Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and Web-tier Application Framework (WAF), to support automatic and interactive requirements generation when creating families of systems. In realizing the model, two goals were targeted namely (i) to construct a RE model that support automatic transformation of domain features into actor-specific requirements; and (ii) to design and implement an interactive web based tool for requirements engineering. The result obtained is twofold: (i) adopting MDA during RE for a product line reduced costs and development time; (ii) tool implementation based on WAF ensured that support for different client types was possible. In conclusion, the study is a contribution to a recently advocated idea that requirements generation could be model-driven. The result shows that the idea is promising with respect to requirement reuse and improving communication barriers among members of a system development team.},

abstract = {Extended feature models enable the expression of complex cross-tree constraints involving feature attributes. The inclusion of attributes in cross-tree relations not only enriches the constraints, but also engenders an extended type of variability that involves attributes. In this article, we elaborate on the effects of this new variability type on feature models. We start by analyzing the nature of the variability involving attributes and extend the definitions of the configuration and the product to suit the emerging requirements. Next, we propose classifications for the features, configurations, and products to identify and formalize the ramifications that arise due to the new type of variability. Then, we provide a semantic foundation grounded on constraint satisfaction for our proposal. We introduce an ordering relation between configurations and show that the set of all the configurations represented by a feature model forms a semilattice. This is followed by a demonstration of how the feature model analyses will be affected using illustrative examples selected from existing and novel analysis operations. Finally, we summarize our experiences, gained from a commercial research and development project that employs an extended feature model.},

abstract = {The integration of multiple SPLs is increasingly becoming a trend to enable on-demand derivation of new products and accelerate their time-to-market. Integration of SPLs often implies the reuse of a previously-implemented feature across other SPLs. The reuse of a SPL feature is only viable if the underlying programming mechanisms enable its smooth composition within the code of other SPLs. If the required modifications are significant, the design of the target SPLs are likely to be destabilized. This paper presents an exploratory study on the integration of three product lines from the board game domain. We investigate how aspect-oriented and feature-oriented programming impact on the reuse and stability of those product lines.},

In a component-based approach to product line development, components capture functionalities appearing in one or more products in the family and different assemblies of components yield to various products or configurations. In this approach, an interaction model which effectively factors out the logic handling variability from the functionality of the system greatly enhances the reusability of components. We study the problem of variability modeling for a family of distributed systems expressed in actor model. We define a special type of actors called coordinators whose behavior is described as Reo circuits with the aim of encapsulating the variability logic. We have the benefits of Reo language for expressing coordination logic, while modeling the entire system as an actor-based distributed model. We have applied this model to a case study extracted from an industrial software family in the domain of interactive TV.},

However, the usage of existing search operators changes the PLA organization, and consequently may violate layered rules, impacting negatively in the architecture understanding. In order to solve this problem, this work introduces search operators that consider the layered architectural style rules. Results show that the proposed operators contribute to obtain better solutions, maintaining the adopted style, with better or equivalent fitness values.},

abstract = {Software product lines enable the reuse of shared software across a family of products. As new products are built in the product line, new features are added. A feature is a unit of functionality. Unwanted feature interactions, wherein one feature hinders another feature’s operation, are a significant problem, especially as large software product lines evolve. Detecting feature interactions is a time-consuming and difficult task for developers. Moreover, feature interactions are often only discovered during testing, at which point costly re-work is needed. The work described here investigates how to discover feature interactions much earlier in the development process. Toward this goal, we propose a similarity-based approach that mines prior feature interactions stored in the software product line’s artifacts to predict unwanted interactions between a new feature and existing features. Initial results show that the planned methodology performs well in terms of accuracy and coverage both in experiments on three small software product lines in the literature and in experiments on one large, real-world software product line.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) encompass systems that are capable of modifying their own behavior with respect to changes in their operating environment by using run-time reconfigurations. A failure in these reconfigurations can directly impact the user experience since the reconfigurations are performed when the system is already under the users control. In this work, we prototype a Smart Hotel DSPL to evaluate the reliability-based risk of the DSPL reconfigurations, specifically, the probability of malfunctioning (Availability) and the consequences of malfunctioning (Severity). This DSPL prototype was performed with the participation of human subjects by means of a Smart Hotel case study which was deployed with real devices. Moreover, we successfully identified and addressed two challenges associated with the involvement of human subjects in DSPL prototyping: enabling participants to (1) trigger the run-time reconfigurations and to (2) understand the effects of the reconfigurations. The evaluation of the case study reveals positive results regarding both Availability and Severity. However, the participant feedback highlights issues with recovering from a failed reconfiguration or a reconfiguration triggered by mistake. To address these issues, we discuss some guidelines learned in the case study. Finally, although the results achieved by the DSPL may be considered satisfactory for its particular domain, DSPL engineers must provide users with more control over the reconfigurations or the users will not be comfortable with DSPLs.},

The ABS language has a hybrid functional and object- oriented core, and comes with extensions that support the development of systems that are adaptable to diversified requirements, yet capable to maintain a high level of trustworthiness. Using ABS, system variability is consistently traceable from the level of requirements engineering down to object behaviour. This facilitates temporal evolution, as changes to the required set of features of a system are automatically reflected by functional adaptation of the system's behaviour. The analysis capabilities of ABS stretch from debugging, observing and simulating to resource analysis of ABS models and help ensure that a system will remain dependable throughout its evolutionary lifetime. We report on the experience of using the ABS language and the ABS tool suite in an industrial case study.},

Especially, it provides several tools for supporting architecture-model-based software development where: (1) product line architectures can be specified using various architecture patterns, (2) application-specific architectures can be derived from the product line architecture specifications, (3) application-specific control components can be generated from the application architecture specifications, and (4) different deployment architectures can be configured with various component communication mechanisms.

abstract = {The architectural decision-making process is a complex and crucial endeavor in companies that develop large and distributed software systems. In this process, choosing and evaluating a solution for each architectural issue depends on decision drivers. The drivers are mainly the business factors (e.g., cost, time-to-market, etc.) and software quality attributes (e.g., security, adaptability, etc.). This paper examines whether there is agreement among experts in associating (i.e., relating) architectural issues with relevant quality attributes. We conducted a survey with 37 experts from several industrial domains who, at least once a month, make one or more architectural decisions. The results show there is poor agreement among these experts in identifying and scoring relevant quality attributes for each architectural issue. Poor agreement implies that the associating task is subjective, and that experts inconsistently define and interpret the relevance of various quality attributes for a given architectural issue that may hurt the sustainability of their architectural decisions. This paper suggests that practitioners in their decision-making should employ approaches that are more systematic. The approaches should be supported by methods and tools designed to diminish the biases of intuitive, experience-based approaches of associating architectural issues with quality attributes.},

As FM construction can be tedious and time-consuming, researchers have previously developed techniques for extracting FMs from sets of formally specified individual configurations, or from software requirements specifications for families of existing products. However, such artifacts are often not available. In this paper we present a novel, automated approach for constructing FMs from publicly available product descriptions found in online product repositories and marketing websites such as SoftPedia and CNET. While each individual product description provides only a partial view of features in the domain, a large set of descriptions can provide fairly comprehensive coverage. Our approach utilizes hundreds of partial product descriptions to construct an FM and is described and evaluated against antivirus product descriptions mined from SoftPedia.},

Testing SPLs is an intensive process where choosing the proper products to include in the testing process can be a critical task. In fact, selecting the best combination of features from an SPL is a complex problem that is frequently addressed in the literature. In this paper we use evolutionary algorithms to find a combination of features with low testing cost that include a target feature, to facilitate the integration testing of such feature. Specifically, we use an Ant Colony Optimisation algorithm to find one of the cheapest (in terms of testing) combination of features that contains a specific feature. Our results show that our framework overcomes the limitations of both brute force and random search algorithms.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is a promising paradigm for developing software intensive systems. Among their proven benefits are reduced time to market, better asset reuse and improved software quality. To achieve this, the collection of products of the product line are specified by means of product line models. Feature Models (FMs) are a common notation to represent product lines that express the set of feature combinations that software products can have. Experience shows that these models can have defects. Defects in FMs be inherited to the products configured from these models. Consequently, defects must be early identified and corrected. Several works reported in scientific literature, deal with identification of defects in FMs. However, only few of these proposals are able to explain how to fix defects, and only some corrections are suggested. This paper proposes a new method to detect all possible corrections from a defective product line model. The originality of the contribution is that corrections can be found when the method systematically eliminates dependencies from the FMs. The proposed method was applied on 78 distinct FMs with sizes up to 120 dependencies. Evaluation indicates that the method proposed in this paper scale up, is accurate, and sometimes useful in real scenarios.},

In order to address these challenges within the context of SMEs, we adopt and extend the behavior-driven development methodology in a way to not only offer agility in practice but also to equip software developers with the means to capture and manage software variability within the behavior-driven development process.

abstract = {In the light of computational outsourcing and external data storage, data protection and trusted execution become increasingly important. Novel hardware such as Intel's Software Guard extensions (SGX) attempts to provide a solution to protect data and computations from unauthorized access and manipulation, even against attackers with physical access to a machine. However, the current generation of SGX limits the protected memory space that can be efficiently used to 128 MiB, which must be shared between data and binary code. Thus, we propose to use a software product line approach to tailor an application's binary code in such a way that it can be updated during runtime, with the goal to only store relevant features in the protected memory at a given time. We provide a prototypical implementation that enables basic support for loading and unloading features during runtime and evaluate our prototype in terms of execution times against non-adaptive execution.},

While a number of architecture assessment methods are available and some of them have been widely used in the process of evaluating single product architectures, none of them is equipped to deal with the main challenges of product line development. In this paper we present an adaptation of the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) for the task of assessing product line architectures. The new method, labeled Holistic Product Line Architecture Assessment (HoPLAA), uses a holistic approach that focuses on risks and quality attribute tradeoffs - not only for the common product line architecture, but for the individual product architectures as well. In addition, it prescribes a qualitative analytical treatment of variation points using scenarios. The use of the new method is illustrated through a case study.},

Quality variability, less understood and more complex, has not received so much attention by researchers. However, different members of the line may require different levels of a quality attribute. The design phase is a good point to assure that quality attributes requirements are met within the product line so this means paying attention to software architecture evaluation during Domain Engineering. The quality evaluation in software product lines is much more complicated than in single-systems as products can require different quality levels and the product line can have variability on design that in turn affects quality. The evaluation of all the products of a line is very expensive. Thus, ways of reducing the evaluation efforts are necessary. Herein is presented a method for facilitating cost-effective quality evaluation of a product line taking into consideration variability on quality attributes.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering concerns itself with domain engineering and application engineering. During domain engineering, the whole product family is modeled with a preferred flavor of feature models and additional models as required (e.g., domain models or scenario-based models). During application engineering, the focus shifts toward a single family member and the configuration of the member's features. Recently, aspectual concepts have been employed to better encapsulate individual features of a Software Product Line (SPL), but the existing body of SPL work does not include a unified reasoning framework that integrates aspect-oriented feature description artifacts with the capability to reason about stakeholders' goals while taking feature interactions into consideration. Goal-oriented SPL approaches have been proposed, but do not provide analysis capabilities that help modelers meet the needs of the numerous stakeholders involved in an SPL while at the same time considering feature interactions. We present an aspect-oriented SPL approach for the requirements phase that allows modelers (a) to capture features, goals, and scenarios in a unified framework and (b) to reason about stakeholders' needs and perform trade-off analyses while considering undesirable interactions that are not obvious from the feature model. The approach is based on the Aspect-oriented User Requirements Notation (AoURN) and helps identify, prioritize, and choose products based on analysis results provided by AoURN editor and analysis tools. We apply the AoURN-based SPL framework to the Via Verde SPL to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach through the selection of a Via Verde product configuration that satisfies stakeholders' needs and results in a high-level, scenario-based specification that is free from undesirable feature interactions.},

abstract = {Users of bioinformatics software tools range from bench scientists with little computational experience, to sophisticated developers.  As the number and types of tools available to this diverse set of users grow, they are also increasing in flexibility. The customization of these tools makes them highly-configurable — where the end user is provided with many customization (configuration) options.  At the same time, biologists and chemists are engineering living organisms by programming their DNA in a process that mimics software development.  As they share their designs and promote re-use, their programs are also emerging as highly-configurable.  As these bioscience systems become mainstream tools for the biology and bioinformatics communities, their dependability, reliability, and reproducibility becomes critical. Scientists are making decisions and drawing conclusions based on the software they use, and the constructs designed by synthetic biologists are being built into living organisms and used in the real world.  Yet there is little help guiding users of bioinformatics tools or those building new synthetic organisms.  As an end user equipped with minimal information, it is hard to predict the effect of changing a particular configuration option, yet the choice of configuration can lead to a large amount of variation in functionality and performance.  Even if the configuration options make sense to an expert user, understanding all options and their interactions is difficult or even impossible to compute due to the exponential number of combinations.  Similarly, synthetic biologists must choose how to combine small DNA segments.  However, there can be millions of ways to combine these pieces, and determining the architecture can require significant domain knowledge.In this dissertation we address these challenges of interpreting the effects of configurability in two areas in the biosciences: (1) bioinformatics software, and (2) synthetic biology.  We highlight the challenges of configurability in these areas and provide approaches to help users navigate their configuration spaces leading to more interpretable configurable software in the biosciences.First, we demonstrate there is variability in both the functional and performance outcomes of highly-configurable bioinformatics tools, and find previously undetected faults.  We discuss the implications of this variability, and provide suggestions for developers.  Second, we develop a user-oriented framework to identify the effect of changing configuration options in software, and communicate these effects to the end user in a simplistic format.  We demonstrate our framework in a large study and compare to a state of the art method for performance-influence modeling in software.Last, we define a mapping of software product line engineering to the domain of synthetic biology resulting in organic software product lines.  We demonstrate the potential reuse and existence of both commonality and variability in an open source synthetic biology repository.   We build feature models for four commonly engineered biological functions and demonstrate how product line engineering can benefit synthetic biologists.},

abstract = {Big data is revolutionizing how all sectors of our economy do business, including telecommunication, transportation, medical, and finance. Big data comes in two flavors: data at rest and data in motion. Processing data in motion is stream processing. Stream processing for big data analytics often requires scale that can only be delivered by a distributed system, exploiting parallelism on many hosts and many cores. One such distributed stream processing system is IBM Streams. Early customer experience with IBM Streams uncovered that another core requirement is extensibility, since customers want to build high-performance domain-specific operators for use in their streaming applications. Based on these two core requirements of distribution and extensibility, we designed and implemented the Streams Processing Language (SPL). This article describes SPL with an emphasis on the language design, distributed runtime, and extensibility mechanism. SPL is now the gateway for the IBM Streams platform, used by our customers for stream processing in a broad range of application domains.},

abstract = {A domain model, which captures the common knowledge and the possible variability allowed among applications in a domain, may assist in the creation of other valid applications in that domain. However, to create such domain models is not a trivial task: it requires expertise in the domain, reaching a very high level of abstraction, and providing flexible, yet formal, artifacts. In this paper an approach, called Semi-automated Domain Modeling (SDM), to create draft domain models from applications in those domains, is presented. SDM takes a repository of application models in a domain and matches, merges, and generalizes them into sound draft domain models that include the commonality and variability allowed in these domains. The similarity of the different elements is measured, with consideration of syntactic, semantic, and structural aspects. Unlike ontology and schema integration, these models capture both structural and behavioral aspects of the domain. Running SDM on small repositories of project management applications and scheduling systems, we found that the approach may provide reasonable draft domain models, whose comprehensibility, correctness, completeness, and consistency levels are satisfactory.},

abstract = {Variability management has become an important concern in software and systems engineering. Especially in industrial settings a rigid management of variability has been identified as an important prerequisite for further optimization of the development process, e.g. for reuse of software sub-systems across vehicle models such as the Mercedes Benz A-Class and C-Class. In response to this growing practical interest, the scientific community has come up with numerous concepts and techniques for modeling variability. However, despite initial attempts to integrate or unify some of these manifold approaches, a clear understanding of how they precisely relate to each other is still not yet achieved.In the paper, various techniques for variability modeling are elaborated and a basic classification scheme is proposed. From this we derive their common capabilities, which arguably embody the essence of variability modeling in general. On this basis, a discussion is presented that concerns the potential and feasibility of integrating all these diverse techniques into a single, common technique for variability modeling.},

abstract = {Migrating a family of software systems from ad-hoc development approaches such as `clone-and-own' towards software product lines (SPL) is a challenging task. Software architecture recovery techniques can play a crucial role in such a migration. However, it is to date still unclear how these techniques, which have been mostly developed for single system architecture recovery in mind, can be utilized in an SPL context most effectively. In this paper, we present a mapping study examining 35 research articles with the purpose of discussing the current state of the art in applying software architecture recovery techniques for SPL and identifying potential research gaps in this area. The results provide evidence that currently used approaches do not seem to consider the potential architectural degradation that might exist in the family of systems to be migrated. Moreover, it is hard to generalize across empirical studies as currently it seems difficult to compare and benchmark the approaches applied for software product line architecture (SPLA) extraction/reconstruction.},

abstract = {Support to the quality attribute (QA) &amp; metric selection process.Maintainability is the most studied QA for most domains and development phases.Quality attributes are usually assessed through a correlation to a single metric.Metrics are validated in empirical settings and may lack theoretical validity. Developing a plan for monitoring software quality is a non-trivial task, in the sense that it requires: (a) the selection of relevant quality attributes, based on application domain and development phase, and (b) the selection of appropriate metrics to quantify quality attributes. The metrics selection process is further complicated due to the availability of various metrics for each quality attribute, and the constraints that impact metric selection (e.g., development phase, metric validity, and available tools). In this paper, we shed light on the state-of-research of design-time quality attributes by conducting a mapping study. We have identified 154 papers that have been included as primary studies. The study led to the following outcomes: (a) low-level quality attributes (e.g., cohesion, coupling, etc.) are more frequently studied than high-level ones (e.g., maintainability, reusability, etc.), (b) maintainability is the most frequently examined high-level quality attribute, regardless of the application domain or the development phase, (c) assessment of quality attributes is usually performed by a single metric, rather than a combination of multiple metrics, and (d) metrics are mostly validated in an empirical setting. These outcomes are interpreted and discussed based on related work, offering useful implications to both researchers and practitioners.},

abstract = {Organizations can reduce the costs and enhance the quality of required software by adapting existing software systems. Software adaptation decisions often involve comparing alternatives on two criteria: (1) how well a system meets users' requirements and (2) the effort required for adapting the system. These criteria reflect two points of view - of users and of developers. Common to both views is the notion of functionality, which software developers have traditionally used for effort estimation utilizing concepts such as function points. However, users involved in selecting systems are not necessarily familiar with such concepts. We propose an approach for comparing software functionality from users' point of view. The approach employs ontological concepts to define functionality in terms of system behaviors. To evaluate whether or not the approach is also usable by software developers, we conducted an exploratory experiment. In the experiment, software engineering students ranked descriptions of software systems on the amount of changes needed to adapt the systems to given requirements. The results demonstrated that the ontological approach was usable after a short training and provided results comparable to ranking done by expert software developers. We also compared the ontological approach to a method which employed function point concepts. The results showed no statistically significant differences in performance, but there seemed to be an advantage to the ontological approach for cases that were difficult to analyze. Moreover, it took less time to apply the ontological approach than the function point-based approach, and the difference was statistically significant.},

abstract = {Mobile Applications are rapidly emerging as a convenient medium for using a variety of services. Over time and with the high penetration of smartphones in society, self-adaptation has become an essential capability required by mobile application users. In an ideal scenario, an application is required to adjust its behavior according to the current context of its use. This raises the challenge in mobile computing towards the design and development of applications that sense and react to contextual changes to provide a value-added user experience. In its general sense, context information can relate to the environment, the user, or the device status. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for building context aware and adaptive mobile applications. Based on feature modeling and Software Product Lines (SPL) concepts, this framework guides the modeling of adaptability at design time and supports context awareness and adaptability at runtime. In the core of the approach, is a feature meta-model that incorporates, in addition to SPL concepts, application feature priorities to drive the adaptability. A tool, based on that feature model, is presented to model the mobile application features and to derive the SPL members. A mobile framework, built on top of OSGI framework to dynamically adapt the application at runtime is also described.},

abstract = {The evolution of the population pyramid in developed countries, with an increasing proportion of aged people introduces new challenges to the public and private assistance services. A form of improving these services while keeping controlled the associated costs is to use remote continuous assistance. Wireless sensors allow obtaining real-time information of health parameters in a non-intrusive way. The determination of alert values for these parameters and the computing possibilities of the current mobile devices can facilitate a faster intervention which will minimize risks linked to delays in medical assistance. However, the diversity of risk situations is a factor that increases costs as many similar but not exactly identical products will be necessary now and in the future. We aim to solve this problem using an approach of software product lines, as multiple options can be easily incorporated to each final product implementation. This article presents the product line generic architecture and some examples of application, using wireless sensors connected to a central station by means of a smart phone, which is able to detect alarm situations.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering allows large software systems to be developed and adapted for varying customer needs. The products of a software product line can be described by means of a &lt;em&gt;hierarchical variability model&lt;/em&gt; specifying the commonalities and variabilities between the artifacts of the individual products. The number of products generated by a hierarchical model is exponential in its size, which poses a serious challenge to software product line analysis and verification. For an analysis technique to scale, the effort has to be linear in the size of the model rather than linear in the number of products it generates. Hence, efficient product line verification is only possible if &lt;em&gt;compositional&lt;/em&gt; verification techniques are applied that allow the analysis of products to be &lt;em&gt;relativized&lt;/em&gt; on the properties of their variation points. In this paper, we propose simple hierarchical variability models (SHVM) with explicit variation points as a novel way to describe a set of products consisting of sets of methods. SHVMs provide a trade---off between expressiveness and a clean and simple model suitable for compositional verification. We generalize a previously developed compositional technique and tool set for the automatic verification of control---flow based temporal safety properties to product lines defined by SHVMs, and prove soundness of the generalization. The desired property relativization is achieved by introducing variation point specifications. We evaluate the proposed technique on a number of test cases.},

Since their introduction, feature models have been extended and formalised in various ways. The majority of these extensions are variants of the original tree-based graphical notation. But over time, textual dialects have also been proposed. The textual variability language (TVL) was proposed to combine the advantages of both graphical and textual notations. However, its benefits and limitations have not been empirically evaluated up to now. In this paper, we evaluate TVL with four cases from companies of different sizes and application domains. The study shows that practitioners can benefit from TVL. The participants appreciated the notation, the advantages of a textual language and considered the learning curve to be gentle. The study also reveals some limitations of the current version of TVL.},

abstract = {Creating a valid software configuration often involves multiple configuration file types, such as feature models, domain-specific languages, or C header files with preprocessor defines. Enforcing constraints across file types boundaries already at configuration is necessary to prevent inconsistencies, which otherwise are costly to discover and resolve later on. We present a pragmatic framework to specify and apply inconsistency-resolving fixes on configuration files of arbitrary types. The framework converts each configuration file to a model, checks it for consistency, applies fixes, and serializes it back again. We argue that conventionally programmed fixes and round-trip mechanisms (i.e., converters and serializers) are indispensable for practical applicability and can provide sufficient reliability when following usual development practices. We have developed round-trip mechanisms for seven different configuration file types and two fixing mechanisms. One fixing mechanism extends previous work by combining automatic detection of correct fix locations with a marker mechanism that reduces the number of locations. A tool-supported process for applying the fixes provides user guidance and integrates additional semantic validity checks on serialized configuration files of complex types (e.g., feature models). Evaluations reveal a speed up in inconsistency fixing and that the performance of the currently integrated round-tripping and fixing mechanisms is competitive.},

abstract = {Software-product-line engineering aims at the development of variable and reusable software systems. In practice, software product lines are often implemented with preprocessors. Preprocessor directives are easy to use, and many mature tools are available for practitioners. However, preprocessor directives have been heavily criticized in academia and even referred to as "#ifdef hell", because they introduce threats to program comprehension and correctness. There are many voices that suggest to use other implementation techniques instead, but these voices ignore the fact that a transition from preprocessors to other languages and tools is tedious, erroneous, and expensive in practice. Instead, we and others propose to increase the readability of preprocessor directives by using background colors to highlight source code annotated with ifdef directives. In three controlled experiments with over 70 subjects in total, we evaluate whether and how background colors improve program comprehension in preprocessor-based implementations. Our results demonstrate that background colors have the potential to improve program comprehension, independently of size and programming language of the underlying product. Additionally, we found that subjects generally favor background colors. We integrate these and other findings in a tool called FeatureCommander, which facilitates program comprehension in practice and which can serve as a basis for further research.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineering has proven to improve software quality and shorten development cycles, cost and time. In product line engineering, product derivation is concerned with the realization of the variability at the implementation level. However, the majority of research works focuses on instantiating the variants selected in the final product, while the derivation at the architecture level has been poorly explored. As product line engineers often customize the product architecture by hand during the application engineering phase, the derivation and customization processes of the product line architecture (PLA) might be in some cases error-prone. Consequently, in this research we present an Ontology-based product Architecture Derivation (OntoAD) framework which automates the derivation of product-specific architectures from an SPL architecture. Our solution uses a language-independent model to specify the product line architecture and a model-driven engineering approach for architecture derivation activities. We use an ontology formalism to reason about the automatic generation of model-to-model transformation rules based on the selection of features and we illustrate our approach using a voice over IP motivating example. Finally, we report results about scalability and performance regarding the size of the variability model.},

abstract = {Although significant progress achieved, multi-label classification is still challenging due to the complexity of correlations among different labels. Furthermore, modeling the relationships between input and some (dull) classes further increases the difficulty of accurately predicting all possible labels. In this work, we propose to select a small subset of labels as landmarks which are easy to predict according to input (predictable) and can well recover the other possible labels (representative). Different from existing methods which separate the landmark selection and landmark prediction in the 2-step manner, the proposed algorithm, termed Selecting Predictable Landmarks for Multi-Label Learning (SPL-MLL), jointly conducts landmark selection, landmark prediction, and label recovery in a unified framework, to ensure both the representativeness and predictableness for selected landmarks. We employ the Alternating Direction Method (ADM) to solve our problem. Empirical studies on real-world datasets show that our method achieves superior classification performance over other state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Process modeling is an expensive task that needs to encompass requirements of different stakeholders, assure compliance with different standards, and enable the flexible adaptivity to newly emerging requirements in today's dynamic global market. Identifying reusability of process models is a promising direction towards reducing the costs of process modeling. Recent research has offered several solutions. Such solutions promote effective and formally sound methods for variability modeling and configuration management. However, ensuring behavioral validity of reused process models with respect to the original process models (often referred to as reference process models) is still an open research challenge. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose the notion of business process families by building upon the well-known software engineering discipline-software product line engineering. Business process families comprise (i) a variability modeling perspective, (ii) a process model template (or reference model), and (iii) mappings between (i) and (ii). For business process families, we propose a correct validation algorithm ensuring that each member of a business process family adheres to the core intended behavior that is specified in the process model template. The proposed validation approach is based on the use of Description Logics, variability is represented by using the well-known Feature Models and behavior of process models is considered in terms of control flow patterns. The paper also reports on the experience gained in two external trial cases and results obtained by measuring the tractability of the implementation of the proposed validation approach.},

abstract = {Variability modeling is a major part of modern product line engineering. Graphical or table-based approaches to variability modeling are focused around abstract models and specialized tools to interact with these models. However, more recently textual variability modeling languages, comparable to some extent to programming languages, were introduced. We consider the recent trend in product line engineering towards textual variability modeling languages as a phenomenon, which deserves deeper analysis. In this article, we report on the results and approach of a literature survey combined with an expert study. In the literature survey, we identified 11 languages, which enable the textual specification of product line variability and which are sufficiently described for an in-depth analysis. We provide a classification scheme, useful to describe the range of capabilities of such languages. Initially, we identified the relevant capabilities of these languages from a literature survey. The result of this has been refined, validated and partially improved by the expert survey. A second recent phenomenon in product line variability modeling is the increasing scale of variability models. Some authors of textual variability modeling languages argue that these languages are more appropriate for large-scale models. As a consequence, we would expect specific capabilities addressing scalability in the languages. Thus, we compare the capabilities of textual variability modeling techniques, if compared to graphical variability modeling approaches and in particular to analyze their specialized capabilities for large-scale models.},

abstract = {Adoption of Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) to support systematic reuse of software-related artifacts within product families is challenging, time-consuming and error-prone. Analyzing the variability of existing artifacts needs to reflect different perspectives and preferences of stakeholders in order to facilitate decisions in SPLE adoption. Considering that requirements drive many development methods and activities, we introduce an approach to analyze variability of behaviors as presented in functional requirements. The approach, called semantic and ontological variability analysis (SOVA), uses ontological and semantic considerations to automatically analyze differences between initial states (preconditions), external events (triggers) that act on the system, and final states (post-conditions) of behaviors. The approach generates feature diagrams typically used in SPLE to model variability. Those diagrams are organized according to perspective profiles, reflecting the needs and preferences of the potential stakeholders for given tasks. We conducted an empirical study to examine the usefulness of the approach by comparing it to an existing tool which is mainly based on a latent semantic analysis measurement. SOVA appears to create outputs that are more comprehensible in significantly shorter times. These results demonstrate SOVA's potential to allow for flexible, behavior-oriented variability analysis.},

ResultsThe study provides a better understanding of SPL adoption in the context of small to medium-sized organizations, by documenting evidence observed during the transition from single-system development to an SPL approach. This evidence is strengthened by the use of different research methods, which results in 22 findings regarding to the SPL adoption. ConclusionThis research has synthesized the available evidence in SPL adoption and identifies gaps between required strategies, organizational structures, maturity level and existing adoption barriers.

abstract = {Multi-tenancy, where multiple end users make use of the same application instance, is often used in clouds to reduce hosting costs. A disadvantage of multi-tenancy is however that it makes it difficult to create customizable applications, as all end users use the same application instance. In this article, we describe an approach for the development and management of highly customizable multi-tenant cloud applications. We apply software product line engineering techniques to cloud applications, and use an approach where applications are composed of multiple interacting components, referred to as application features. Using this approach, multiple features can be shared between different applications. Allocating resources for these feature-based applications is complex, as relations between components must be taken into account, and is referred to as the feature placement problem.In this article, we describe dynamic feature placement algorithms that minimize migrations between subsequent invocations, and evaluate them in dynamic scenarios where applications are added and removed throughout the evaluation scenario. We find that the developed algorithm achieves a low cost, while resulting in few resource migrations. In our evaluations, we observe that adding migration-awareness to the management algorithms reduces the number of instance migrations by more than 77 % and reduces the load moved between instances by more than 96 % when compared to a static management approach. Despite this reduction in number of migrations, a cost that is on average less than 3 % more than the optimal cost is achieved. We model customizable SaaS applications using feature modeling.A dynamic, migration-aware management approach is presented.Two ILP-based algorithms and a heuristic algorithm are compared.The dynamic algorithms reduce migrations and remain within 3% of the optimal cost.},

abstract = {Many modern software-intensive systems consist of multiple components interacting together to deliver the intended functionality. Often, these systems come in many variants (products) and are managed together as a software product line. This variability is the source of additional complexity which can cause inconsistencies and offset the economies of scale promised by product line engineering. Engineers thus need intuitive, yet precise means for specifying requirements and require tools for automatically detecting inconsistencies within these requirements. In recent work, we proposed a technique for the scenario-based specification of interactions in product lines by a combination of Modal Sequence Diagrams and Feature Diagrams. Furthermore, we elaborated an efficient consistency-checking technique based on a dedicated model-checking approach especially tailored for product lines. In this paper, we report on further evaluations that underline significant performance benefits of our approach. We describe further optimizations and detail on how we encode the consistency-checking problem for a model-checker.},

abstract = {The paper proposes to integrate performance analysis in the early phases of the model-driven development process for Software Product Lines (SPL). We start by adding generic performance annotations to the UML model representing the set of core reusable SPL assets. The annotations are generic and use the MARTE Profile recently adopted by OMG. A first model transformation realized in the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL), which is the focus of this paper, derives the UML model of a specific product with concrete MARTE performance annotations from the SPL model. A second transformation generates a Layered Queueing Network performance model for the given product by applying an existing transformation approach named PUMA, developed in previous work. The proposed technique is illustrated with an e-commerce case study that models the commonality and variability in both structural and behavioural SPL views. A product is derived and the performance of two design alternatives is compared.},

abstract = {Domain analysis is crucial and central to software product line engineering (SPLE) as it is one of the main instruments to decide what to include in a product and how it should fit in to the overall software product line. For this reason many domain analysis solutions have been proposed both by researchers and industry practitioners. Domain analysis comprises various modeling and scoping activities. This paper presents a systematic review of all the domain analysis solutions presented until 2007. The goal of the review is to analyze the level of industrial application and/or empirical validation of the proposed solutions with the purpose of mapping maturity in terms of industrial application, as well as to what extent proposed solutions might have been evaluated in terms of usability and usefulness. The finding of this review indicates that, although many new domain analysis solutions for software product lines have been proposed over the years, the absence of qualitative and quantitative results from empirical application and/or validation makes it hard to evaluate the potential of proposed solutions with respect to their usability and/or usefulness for industry adoption. The detailed results of the systematic review can be used by individual researchers to see large gaps in research that give opportunities for future work, and from a general research perspective lessons can be learned from the absence of validation as well as from good examples presented. From an industry practitioner view, the results can be used to gauge as to what extent solutions have been applied and/or validated and in what manner, both valuable as input prior to industry adoption of a domain analysis solution.},

We see two challenges against deriving and intended products with respect to the specification of feature realizations:1 The developer is not provided with immediate feedback on the realization steps at design time.2 How to ensure that the realization steps are consistent with high-level features.The Common Variability Language (CVL) is a generic language for modeling variability and the CVL tool can be used for product line development. We propose two extensions to the CVL tool to address the aforementioned challenges:1 A simulator that simulates the feature realizations and visualizes the resulting product model at design time.2 A consistency checker that checks if the realizations are consistent with high-level features.We illustrate these two added procedures by applying them to the development of a train control product line.

abstract = {Web services run in complex contexts where arising events may compromise the quality of the whole system. Thus, it is desirable to count on autonomic mechanisms to guide the self-adaptation of service compositions according to changes in the computing infrastructure. One way to achieve this goal is by implementing variability constructs at the language level. However, this approach may become tedious, difficult to manage, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a solution based on a semantically rich variability model to support the dynamic adaptation of service compositions. When a problematic event arises in the context, this model is leveraged for decision-making. The activation and deactivation of features in the variability model result in changes in a composition model that abstracts the underlying service composition. These changes are reflected into the service composition by adding or removing fragments of Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) code, which can be deployed at runtime. In order to reach optimum adaptations, the variability model and its possible configurations are verified at design time using Constraint Programming. An evaluation demonstrates several benefits of our approach, both at design time and at runtime.},

abstract = {More and more companies are offering their software by following the Software as a Service (SaaS) model. The promise of the SaaS model is to exploit economies of scale on the provider side by hosting multiple customers (or tenants) on the same hardware and software infrastructure. However, to attract a significant number of tenants, SaaS applications have to be customizable to fulfill the varying functional and quality requirements of individual tenants. In this paper, we describe how variability modeling techniques from software product line engineering can support SaaS providers in managing the variability of SaaS applications and their requirements. Specifically, we propose using explicit variability models to systematically derive customization and deployment information for individual SaaS tenants. We also demonstrate how variability models could be used to systematically consider information about already deployed SaaS applications for efficiently deploying SaaS applications for new tenants. We illustrate our approach by a running example for a meeting planning application.},

A dynamic software product line (DSPL) can benefit from knowing how its various product variants would have performed (in terms of quality of service) with respect to the recent history of inputs. We propose a family-based analysis that simulates all the product variants of a DSPL simultaneously, at runtime, on recent environmental inputs to obtain an estimate of the quality of service that each one of the product variants would have had, provided it had been executing. We assessed the efficiency of our DSPL analysis compared to the efficiency of analyzing each product individually on three case studies. We obtained mixed results due to the explosion of quality-of-service values for the product variants of a DSPL. After introducing a simple data abstraction on the values of quality-of- service variables, our DSPL analysis is between 1.4 and 7.7 times faster than analyzing the products one at a time.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a convergence between research in SPL and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) that leverages the complementary capabilities that both paradigms can offer. A crucial factor for the success of MDE is the availability of effective support for detecting and fixing inconsistencies among model elements. The importance of such support is attested by the extensive literature devoted to the topic. However, when coupled with variability, the research focus has been devoted to inconsistency detection, while leaving the important issue of fixing the inconsistency largely unaddressed. In this research-in-progress paper, we explore one of the issues that variability raises for inconsistency fixing. Namely, in which features to locate the fixes. We compute what is the minimal number of fixes and use it as a baseline to compare fixes obtained with a heuristic based on feature model analysis and random approaches. Our work highlights the pros and cons of both approaches and suggests how they could be addressed.},

The configuration process selects features from the feature model according to the stakeholders' requirements. Selecting the right set of features for one product from all the available features in the feature model is a cumbersome task because 1) the stakeholders may have diverse business concerns and limited resources that they can spend on a product and 2) features may have negative and positive contributions on different business concern. Many configurations techniques have been proposed to facilitate software developers' tasks through automated product derivation. However, most of the current proposals for automatic configuration are not devised to cope with business oriented requirements and stakeholders' resource limitations. We propose a framework, which employs an artificial intelligence planning technique to automatically select suitable features that satisfy the stakeholders' business concerns and resource limitations. We also provide tooling support to facilitate the use of our framework.},

Objective: In this paper, we aim at contributing to the development of a basic understanding of the notion of variability in the software architecture domain, beyond the idea of product lines. Method: We perform a preliminary exploratory study which consists of two parts: an expert survey among 11 subjects, and a mini focus group with 4 participants. For both parts, we collect and analyze mostly qualitative data. Results: Our observations indicate that there seems to be no common understanding of "variability" in the context of software architecture. On the other hand, some challenges related to variability in software architecture are similar to challenges identified in the product line domain. Conclusions: Variability in software architecture might require more theoretical foundations in order to establish "variability" as an architectural key concept and first-class quality attribute.},

Records of the usage behaviour of mobile users can provide valuable information for understanding the behaviour of networks for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). For different reasons, MNOs are interested in knowing how their competitors’ performance varies based on location, phone category, phone Operating System (OS) for various cellular network technology (CNT). This can help MNOs to invest intelligently in locations where they operate with inferior performance. Therefore, Key Performance Indicator (KPI) comparisons among MNOs are of interest for all MNOs. In this article, we investigate cellular network performance statistical comparisons of major Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) in Turkey using a large scale real-world proprietary mobile traffic dataset over a period of 18 months. Focusing our approach on different dimensions of crowd-sourced dataset allows us: (i) to know end-to-end nationwide network performance comparisons of MNOs using real-world measurement data, (ii) to calculate Confidence Intervals (CIs) for the mean difference of KPIs (such as downlink speed, latency, jitter and packet loss) for obtaining useful comparative statistical information of MNO performances and (iii) to observe the existence of significant performance differences between MNOs depending on the region which they are operating, phone category, phone OS as well as CNTs.},

abstract = {Feature models are a widely used modeling notation for variability and commonality management in software product line (SPL) engineering. In order to keep an SPL and its feature model aligned, feature models must be changed by including/excluding new features and products, either because faults in the model are found or to reflect the normal evolution of the SPL. The modification of the feature model able to satisfy these change requirements can be complex and error-prone. In this paper, we present a method that is able to automatically update a feature model in order to satisfy a given update request. Our method is based on an evolutionary algorithm and it iteratively applies structure-preserving mutations to the original model, until the model is completely updated. We evaluate the process on real-world feature models. Although our approach does not guarantee to completely update all possible feature models, empirical analysis shows that, on average, more than 80% of requested changes are applied.},

In order to support this task, an interactive search-based approach, automated by a tool named OPLA-Tool, was proposed in a previous work. Through this tool the software architect evaluates the generated solutions during the optimization process. Considering that evaluating PLA is a complex task and search-based algorithms demand a high number of generations, the evaluation of all solutions in all generations cause human fatigue. In this work, we incorporated in OPLA-Tool a Machine Learning (ML) model to represent the architect in some moments during the optimization process aiming to decrease the architect's effort. Through the execution of a quantiqualitative exploratory study it was possible to demonstrate the reduction of the fatigue problem and that the solutions produced at the end of the process, in most cases, met the architect's needs.},

abstract = {Delivering great consumer experiences in competitive market conditions requires software vendors to move away from traditional modes of thinking to an outside-in perspective, one that shifts their business to becoming consumer-centric. Requirements engineers operating in these conditions thus need new means to both capture real preferences of consumers and then relate them to requirements for software customized in different ways to fit anyone. Additionally, because system development models require inputs that are more concrete than abstract, the indistinct values of consumers need to be classified and formalized. To address this challenge, this study aims to establish a conceptual link between preferences of consumers and system requirements, using software product line (SPL) as a means for systematically accommodating the variations within the preferences. The novelty of this study is a conceptual model of consumer preference, which integrates generic value frameworks from both psychology and marketing, and a method for its transformation to requirements for SPL using a goal-oriented RE framework as the mediator. The presented artifacts are grounded in an empirical study related to the development of a system for online education.},

Feature models are widely used for variability and commonality management in software product lines. Feature models are information models where a set of products are represented as a set of features in a single model. The automated analysis of feature models deals with the computer-aided extraction of information from feature models. The literature on this topic has contributed with a set of operations, techniques, tools and empirical results which have not been surveyed until now. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review on the automated analysis of feature models 20 years after of their invention. This paper contributes by bringing together previously disparate streams of work to help shed light on this thriving area. We also present a conceptual framework to understand the different proposals as well as categorise future contributions. We finally discuss the different studies and propose some challenges to be faced in the future.},

abstract = {Many software systems need to exist in multiple variants. Organizations typically develop variants using clone&amp;own---copying and adapting systems towards new requirements. However, while clone &amp; own is a simple and readily available strategy, it does not scale with the number of variants, and then requires a costly reengineering of the cloned variants into a configurable software platform (a.k.a., software product line). Ideally, organizations could rely on decision models or at least on substantial empirical data to assess the costs and benefits of such a re-engineering. Unfortunately, despite decades of research on product lines and platforms, such data is scarce, not least because obtaining it from industrial reengineering efforts is challenging. We address this gap with a study on re-engineering two cases of cloned variants of open-source Android and Java games. Student developers re-engineered the clones into software product lines, logging their activities and costs. They performed the types of activities typically associated with re-engineering, but the activities were intertwined and done iteratively. The costs were relatively similar among both cases, but the used variability mechanism had a substantial impact. Interestingly, beyond a common diffing tool, no dedicated re-engineering tool was particularly useful. We hope that our results support researchers working on re-engineering techniques and decision models, as well as practitioners trying to assess the costs and activities involved in re-engineering a software platform.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) implement features of a product family, from which products can be derived and reconfigured at runtime. This way, systems can alternate their configurations without service interruption. The activation and deactivation of features at runtime pose challenges for the implementation of a DSPL, in particular for handling object states such as runtime changes to object-scoped variables, their value assignments, and the variable properties. To quantify the complexity of this object migration, we propose a systematic code-level measurement approach which harvests feature implementations and the corresponding variability models for code introductions responsible for critical changes to object states.We have applied our measurement process tentatively to data sets representing 9 SPLs implemented using Fuji. This way, we arrived at first insights on object-migration complexity in SPLs. For example, we observed that the number of feature-specific object states is distributed very unequally in Fuji SPLs, with a few objects having an overly complex map of potential object states and the majority of objects potentially seeing transitions between 1 and 5 object states. We also evaluated different tactics of applying SAT solvers to analyze variability models in this context.},

abstract = {Variation occurs in databases in many different forms and contexts. For example, a single database schema evolves over time, data from different sources may be combined, and the various configurations of a software product line (SPL) may have different data needs. While approaches have been developed to deal with many such scenarios, particularly in the fields of database evolution and data integration, there is no solution that treats variation as a general and orthogonal concern in databases. This is a problem when various kinds of variation intersect, such as during the evolution of a SPL. Previously, we have proposed variational databases (VDB) as a general way to represent variation in both the structure and content of databases. Although the model underlying VDB is simple, encoding variation explicitly in databases introduces complexity akin to using preprocessing directives in software. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of VDB and its associated variational query language for encoding different kinds of database variability. We develop two use cases that illustrate how different kinds of variation can be encoded and integrated in VDB, and how the corresponding information needs can be expressed as variational queries. We then use these use cases to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such a direct encoding of variation in data and queries.},

abstract = {Cloud computing technologies can be used to more flexibly provision application resources. By exploiting multi-tenancy, instances can be shared between users, lowering the cost of providing applications. A weakness of current cloud offerings however, is the difficulty of creating customizable applications that retain these advantages. In this article, we define a feature-based cloud resource management model, making use of Software Product Line Engineering techniques, where applications are composed of feature instances using a service-oriented architecture. We focus on how resources can be allocated in a cost-effective way within this model, a problem which we refer to as the feature placement problem. A formal description of this problem, that can be used to allocate resources in a cost-effective way, is provided. We take both the cost of failure to place features, and the cost of using servers into account, making it possible to take energy costs or the cost of public cloud infrastructure into consideration during the placement calculation. Four algorithms that can be used to solve the feature placement problem are defined. We evaluate the algorithm solutions, comparing them with the optimal solution determined using an integer linear problem solver, and evaluating the execution times of the algorithms, making use of both generated inputs and a use case based on three applications. We show that, using our approach a higher degree of multi-tenancy can be achieved, and that for the considered scenarios, taking the relationships between features into account and using application-oriented placement performs 25---40 % better than a purely feature-oriented placement.},

abstract = {The Stochastic Point Location (SPL) problem Oommen is a fundamental learning problem that has recently found a lot of research attention. SPL can be summarized as searching for an unknown point in an interval under faulty feedback. The search is performed via a Learning Mechanism (LM) (algorithm) that interacts with a stochastic Environment which in turn informs it about the direction of the search. Since the Environment is stochastic, the guidance for directions could be faulty. The first solution to the SPL problem, which was pioneered two decades ago by Oommen, relies on discretizing the search interval and performing a controlled random walk on it. The state of the random walk at each step is considered to be the estimation of the point location. The convergence of the latter simplistic estimation strategy is proved for an infinite resolution, i.e., infinite memory. However, this strategy yields rather poor accuracy for low discretization resolutions. In this paper, we present two major contributions to the SPL problem. First, we demonstrate that the estimation of the point location can significantly be improved by resorting to the concept of mutual probability flux between neighboring states along the line. Second, we are able to accurately track the position of the optimal point and simultaneously show a method by which we can estimate the error probability characterizing the Environment. Interestingly, learning this error probability of the Environment takes place in tandem with the unknown location estimation. We present and analyze several experiments discussing the weaknesses and strengths of the different methods.},

abstract = {Product line engineering allows for the rapid development of variants of a domain specific application by using a common set of reusable assets often known as core assets. Variability modeling is a critical issue in product line engineering, where the use of feature modeling is one of most commonly used formalisms. To support an effective and automated derivation of concrete products for a product family, staged configuration has been proposed in the research literature. In this paper, we propose the integration of well-known requirements engineering principles into stage configuration. Being inspired by the well-established Preview requirements engineering framework, we initially propose an extension of feature models with capabilities for capturing business oriented requirements. This representation enables a more effective capturing of stakeholders' preferences over the business requirements and objectives (e.g.,. implementation costs or security) in the form of fuzzy linguistic variables (e.g., high, medium, and low). On top of this extension, we propose a novel method, the Stratified Analytic Hierarchy process, which first helps to rank and select the most relevant high level business objectives for the target stakeholders (e.g., security over implementation costs), and then helps to rank and select the most relevant features from the feature model to be used as the starting point in the staged configuration process. Besides a complete formalization of the process, we define the place of our proposal in existing software product line lifecycles as well as demonstrate the use of our proposal on the widely-used e-Shop case study. Finally, we report on the results of our user study, which indicates a high appreciation of the proposed method by the participating industrial software developers. The tool support for S-AHP is also introduced.},

abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an established technology and has the potential, in a variety of applications, to significantly reduce cost and improve performance. RFID may dramatically change an organization's capacity to obtain real-time information concerning the location and properties of tagged people or objects. However, simply adding RFID to an existing process is a losing proposition. The entire process should be reconsidered in order to take advantage of real-time inventory data and the near real-time tracking and management of inventory. As RFID-enabled applications will fulfill similar tasks across a range of processes adapted to use the data gained from RFID tags, they can be considered as software products derived from a common infrastructure and assets that capture specific abstractions in the domain. That is, it may be appropriate to design RFID-enabled applications as elements of a product line. This paper discusses product line architecture for RFID-enabled applications. In developing this architecture, common activities are identified among the RFID-enabled applications and the variability in the common activities is analyzed in detail using variation point concepts. A product line architecture explicitly representing commonality and variability is described using UML activity diagrams. Sharing a common architecture and reusing assets to deploy recurrent services may be considered an advantage in terms of economic significance and overall quality.},

abstract = {In software performance engineering, what-if scenarios, architecture optimization, capacity planning, run-time adaptation, and uncertainty management of realistic models typically require the evaluation of many instances. Effective analysis is however hindered by two orthogonal sources of complexity. The first is the infamous problem of state space explosion---the analysis of a single model becomes intractable with its size. The second is due to massive parameter spaces to be explored, but such that computations cannot be reused across model instances. In this paper, we efficiently analyze many queuing models with the distinctive feature of more accurately capturing variability and uncertainty of execution rates by incorporating general (i.e., non-exponential) distributions. Applying product-line engineering methods, we consider a family of models generated by a core that evolves into concrete instances by applying simple delta operations affecting both the topology and the model's parameters. State explosion is tackled by turning to a scalable approximation based on ordinary differential equations. The entire model space is analyzed in a family-based fashion, i.e., at once using an efficient symbolic solution of a super-model that subsumes every concrete instance. Extensive numerical tests show that this is orders of magnitude faster than a naive instance-by-instance analysis.},

abstract = {In recent years, product line development has increasingly received attention in industry as it enables software-developing organizations to reduce both cost and time of developing and maintaining increasingly complex systems as well as to address the demands for individually customized products. Successful product line development requires high quality of reusable artifacts in order to achieve the promised benefits. The unique issues of quality assurance in the context of systematic reuse, however, have not been quantitatively investigated so far. This paper describes a first empirical study comparing the two defect detection techniques, code inspections and functional testing, in the context of product line development. The primary goal of the study was to initially investigate the defect finding potential of the techniques on reusable software components with common and variant features. The major findings of the study are that the two techniques identified different types of defects on variants of a reusable component. Inspections are on average 66.39% more effective and need on average 36.84% less effort to detect a defect We found that both the testing and inspection techniques applied in the experiment were ineffective in identifying variant-specific defects. Overall, the results indicate that the standard quality assurance techniques seem to be insufficient to address special characteristics of reusable components.},

For small-scale problems (roughly less than 100 features), we implement two established approaches to find all exact solutions. For medium-to-large problems (roughly, more than 100 features), we propose one efficient approach that can generate a representation of the entire Pareto front in linear time complexity.

abstract = {In the scientific community, feature models are the de-facto standard for representing variability in software product line engineering. This is different from industrial settings where they appear to be used much less frequently. We and other authors found that in a number of cases, they lack concision, naturalness and expressiveness. This is confirmed by industrial experience. When modelling variability, an efficient tool for making models intuitive and concise are feature attributes. Yet, the semantics of feature models with attributes is not well understood and most existing notations do not support them at all. Furthermore, the graphical nature of feature models' syntax also appears to be a barrier to industrial adoption, both psychological and rational. Existing tool support for graphical feature models is lacking or inadequate, and inferior in many regards to tool support for text-based formats. To overcome these shortcomings, we designed TVL, a text-based feature modelling language. In terms of expressiveness, TVL subsumes most existing dialects. The main goal of designing TVL was to provide engineers with a human-readable language with a rich syntax to make modelling easy and models natural, but also with a formal semantics to avoid ambiguity and allow powerful automation.},

abstract = {ContextVerification techniques are being applied to ensure that software systems achieve desired quality levels and fulfill functional and non-functional requirements. However, applying these techniques to software product lines is challenging, given the exponential blowup of the number of products. Current product-line verification techniques leverage symbolic model checking and variability information to optimize the analysis, but still face limitations that make them costly or infeasible. In particular, state-of-the-art verification techniques for product-line reliability analysis are enumerative which hinders their applicability, given the latent exponential blowup of the configuration space. ObjectiveThe objectives of this paper are the following: (a) we present a method to efficiently compute the reliability of all configurations of a compositional or annotation-based software product line from its UML behavioral models, (b) we provide a tool that implements the proposed method, and (c) we report on an empirical study comparing the performance of different reliability analysis strategies for software product lines. MethodWe present a novel feature-family-based analysis strategy to compute the reliability of all products of a (compositional or annotation-based) software product line. The feature-based step of our strategy divides the behavioral models into smaller units that can be analyzed more efficiently. The family-based step performs the reliability computation for all configurations at once by evaluating reliability expressions in terms of a suitable variational data structure. ResultsOur empirical results show that our feature-family-based strategy for reliability analysis outperforms, in terms of time and space, four state-of-the-art strategies (product-based, family-based, feature-product-based, and family-product-based) for the same property. It is the only one that could be scaled to a 220-fold increase in the size of the configuration space. ConclusionOur feature-family-based strategy leverages both feature- and family-based strategies by taming the size of the models to be analyzed and by avoiding the products enumeration inherent to some state-of-the-art analysis methods.},

However, these methods are agnostic with respect to behaviour: the sampled configurations have thus no reason to satisfy any given behavioural criterion. In this paper, we investigate the behavioural coverage of two structural testing criteria: pairwise and similarity. To do so, we modelled four SPLs in terms of feature diagrams and associated featured transitions systems (FTSs). We then computed state, action and transition coverage for a set of generated configurations. Preliminary results indicate that for relatively small variability models with few cross-tree constraints, structural coverage-driven tools tend to cover large parts of behaviour with less than 8 configurations. Though structural coverage cannot be used directly as a replacement for behavioural driven SPL test generation, opportunities to mix structural and behavioural coverage for efficient and effective SPL testing do exist.},

abstract = {Testing every product of a software product line (SPL) is often not feasible due to the exponential number of products in the number of features. Thus, the order in which products are tested matters, because it can increase the early rate of fault detection. Several approaches have been proposed to prioritize products based on configuration similarity. However, current approaches are oblivious to solution-space differences among products, because they consider only problem-space information. With delta modeling, we incorporate solution-space information in product prioritization to improve the effectiveness of SPL testing. Deltas capture the differences between products facilitating the reasoning about product similarity. As a result, we select the most dissimilar product to the previously tested ones, in terms of deltas, to be tested next. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using an SPL from the automotive domain showing an improvement in the effectiveness of SPL testing.},

abstract = {A set of criteria to characterize mechanisms suitable to implement dynamic variability.A characterization of thirteen DSPL-ready variability mechanisms.Empirical evaluation of OOP and AOP from the perspective of DSPL evolution.Evidence showing that AOP is a feasible strategy to implement DSPL projects. Dynamic Software Product Line (DSPL) engineering is a paradigm aimed at handling adaptations at runtime. An inherent challenge in DSPL engineering is to reduce the design complexity of adaptable software, particularly in terms of evolution. Existing research only recently started to investigate evolution in this field, but does not assess the impact of different implementations under software quality in evolutionary scenarios. This work presents a characterization of thirteen dynamic variability mechanisms. Based on such characterization, we implemented a DSPL using Object-oriented Programming (OOP) mechanisms. From this implementation, we evidenced that DSPL requires changes and extensions to design, in terms of functionality and adaptation capabilities. Since Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) was well ranked according to characterization and some studies have demonstrated the likely synergies between AOP and DSPL, we decided to compare it with OOP. We empirically evaluated how OOP and AOP could affect source code quality from the viewpoint of an evolving DSPL. As a result, AOP yields better results in terms of size, SoC, cohesion, and coupling measures. Conversely, AOP provides lower change propagation impact. Although the packages in AOP were more susceptible to changes than in OOP, we could indicate that AOP may be a feasible strategy for DSPL implementation.},

A software product line is a set of software systems that share a common, managed set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment. The literature reports various software metrics for software product lines developed using object-oriented and aspect-oriented programming. However, after a literature review, we observed that we lack the definition of FOP-specific metrics. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a set of eight novel metrics for feature-oriented programming. These metrics were derived both from our experience in FOP and from existing software metrics. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed metrics by applying them to a software product line.},

Over the last years, many tools have been proposed aiming at synthesize and generate products from a set of reusable assets. These tools adopt different techniques and strategies to implement and automate the product derivation activities. In this paper, we analyzed six modern product derivation tools (Captor, CIDE, GenArch, MSVCM, pure::variants, XVCL) in the context of evolution scenarios of a software product line. Our study has adopted several metrics to analyze the modularity, complexity and stability of product derivation artifacts related to configuration knowledge along different releases of a mobile product line.

We then develop a configuration algorithm using constraint satisfaction techniques over finite domains to generate products that are consistent with respect to their ICS family specifications. We reason about the termination and consistency of our configuration algorithm analytically. We evaluate the effectiveness of our configuration approach by applying it to a real subsea oil production system. Specifically, we have rebuilt a number of existing verified product configurations of our industry partner. Our experience shows that our approach can automatically infer up to 50% of the configuration decisions, and reduces the complexity of making configuration decisions.},

abstract = {Safety-critical systems (such as those in automotive, avionics, railway domains), where a failure can result in accidents with fatal consequences, need to certify their products as per domain-specific safety standards. Safety certification is not only time consuming but also consumes the project budget. Adopting a reuse oriented development and certification paradigm can be highly beneficial in such systems. Though there had been several research efforts on cost models in the context of software reuse as well as software product lines, none of them have addressed the certification related costs. In this paper, we present a cost model for software product lines, which incorporates certification costs as well. We first propose a mathematical model to represent a Software Product Line and then present an approach to compute, using optimisation theory, the set of artifacts that compose a new product assuring an expected level of confidence (that is, a certain Safety Integrity Level) at an optimised cost level. The proposed approach can help developers and software project managers in making efficient design decisions in relation to the choice of the components for a new product variant development as part of a product line.},

abstract = {A product-line architecture (PLA) entails a design reused by a family of products sharing several features. The long-term stability of a PLA largely depends on the modularization of each feature from the design outset. As many features of a product-line crosscut the PLA decomposition, their modularity and stability are often improved with aspect-orientation according to recent studies. However, the use of this technique in proactive design of PLAs is challenging and has rarely been investigated. The problem is that information about the crosscutting nature of features is limited in this case. This paper presents a first study aimed at analyzing the feasibility of deriving stable aspect-oriented PLAs through a proactive design method. Our study relies on a product line and presents an in-depth exploratory analyse. We compare the stability of aspect-oriented and alternative candidates for proactively-designed PLAs. The results indicate that it is possible to derive aspect-oriented PLAs with superior stability based on a proactive design method. In addition, it is possible to anticipate pros and cons of PLAs with aspects when the latter are incorporated at an early design stage.},

abstract = {Component-based approaches and software product lines have been adopted by industry to manage the diversity of configurations on safety-critical software. Safety certification demands compliance with standards. ISO 26262 standard uses the concept of Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) to allocate safety requirements to components of a system under design. Compliance with standards is demonstrated through achieving those ASILs which can be very expensive when requirements are high. While achieving safety certification of variant-intensive components without being unnecessarily stringent or expensive is desirable for economy, it poses challenges to safety engineering. In this paper, we propose an approach to manage the diversity of safety goals and supporting safety certification of software components. Our approach is built upon the integration among ASIL decomposition, software process modeling, and variability management techniques. The approach supports cost-effective safety certification and the efficient tailoring of process models to components according to their ASILs. We evaluated our approach in the automotive domain. The approach is feasible in supporting the management of the diversity of safety goals, and cost-effective safety certification of software components.},

abstract = {A software analysis is a computer program that takes some representation of a software product as input and produces some useful information about that product as output. A software product line encompasses many software product variants, and thus existing analyses can be applied to each of the product variations individually, but not to the entire product line as a whole. Enumerating all product variants and analyzing them one by one is usually intractable due to the combinatorial explosion of the number of product variants with respect to product line features. Several software analyses (e.g., type checkers, model checkers, data flow analyses) have been redesigned/re-implemented to support variability. This usually requires a lot of time and effort, and the variability-aware version of the analysis might have new errors/bugs that do not exist in the original one. Given an analysis program written in a functional language based on PCF, in this paper we present two approaches to transforming (lifting) it into a semantically equivalent variability-aware analysis. A light-weight approach (referred to as shallow lifting) wraps the analysis program into a variability-aware version, exploring all combinations of its input arguments. Deep lifting, on the other hand, is a program rewriting mechanism where the syntactic constructs of the input program are rewritten into their variability-aware counterparts. Compositionally this results in an efficient program semantically equivalent to the input program, modulo variability. We present the correctness criteria for functional program lifting, together with correctness proof sketches of shallow lifting. We evaluate our approach on a set of program analyses applied to the BusyBox C-language product line.},

abstract = {A software product-line comprises a set of products that share a common set of features. These features can be reused to customize a product to satisfy specific needs of certain customers or markets. As the number of possible products increases exponentially for new features, testing all products is infeasible. Existing testing approaches reduce their effort by restricting the number of products (sampling) and improve their effectiveness by considering the order of tests (prioritization). In this paper, we propose a cluster-based prioritization technique to sample similar products with respect to the feature selection. We evaluate our approach using feature models of different sizes and show that cluster-based prioritization can enhance the effectiveness of product-line testing.},

abstract = {The Product Line Architecture (PLA) defines a common design for all products derived from the software product line. PLA design is a high-effort task since it is influenced by several factors, such as feature modularity, PLA variability and extensibility. Given the complexity and variety of such influential factors, the use of search-based algorithms have recently been explored to derive PLA designs in the seminal approach named Multi-Objective Approach for Product-Line Architecture Design (MOA4PLA). MOA4PLA produces a set of alternative PLA designs that improve the different optimized factors. Besides the optimization of these factors, the obtained PLA designs should ideally have no architectural smell. An architectural smell may harm not only the PLA variability and extensibility, but also other non-functional attributes. However, no previous study was performed to investigate if and to what extent state-of-the-art search-based approaches, such as MOA4PLA, adversely introduce architectural smells in resulting designs. Thus, we performed an exploratory investigation about the presence of architectural smells in a set of PLA designs obtained from MOA4PLA. Such an investigation was also useful to derive guidelines for: (i) improving the resulting search-based PLA designs, or (ii) preventing upfront the emergence of architectural smells in PLA designs automatically obtained with search-based approaches.},

abstract = {Context: A software reference architecture is a generic architecture for a class of systems that is used as a foundation for the design of concrete architectures from this class. The generic nature of reference architectures leads to a less defined architecture design and application contexts, which makes the architecture goal definition and architecture design non-trivial steps, rooted in uncertainty. Objective: The paper presents a structured and comprehensive study on the congruence between context, goals, and design of software reference architectures. It proposes a tool for the design of congruent reference architectures and for the analysis of the level of congruence of existing reference architectures. Method: We define a framework for congruent reference architectures. The framework is based on state of the art results from literature and practice. We validate our framework and its quality as analytical tool by applying it for the analysis of 24 reference architectures. The conclusions from our analysis are compared to the opinions of experts on these reference architectures documented in literature and dedicated communication. Results: Our framework consists of a multi-dimensional classification space and of five types of reference architectures that are formed by combining specific values from the multi-dimensional classification space. Reference architectures that can be classified in one of these types have better chances to become a success. The validation of our framework confirms its quality as a tool for the analysis of the congruence of software reference architectures. Conclusion: This paper facilitates software architects and scientists in the inception, design, and application of congruent software reference architectures. The application of the tool improves the chance for success of a reference architecture.},

Moreover, no framework was used to develop it, allowing any researcher to use the SPL without losing time learning some framework. In this work, we implemented an SPL test bed containing 34 functional features has 26.457 lines of code, 1493 methods and 496 classes.},

In the past few years, several variability modeling techniques have been developed, each using its own concepts to model the variability provided by a product family. The publications regarding these techniques were written from different viewpoints, use different examples, and rely on a different technical background. This paper sheds light on the similarities and differences between six variability modeling techniques, by exemplifying the techniques with one running example, and classifying them using a framework of key characteristics for variability modeling. It furthermore discusses the relation between differences among those techniques, and the scope, size, and application domain of product families.},

We introduce SATIBEA, that augments multi-objective search-based optimization with constraint solving to address this problem, evaluating it on five large real-world SPLs, ranging from 1,244 to 6,888 features with respect to three different solution quality indicators and two diversity metrics. The results indicate that SATIBEA statistically significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art (p &lt; 0.01) for all five SPLs on all three quality indicators and with maximal effect size (\^{A}12 = 1.0). We also present results that demonstrate the importance of combining constraint solving with search-based optimization and the significant improvement SATIBEA produces over pure constraint solving. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of SATIBEA: within less than half an hour, it finds thousands of constraint-satisfying optimized software products, even for the largest SPL considered in the literature to date.},

Automation of this process is a must for the software developing companies to improve the quality of project and budget planning. This paper introduces a mapping between COSMIC concept elements and UML conceptual elements and an automation tool in order to capture the information needed for functional software size measurement from UML diagrams in a component based software product line environment (CBPL) that are structured in accordance with the interface based design (IbD) method. The mapping and the tool combined is called PL FSM. The results obtained by manual measurement and automated measurement are compared and the results are observed to be close. As a result of this study, PL FSM approach is validated in CBPL environment at the design stage of software development process. The case studies have been carried out in embedded systems domain.},

In this context, the aim of my research is therefore to propose an efficient collaborative-based runtime approach that relies on recommender techniques to provide accurate and scalable configurations to users. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, I conduct series of experiments on real-world SPLs. In addition, I plan empirically verify through a user case study the usability of the proposed approach.

Multiple feature modeling languages have been proposed that evolved over the last decades to manage industrial-size product lines. However, less expressive languages, solely permitting require and exclude constraints, are permanently and carelessly used in product-line research. We address the problem whether those less expressive languages are sufficient for industrial product lines. We developed an algorithm to eliminate complex cross-tree constraints in a feature model, enabling the combination of tools and algorithms working with different feature model dialects in a plug-and-play manner. However, the scope of our algorithm is limited. Our evaluation on large feature models, including the Linux kernel, gives evidence that require and exclude constraints are not sufficient to express real-world feature models. Hence, we promote that research on feature models needs to consider arbitrary propositional formulas as cross-tree constraints prospectively.},

abstract = {Abstract: Software product line (SPL) engineering is a software engineering approach to building configurable software systems. SPLs commonly use a feature model to capture and document the commonalities and variabilities of the underlying software system. A key challenge when using a feature model to derive a new SPL configuration is determining how to find an optimized feature selection that minimizes or maximizes an objective function, such as total cost, subject to resource constraints. To help address the challenges of optimizing feature selection in the face of resource constraints, this paper presents an approach that uses G enetic A lgorithms for optimized FE ature S election (GAFES) in SPLs. Our empirical results show that GAFES can produce solutions with 86-97% of the optimality of other automated feature selection algorithms and in 45-99% less time than existing exact and heuristic feature selection techniques.},

In the context of the European-wide project FAMILIES we concentrated on techniques used to populate the asset base by recovering assets from existing systems.

The incorporation is a quality-driven process that is backed up by a set of reverse engineering techniques to evaluate the asset's internal quality. The quality assessment of an asset is the critical measurement for industrial development organizations in order to incorporate assets into their product line infrastructure.},

abstract = {A feature model specifies the sets of features that define valid products in a software product line. Recent work has considered the problem of choosing optimal products from a feature model based on a set of user preferences, with this being represented as a many-objective optimization problem. This problem has been found to be difficult for a purely search-based approach, leading to classical many-objective optimization algorithms being enhanced either by adding in a valid product as a seed or by introducing additional mutation and replacement operators that use an SAT solver. In this article, we instead enhance the search in two ways: by providing a novel representation and by optimizing first on the number of constraints that hold and only then on the other objectives. In the evaluation, we also used feature models with realistic attributes, in contrast to previous work that used randomly generated attribute values. The results of experiments were promising, with the proposed (SIP) method returning valid products with six published feature models and a randomly generated feature model with 10,000 features. For the model with 10,000 features, the search took only a few minutes.},

abstract = {Today's software systems are too complex to ensure security after the fact – security has to be built into systems by design. To this end, model-based techniques such as UMLsec support the design-time specification and analysis of security requirements by providing custom model annotations and checks. Yet, a particularly challenging type of complexity arises from the variability of software product lines. Analyzing the security of all products separately is generally infeasible. In this work, we propose SecPL, a methodology for ensuring security in a software product line. SecPL allows developers to annotate the system design model with product-line variability and security requirements. To keep the exponentially large configuration space tractable during security checks, SecPL provides a family-based security analysis. In our experiments, this analysis outperforms the naive strategy of checking all products individually. Finally, we present the results of a user study that indicates the usability of our overall methodology.},

abstract = {A software product line is a set of similar software products that share a common code base. While software product lines can be implemented efficiently using feature-oriented programming, verifying each product individually does not scale, especially if human effort is required (e.g., as in interactive theorem proving). We present a family-based approach of deductive verification to prove the correctness of a software product line efficiently. We illustrate and evaluate our approach for software product lines written in a feature-oriented dialect of Java and specified using the Java Modeling Language. We show that the theorem prover KeY can be used off-the-shelf for this task, without any modifications. Compared to the individual verification of each product, our approach reduces the verification time needed for our case study by more than 85%.},

The results reveal that the CF geometry plays an important role in the transient Joule heating. The heat wave of fast transient conduction is stronger in the narrow region of the CF during the reset process for a high applied voltage and a small top radius of the CF. It is demonstrated that the presented model can predict the nanoscale heat transfer in the transient state and during the reset process in the CBRAM.

abstract = {There are some Quality Attributes (QAs) whose variability is addressed through functional variability in the software architecture. Separately modelling the variability of these QAs from the variability of the base functionality of the application has many advantages (e.g., a better reusability), and facilitates the reconfiguration of the QA variants at runtime. Many factors may vary the QA functionality: variations in the user preferences and usage needs; variations in the non-functional QAs; variations in resources, hardware, or even in the functionality of the base application, that directly affect the product's QAs. In this paper, we aim to elicit the relationships and dependencies between the functionalities required to satisfy the QAs and all those factors that can provoke a reconfiguration of the software architecture at runtime. We follow an approach in which the variability of the QAs is modelled separately from the base application functionality, and propose a dynamic approach to reconfigure the software architecture based on those reconfiguration criteria.},

abstract = {The quality attributes of a system are determined, to a large extend, by the decisions taken early on in the development process, noticeably affecting the specification of its software architecture. This is especially true for attributes such as security, usability, context awareness, etc., that have strong functional implications -- i.e. they require the incorporation of Specific functionality to the application architecture in order to satisfy them. Our approach models functional quality attributes considering that: (1) they are complex enough so as to be modeled by a large set of related concerns and the compositions among them. For instance, security includes authentication, access control, privacy, encryption, auditing, etc; (2) the same quality attributes are required by several applications, and thus should be modeled as separate, ready-to-use (re)usable architectural solutions that final applications can incorporate without "being previously prepared" for it; and (3) not all the concerns that are part of a quality attribute need to be instantiated for a particular application (e.g. only the authentication and access control concerns of security are required). In order to consider all the above requirements, in this paper we present a software product line approach that permits modeling the variability of quality attributes using feature models, and generating different configurations of their software architecture depending on the particular concerns required by each application.},

Product line approaches simplify the handling of software variants while model transformations automate software manipulations such as refactoring, optimization, code generation, etc. While these techniques are well understood independently, combining them to get the benefit of both poses a challenge because most model transformations apply to individual models while model-level product lines represent sets of models. In this paper, we address this challenge by providing an approach for automatically ``lifting'' model transformations so that they can be applied to product lines. We illustrate our approach using a case study and evaluate it through a set of experiments.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPL) promote reuse within an application domain in an organized fashion. Preimplemented software components are arranged according to a product line architecture (PLA). Balancing possibly conflicting quality attributes of all potential products makes PLA design a challenging task. Moreover, if quality attributes are part of the variabilities of the SPL, then a unique PLA may result highly inconvenient for particular configurations. We consider the PLA as a set of architectural decisions organized by the features in the Feature Model. A particular product architecture (PA) is defined as the subset of decisions associated to the chosen features for the product. Architectural knowledge is then reused among products and when new features are required in the SPL. Variability at the quality attribute level will impact the style of the resulting architecture, thus choosing different quality features will produce PAs following different styles, even within the same SPL. We use MDE techniques to operationalize this procedure and we illustrate the technique using the case of a Meshing Tool SPL.},

Efficiently type checking an SPL i.e., checking that all its programs are well-typed is challenging. This paper proposes a novel type checking approach for DOP. Intrinsic complexity of SPL type checking is addressed by providing early detection of type errors and by reducing type checking to satisfiability of a propositional formula. The approach is tunable to exploit automatically checkable DOP guidelines for making an SPL more comprehensible and type checking more efficient. The approach and guidelines are formalized by means of a core calculus for DOP of product lines of Java programs.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is used in generative programming and software product-line engineering to capture the common and variable properties of programs within an application domain. The translation of feature models to propositional logics enabled the use of reasoning systems, such as BDD engines, for the analysis and transformation of such models and interactive configurations. Unfortunately, the size of a BDD structure is highly sensitive to the variable ordering used in its construction and an inappropriately chosen ordering may prevent the translation of a feature model into a BDD representation of a tractable size. Finding an optimal order is NP-hard and has for long been addressed by using heuristics.We review existing general heuristics and heuristics from the hardware circuits domain and experimentally show that they are not effective in reducing the size of BDDs produced from feature models. Based on that analysis we introduce two new heuristics for compiling feature models to BDDs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these heuristics using publicly available and automatically generated models. Our results are directly applicable in construction of feature modeling tools.},

abstract = {Context: The paper addresses the use of a Software Product Line approach in the context of developing software for a high-integrity, regulated domain such as civil aerospace. The success of a Software Product Line approach must be judged on whether useful products can be developed more effectively (lower cost, reduced schedule) than with traditional single-system approaches. When developing products for regulated domains, the usefulness of the product is critically dependent on the ability of the development process to provide approval evidence for scrutiny by the regulating authority. Objective: The objective of the work described is to propose a framework for arguing that a product instantiated using a Software Product Line approach can be approved and used within a regulated domain, such that the development cost of that product would be less than if it had been developed in isolation. Method: The paper identifies and surveys the issues relating the adoption of Software Product Lines as currently understood (including related technologies such as feature modelling, component-based development and model transformation) when applied to high-integrity software development. We develop an argument framework using Goal Structuring Notation to structure the claims made and the evidence required to support the approval of an instantiated product in such domains. Any unsubstantiated claims or missing/sub-standard evidence is identified, and we propose potential approaches or pose research questions to help address this. Results: The paper provides an argument framework supporting the use of a Software Product Line approach within a high-integrity regulated domain. It shows how lifecycle evidence can be collected, managed and used to credibly support a regulatory approval process, and provides a detailed example showing how claims regarding model transformation may be supported. Any attempt to use a Software Product Line approach in a regulated domain will need to provide evidence to support their approach in accordance with the argument outlined in the paper. Conclusion: Product Line practices may complicate the generation of convincing evidence for approval of instantiated products, but it is possible to define a credible Trusted Product Line approach.},

abstract = {Electronics and computer science play a more and more prominent role in automotive technology. In the future the prevalence of those new technologies and the customers' demand for individuality will lead to tremendously large configuration spaces of vehicle control systems. To cope with the resulting complexity in verification, new strategies need to be explored. One likely future challenge will be to determine a set of vehicle configurations, such that the successful verification of this small set implies the correctness of the entire product family. This paper presents a method to address this task, based on exploiting communalities in architecture and requirements. We introduce efficient algorithms with provable quality guarantees for the optimization problems of choosing the minimum set of configurations necessary to verify all possible configurations and choosing the best k configurations to maximize the verification coverage of the entire product family. We discuss extensions of our method which allow requirement priorities and the consideration of configuration costs, and present a technique for automatically determining communalities in architecture and requirements which can be exploited by our optimization methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on an indicator light system product family. In this example a configuration reduction by 60% can be achieved.},

abstract = {Software architecture are designed for developing software systems needed for a diverse of business goals. Consequently, architecture has to deal with a significant amount of variability in functionality and quality attributes to create different products. Due to this variability, the evaluation in software architectures is much more complex, as different alternatives of systems might be developed leading to an expensive and time consuming task. Several methods and techniques have been proposed to evaluate product line architectures (PLAs) aiming to asses whether or not the architecture will lead to the desired quality attributes. However, there is little consensus on the existing evaluations methods is most suitable for evaluating variability in software architectures, instead of only considering PLAs. Understanding and explicitly evaluating variations in architectures is a cost-effective way of mitigating substantial risk to organizations and their software systems. Therefore, the main contribution of this research work is to present the state of the art about means for evaluating software architectures (including, PLAs, software architectures, reference and enterprise architectures) that contain variability information. We conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) to provide an overview and insight to practitioners about the most relevant techniques and methods developed for this evaluation. Results indicate that most evaluation techniques assess variability as a quality attribute in PLAs through scenario-based; however, little is known about their real effectiveness as most studies present gaps and lack of evaluation, which difficult the usage of such techniques in an industrial environment.},

This paper describes a structured method for performing safety analysis on a software product line, building on standard product-line assets: product-line requirements, architecture, and scenarios. The safety-analysis method is bi-directional in that it combines a forward analysis (from failure modes to effects) with a backward analysis (from hazards to contributing causes). Safety-analysis results are converted to XML files to allow automated consistency checking between the forward and backward analysis results and to support reuse of the safety-analysis results throughout the product line. The paper demonstrates and evaluates the method on a safety-critical product-line subsystem, the Door Control System. Results show that the bi-directional safety-analysis method found both missing and incorrect software safety requirements. Some of the new safety requirements affected all the systems in the product line while others affected only some of the systems in the product line. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can handle the challenges to safety analysis posed by variations within a product line.},

It is built in the early stages of SPL development and describes the main features and relationships. The feature model evolves according to the evolution of the SPL. Thus, it is important to build maintainable feature models. In this scenario, measures have been proven useful in the maintainability evaluation of the feature models. This paper presents an exploratory study on the impact of feature models maintainability over the SPL evolution process. In order to support this analysis, we built a dataset containing a compiled set of 21 maintainability structural measures extracted from 16 feature models and respective versions. Although not conclusive, our findings indicate that the feature models maintainability tends to decrease as it evolves. We also identified the most common changes performed in a feature model during its evolution process.},

abstract = {Software architectures are the key to achieving the non-functional requirements NFRs in any software project. In software product line SPL development, it is crucial to identify whether the NFRs for a specific product can be attained with the built-in architectural variation mechanisms of the product line architecture, or whether additional architectural transformations are required. This paper presents a multimodel approach for quality-driven product architecture derivation and improvement QuaDAI. A controlled experiment is also presented with the objective of comparing the effectiveness, efficiency, perceived ease of use, intention to use and perceived usefulness with regard to participants using QuaDAI as opposed to the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method ATAM. The results show that QuaDAI is more efficient and perceived as easier to use than ATAM, from the perspective of novice software architecture evaluators. However, the other variables were not found to be statistically significant. Further replications are needed to obtain more conclusive results.},

abstract = {Modern software often exists in many different, yet similar versions and/or variants, usually derived from a common code base (e.g., via clone-and-own). In the context of product-line engineering, family-based analysis has shown very promising potential for improving efficiency in applying quality-assurance techniques to variant-rich software, as compared to a variant-by-variant approach. Unfortunately, these strategies rely on a product-line representation superimposing all program variants in a syntactically well-formed, semantically sound and variant-preserving manner, which is manually hard to obtain in practice. We demonstrate the SiMPOSE methodology for automatically generating superimpositions of N given program versions and/or variants facilitating family-based analysis of variant-rich software. SiMPOSE is based on a novel N-way model-merging technique operating at the level of control-flow automata (CFA) representations of C programs. CFAs constitute a unified program abstraction utilized by many recent software-analysis tools. We illustrate different merging strategies supported by SiMPOSE, namely variant-by-variant, N-way merging, incremental 2-way merging, and partition-based N/2-way merging, and demonstrate how SiMPOSE can be used to systematically compare their impact on efficiency and effectiveness of family-based unit-test generation. The SiMPOSE tool, the demonstration of its usage as well as related artifacts and documentation can be found at http://pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/projects/variance/simpose.},

This is the significant difference to usual software systems and the reason for additional requirements on the various assets present during software product line engineering. It is imperative that they support the description of the product line as a whole, as well as its instantiation for the derivation of individual products.Literature has already addressed how to create and instantiate generic product line assets, such as domain models and architectures to generate instance specific ones [1, 2, 3], yet little attention has been given on how to actually deal with this genericity at the code level.This paper addresses the issue of handling product line variability at the code level. To this end various implementation approaches are examined with respect to their use in a product line context.},

It uses behavioural variability models, viz., Featured Transition Systems, which enable the optimized generation, configuration and execution of mutants. We provide results, based on models with thousands of transitions, suggesting that our technique is fast and scalable. We found that it outperforms previous approaches by several orders of magnitude and that it makes higher-order mutation practically applicable.},

abstract = {Software product lines are used to develop a set of software products that, while being different, share a common set of features. Feature models are used as a compact representation of all the products (e.g., possible configurations) of the product line. The number of products that a feature model encodes may grow exponentially with the number of features. This increases the cost of testing the products within a product line. Some proposals deal with this problem by reducing the testing space using different techniques. However, a daunting challenge is to explore how the cost and value of test cases can be modeled and optimized in order to have lower-cost testing processes. In this paper, we present TESting vAriAbiLity Intensive Systems (TESALIA), an approach that uses automated analysis of feature models to optimize the testing of variability-intensive systems. We model test value and cost as feature attributes, and then we use a constraint satisfaction solver to prune, prioritize and package product line tests complementing prior work in the software product line testing literature. A prototype implementation of TESALIA is used for validation in an Android example showing the benefits of maximizing the mobile market share (the value function) while meeting a budgetary constraint.},

abstract = {Model-driven engineering advocates the use of models to describe and automate many software development tasks. The syntax of modelling languages is defined by meta-models, making them essential artefacts. A combination of product line engineering methods and meta-models has been proposed to enable specification of modelling language variants, e.g., to describe a range of systems. However, there is a lack of techniques for ensuring syntactic correctness of all meta-models within a family (including their OCL constraints), and semantic correctness related to properties of individual instances of the different variants. The absence of verification methods at the product-line level can cause synthesis of ill-formed meta-models and problematic feature combinations whose effect at the instance level may go unnoticed.  To attack this problem, we propose an approach to lifting both the meta-model syntax checking and the satisfiability checking of properties of individual meta-model instances, to the product-line level. We validate the approach via a prototype tool called Merlin, and report on several experiments that show the advantages of our method w.r.t. an enumerative analysis approach.},

In this contribution we present the results of applying the MoSo-PoLiTe framework at Danfoss Power Electronics A/S to calculate a representative set of product configurations for black box testing purposes. Within this evaluation we use MoSo-PoLiTe's pairwise configuration selection component on the basis of a feature model. This component implements a heuristics finding a minimal subset of configurations covering 100% T-wise feature interaction.

abstract = {A software product line comprises a family of software products that share a common set of features. Testing an entire product-line product-by-product is infeasible due to the potentially exponential number of products in the number of features. Accordingly, several sampling approaches have been proposed to select a presumably minimal, yet sufficient number of products to be tested. Since the time budget for testing is limited or even a priori unknown, the order in which products are tested is crucial for effective product-line testing. Prioritizing products is required to increase the probability of detecting faults faster. In this article, we propose similarity-based prioritization, which can be efficiently applied on product samples. In our approach, we incrementally select the most diverse product in terms of features to be tested next in order to increase feature interaction coverage as fast as possible during product-by-product testing. We evaluate the gain in the effectiveness of similarity-based prioritization on three product lines with real faults. Furthermore, we compare similarity-based prioritization to random orders, an interaction-based approach, and the default orders produced by existing sampling algorithms considering feature models of various sizes. The results show that our approach potentially increases effectiveness in terms of fault detection ratio concerning faults within real-world product-line implementations as well as synthetically seeded faults. Moreover, we show that the default orders of recent sampling algorithms already show promising results, which, however, can still be improved in many cases using similarity-based prioritization.},

abstract = {Context: Software metrics, as one form of static analyses, is a commonly used approach in software engineering in order to understand the state of a software system, in particular to identify potential areas prone to defects. Family-based techniques extract variability information from code artifacts in Software Product Lines (SPLs) to perform static analysis for all available variants. Many different types of metrics with numerous variants have been defined in literature. When counting all metrics including such variants, easily thousands of metrics can be defined. Computing all of them for large product lines can be an extremely expensive process in terms of performance and resource consumption.Objective: We address these performance and resource challenges while supporting customizable metric suites, which allow running both, single system and variability-aware code metrics.Method: In this paper, we introduce a partial parsing approach used for the efficient measurement of more than 42,000 code metric variations. The approach covers variability information and restricts parsing to the relevant parts of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).Conclusions: This partial parsing approach is designed to cover all relevant information to compute a broad variety of variability-aware code metrics on code artifacts containing annotation-based variability, e.g., realized with C-preprocessor statements. It allows for the flexible combination of single system and variability-aware metrics, which is not supported by existing tools. This is achieved by a novel representation of partially parsed product line code artifacts, which is tailored to the computation of the metrics. Our approach consumes considerably less resources, especially when computing many metric variants in parallel.},

abstract = {Nowadays, an increasing number of systems are being developed by integrating products (belonging to different product lines) that communicate with each other through information networks. Cost-effectively supporting Product Line Engineering (PLE) and in particular enabling automation of configuration in PLE is a challenge. Capturing rules is the key for enabling automation of configuration. Product configuration has a direct impact on runtime interactions of communicating products. Such products might be within or across product lines and there usually don't exist explicitly specified rules constraining configurable parameter values of such products. Manually specifying such rules is tedious, time-consuming, and requires expert's knowledge of the domain and the product lines. To address this challenge, we propose an approach named as SBRM that combines multi-objective search with machine learning to mine rules. To evaluate the proposed approach, we performed a real case study of two communicating Video Conferencing Systems belonging to two different product lines. Results show that SBRM performed significantly better than Random Search in terms of fitness values, Hyper-Volume, and machine learning quality measurements. When comparing with rules mined with real data, SBRM performed significantly better in terms of Failed Precision (18%), Failed Recall (72%), and Failed F-measure (59%).},

Our formalization of product line transformations is based on category theory, and concentrates on properties of product line relations instead of their single elements.

The life span of a software product-line architecture is much longer than the one of an ordinary software product and it serves as a basis for a set of related systems. Therefore, the product-line architecture should be adaptable to evolution as well as support a number of different products. All these characteristics set new requirements to the product-line architecture evaluation. This paper highlights the new issues that can arise when evaluating a product-line architecture versus evaluating a single-system architecture, including classifications of relevant attributes in product-line architecture evaluation, new evaluation moments and techniques. These issues are used as components of a framework to survey product-line architecture evaluation methods and metrics.},

abstract = {The individual analysis of each product of a software product line (SPL) leads to redundant analysis steps due to the inherent commonality. Therefore, incremental SPL analyses exploit commonalities and focus on the differences between products to reduce the analysis effort. However, existing techniques are influenced by the order in which products are analyzed. The more similar subsequently analyzed products are, the greater is the potential reduction of the overall analysis effort as similar products imply less differences to be analyzed. Hence, an order of products, where the total number of differences is minimized, facilitates incremental SPL analyses. In this paper, we apply graph algorithms to determine optimized product orders. We capture products as nodes in a graph, where solution-space information defines edge weights between product nodes. We adopt existing heuristics for finding an optimal solution of the traveling salesperson problem to determine a path in the product graph with minimal costs. A path represents an optimized product order w.r.t. minimized differences between all products. We realize a prototype of our approach and evaluate its applicability and performance showing a significant optimization compared to standard and random orders.},

In this tutorial, we, first, present model-based testing as an approach for systematic test case generation, test execution and test result evaluation for single system testing. The central idea of model-based testing is to base all testing activities on an executable model-based test specification. Second, we consider model-based testing for variant-rich software systems and review two model-based software product line testing techniques. Sample-based testing generates a set of representative variants for testing, and variability-aware product line testing uses a family-based test model which contains the model-based specification of all considered product variants.},

These challenges are: (1) the same services are required by most applications for pervasive systems, and thus should be modeled as separate, ready-to-use (re)usable solutions; (2) services need to be customized to the requirements of applications, by generating different versions of the same service containing only the required functionality, and (3) the same service needs to be customized to the different devices in which a same application will run (e.g. with different operating systems, different memory and CPU capacities or different communication technologies). In order to consider all of the above challenges, in this paper we present a software product line approach that permits modelling the variability of these services using feature models, automatically generating different configurations of their software architecture depending on the particular requirements of each application. We use this approach to model typical services of pervasive systems, such as context-awareness and communication, and to evaluate the degree of variability, of reuse and of separation of concerns of these services.},
