abstract = {Product line engineering (PLE) approaches have been followed in industry for hardware and software solutions for more than three decades now. However, the different engineering disciplines (e.g. mechanics, electrics, software) have developed and evolved their approaches within their own realms, which is fine as long as there is no need for integrated approaches. Driven by the increasing complexity of systems, there is a rising need for interdisciplinary systems engineering these days. Companies engineering cyber-physical systems and their components have to integrate product line engineering approaches across the involved engineering disciplines to enable a global optimization of portfolio, solution structures, and assets along their lifecycle. From a bird's-eye view, there is noticeable commonality but also variety in the approaches followed for PLE in the different engineering disciplines, which renders the integration of approaches a non-trivial endeavour. In order to foster the development of integrated PLE approaches, this paper explores, maps, and compares PLE approaches in the field of hardware and software engineering. Furthermore, the paper identifies integration opportunities and challenges. As the paper targets industrial practitioners, it mainly provides references to respective industrial events and material and does not fully cover related work in the respective research communities.},

abstract = {Engineering Software Product Lines may be a strategy to reduce costs and efforts for developing software and increasing business productivity. However, it cannot be considered as a "silver bullet" that applies to all types of organizations. Companies must consider pros and cons to determine sound reasons and justify its adoption. In previous work, we proposed the APPLIES evaluation framework to help decision-makers find arguments that may justify (or not) adopting a product line engineering approach. This paper presents our experience using this framework in a mid-sized software development company with more than 25 years of experience but without previous experience in product line engineering. This industrial experience, conducted as a qualitative empirical evaluation, helped us to evaluate to what extent APPLIES is practical to be used in a real environment and to gather ideas from real potential users to improve the framework.},

abstract = {Product configuration based on a feature model in software product lines is the process of selecting the desired features based on customers’ requirements. In most cases, application engineers focus on the functionalities of the target product during product configuration process whereas the quality attributes are handled until the final product is produced. However, it is costly to fix the problem if the quality attributes have not been considered in the product configuration stage. The key issue of assessing a quality attribute of a product configuration is to measure the impact on a quality attribute made by the set of functional variable features selected in a configuration. Current existing approaches have several limitations, such as no quantitative measurements provided or requiring existing valid products and heavy human effort for the assessment. To overcome theses limitations, we propose an Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) based approach to estimate the relative importance of each functional variable feature on a quality attribute. Based on the relative importance value of each functional variable feature on a quality attribute, the level of quality attributes of a product configuration in software product lines can be assessed. An illustrative example based on the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) software product line is presented to demonstrate how the proposed approach works.},

abstract = {Context: Service-Orientation (SO) is a rapidly emerging paradigm for the design and development of adaptive and dynamic software systems. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) has also gained attention as a promising and successful software reuse development paradigm over the last decade and proven to provide effective solutions to deal with managing the growing complexity of software systems. Objective: This study aims at characterizing and identifying the existing research on employing and leveraging SO and SPLE. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study to identify and analyze related literature. We identified 81 primary studies, dated from 2000-2011 and classified them with respect to research focus, types of research and contribution. Result: The mapping synthesizes the available evidence about combining the synergy points and integration of SO and SPLE. The analysis shows that the majority of studies focus on service variability modeling and adaptive systems by employing SPLE principles and approaches. In particular, SPLE approaches, especially feature-oriented approaches for variability modeling, have been applied to the design and development of service-oriented systems. While SO is employed in software product line contexts for the realization of product lines to reconcile the flexibility, scalability and dynamism in product derivations thereby creating dynamic software product lines. Conclusion: Our study summarizes and characterizes the SO and SPLE topics researchers have investigated over the past decade and identifies promising research directions as due to the synergy generated by integrating methods and techniques from these two areas.},

However, in most cases, the focus of those requirements is limited to the functional requirements. The non-functional requirements are often informally defined and their management does not provide traceability mechanisms for their validation. In this paper, we present a multimodel approach that allows the explicit representation of non-functional requirements for software product lines both at domain engineering, and application engineering levels. The multimodel allows the representation of different viewpoints of a software product line, including the non-functional requirements and the relationships that these non-functional requirements might have with features and functionalities. The feasibility of this approach is illustrated through a specific example from the automotive domain.},

abstract = {A number of product-line analysis approaches lift analyses such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving from the level of single programs to the level of product lines. These approaches share concepts and mechanisms that suggest an unexplored potential for reuse of key analysis steps and properties, implementation, and verification efforts. Despite the availability of taxonomies synthesizing such approaches, there still remains the underlying problem of not being able to describe product-line analyses and their properties precisely and uniformly. We propose a formal framework that models product-line analyses in a compositional manner, providing an overall understanding of the space of family-based, feature-based, and product-based analysis strategies. It defines precisely how the different types of product-line analyses compose and inter-relate. To ensure soundness, we formalize the framework, providing mechanized specification and proofs of key concepts and properties of the individual analyses. The formalization provides unambiguous definitions of domain terminology and assumptions as well as solid evidence of key properties based on rigorous formal proofs. To qualitatively assess the generality of the framework, we discuss to what extent it describes five representative product-line analyses targeting the following properties: safety, performance, dataflow facts, security, and functional program properties.},

We assessed the research type of the papers (academic or industry), the kind of evaluation (application example, empirical, etc.), and the application domain. Also, we assessed which product line life-cycle phases, development practices, and topics the papers address. We present an analysis of the topics covered by academic vs. industry research and discuss the evolution of these topics and their relation over the years.

abstract = {Software product line engineering is a compelling methodology that accomplishes systematic reuse in families of systems by relying on two key principles: (i) the decomposition of complex systems into composable and reusable building blocks (often logical units called features), and (ii) on-demand construction of products and product variants by composing these building blocks.However, unless the stakeholder responsible for product configuration has detailed knowledge of the technical ins and outs of the software product line (e.g., the architectural impact of a specific feature, or potential feature interactions), he is in many cases flying in the dark. Although many initial approaches and techniques have been proposed that take into account quality considerations and involve trade-off decisions during product configuration, no systematic support exists.In this paper, we present a reference architecture for product configuration tooling, providing support for (i) up-front generation of variants, and (ii) quality analysis of these variants. This allows pro-actively assessing and predicting architectural quality properties for each product variant and in turn, product configuration tools can take into account architectural considerations. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of techniques and tactics for dealing with the problem of variant explosion, and as such to maintain practical feasibility of such approaches.We validated and implemented our reference architecture in the context of a real-world industrial application, a product-line for the firmware of an automotive sensor. Our prototype, based on FeatureIDE, is open for extension and readily available.},

abstract = {Handling large-scale software variability is still a challenge for many organizations. After decades of research on variability management concepts, many industrial organizations have introduced techniques known from research, but still lament that pure textbook approaches are not applicable or efficient. For instance, software product line engineering—an approach to systematically develop portfolios of products—is difficult to adopt given the high upfront investments; and even when adopted, organizations are challenged by evolving their complex product lines. Consequently, the research community now mainly focuses on re-engineering and evolution techniques for product lines; yet, understanding the current state of adoption and the industrial challenges for organizations is necessary to conceive effective techniques. In this multiple-case study, we analyze the current adoption of variability management techniques in twelve medium- to large-scale industrial cases in domains such as automotive, aerospace or railway systems. We identify the current state of variability management, emphasizing the techniques and concepts they adopted. We elicit the needs and challenges expressed for these cases, triangulated with results from a literature review. We believe our results help to understand the current state of adoption and shed light on gaps to address in industrial practice.},

This paper presents MOA4PLA, a search-based approach to support the PLA design. It gives a multi-objective treatment to the design problem based on specific PLA metrics. A metamodel to represent the PLA and a novel search operator to improve feature modularization are proposed. Results point out that the application of MOA4PLA leads to PLA designs with well modularized features, contributing to improve features reusability and extensibility. It raises a set of solutions with different design trade-offs that can be used to improve the PLA design.},

abstract = {Mass customization of standardized products has become a trend to succeed in today's market environment. Software Product Lines (SPLs) address this trend by describing a family of software products that share a common set of features. However, choosing the appropriate set of features that matches a user's individual interests is hampered due to the overwhelming amount of possible SPL configurations. Recommender systems can address this challenge by filtering the number of configurations and suggesting a suitable set of features for the user's requirements. In this paper, we propose a context-aware recommender system for predicting feature selections in an extended SPL configuration scenario, i.e. taking nonfunctional properties of features into consideration. We present an empirical evaluation based on a large real-world dataset of configurations derived from industrial experience in the Enterprise Resource Planning domain. Our results indicate significant improvements in the predictive accuracy of our context-aware recommendation approach over a state-of-the-art binary-based approach.},

abstract = {Business calculations like break-even, return on investment, or cost are essential in many domains to support decision making while configuring products. For instance, customers and sales people need to estimate and compare the business value of different product variants. Some product line approaches provide initial support, e.g., by defining quality attributes in relation to features. However, an approach that allows domain engineers to easily define business calculations together with variability models is still lacking. In product configuration, calculation results need to be instantly presented to end users after making configuration choices. Further, due to the often high number of calculations, the presentation of calculation results to end users can be challenging. These challenges cannot be addressed by integrating off-the-shelf applications performing the calculations with product line tools. We thus present an approach based on dedicated calculation models that are related to variability models. Our approach seamlessly integrates business calculations with product configuration and provides support for formatting calculations and calculation results. We use the DOPLER tool suite to deploy calculations together with variability models to end users in product configuration. We evaluate the expressiveness and practical relevance of the approach by investigating the development of business calculations for 15 product lines from the domain of industrial automation.},

abstract = {In software product line engineering, the customers mostly concentrate on the functionalities of the target product during product configuration. The quality attributes of a target product, such as security and performance, are often assessed until the final product is generated. However, it might be very costly to fix the problem if it is found that the generated product cannot satisfy the customers' quality requirements. Although the quality of a generated product will be affected by all the life cycles of product development, feature-based product configuration is the first stage where the estimation or prediction of the quality attributes should be considered. As we know, the key issue of predicting the quality attributes for a product configured from feature models is to measure the interdependencies between functional features and quality attributes. The current existing approaches have several limitations on this issue, such as requiring real products for the measurement or involving domain experts' efforts. To overcome these limitations, we propose a systematic approach of modeling quality attributes in feature models based on domain experts' judgments using the analytic hierarchical process (AHP) and conducting quality aware product configuration based on the captured quality knowledge. Domain experts' judgments are adapted to avoid generating the real products for quality evaluation, and AHP is used to reduce domain experts' efforts involved in the judgments. A prototype tool is developed to implement the concepts of the proposed approach, and a formal evaluation is carried out based on a large-scale case study.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are a mature approach for the derivation of a family of products using systematic reuse. Different combinations of predefined features enable tailoring the product to fit the needs of each customer. These needs are related to functional properties of the system (optional features) as well as non-functional properties (e.g., performance or cost of the final product). In industrial scenarios, the configuration process of a final product is complex and the tool support is usually limited to check functional properties interdependencies. In addition, the importance of nonfunctional properties as relevant drivers during configuration has been overlooked. Thus, there is a lack of holistic paradigms integrating recommendation systems and visualizations that can help the decision makers. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an interrelated set of visualizations for the configuration process filling these gaps. We integrate them as part of the FeatureIDE tool and we evaluate its effectiveness, scalability, and performance.},

abstract = {A software product line is a family of related software products, typically, generated from a set of common assets. Users can select features to derive a product that fulfills their needs. Often, users expect a product to have specific non-functional properties, such as a small footprint or a minimum response time. Because a product line can contain millions of products, it is usually not feasible to generate and measure non-functional properties for each possible product of a product line. Hence, we propose an approach to predict a product's non-functional properties, based on the product's feature selection. To this end, we generate and measure a small set of products, and by comparing the measurements, we approximate each feature's non-functional properties. By aggregating the approximations of selected features, we predict the product's properties. Our technique is independent of the implementation approach and language. We show how already little domain knowledge can improve predictions and discuss trade-offs regarding accuracy and the required number of measurements. Although our approach is in general applicable for quantifiable non-functional properties, we evaluate it for the non-functional property footprint. With nine case studies, we demonstrate that our approach usually predicts the footprint with an accuracy of 98% and an accuracy of over 99% if feature interactions are known.},

abstract = {Context: A software product line is a family of related software products, typically created from a set of common assets. Users select features to derive a product that fulfills their needs. Users often expect a product to have specific non-functional properties, such as a small footprint or a bounded response time. Because a product line may have an exponential number of products with respect to its features, it is usually not feasible to generate and measure non-functional properties for each possible product. Objective: Our overall goal is to derive optimal products with respect to non-functional requirements by showing customers which features must be selected. Method: We propose an approach to predict a product's non-functional properties based on the product's feature selection. We aggregate the influence of each selected feature on a non-functional property to predict a product's properties. We generate and measure a small set of products and, by comparing measurements, we approximate each feature's influence on the non-functional property in question. As a research method, we conducted controlled experiments and evaluated prediction accuracy for the non-functional properties footprint and main-memory consumption. But, in principle, our approach is applicable for all quantifiable non-functional properties. Results: With nine software product lines, we demonstrate that our approach predicts the footprint with an average accuracy of 94%, and an accuracy of over 99% on average if feature interactions are known. In a further series of experiments, we predicted main memory consumption of six customizable programs and achieved an accuracy of 89% on average. Conclusion: Our experiments suggest that, with only few measurements, it is possible to accurately predict non-functional properties of products of a product line. Furthermore, we show how already little domain knowledge can improve predictions and discuss trade-offs between accuracy and required number of measurements. With this technique, we provide a basis for many reasoning and product-derivation approaches.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering practices offer desirable characteristics such as rapid product development, reduced time-to-market, and more affordable development costs as a result of systematic representation of the variabilities of a domain of discourse that leads to methodical reuse of software assets. The development lifecycle of a product line consists of two main phases: domain engineering, which deals with the understanding and formally modeling of the target domain, and application engineering that is concerned with the configuration of a product line into one concrete product based on the preferences and requirements of the stakeholders. The work presented in this paper focuses on the application engineering phase and builds both the theoretical and technological tools to assist the stakeholders in (a) understanding the complex interactions of the features of a product line; (b) eliciting the utility of each feature for the stakeholders and hence exposing the stakeholders' otherwise implicit preferences in a way that they can more easily make decisions; and (c) dynamically building a decision model through interaction with the stakeholders and by considering the structural characteristics of software product line feature models, which will guide the stakeholders through the product configuration process. Initial exploratory empirical experiments that we have performed show that our proposed approach for helping stakeholders understand their feature preferences and its associated staged feature model configuration process is able to positively impact the quality of the end results of the application engineering process within the context of the limited number of participants. In addition, it has been observed that the offered tooling support is able to ease the staged feature model configuration process.},

abstract = {Context: During the definition of software product lines (SPLs) it is necessary to choose the components that appropriately fulfil a product's intended functionalities, including its quality requirements (i.e., security, performance, scalability). The selection of the appropriate set of assets from many possible combinations is usually done manually, turning this process into a complex, time-consuming, and error-prone task. Objective: Our main objective is to determine whether, with the use of modeling tools, we can simplify and automate the definition process of a SPL, improving the selection process of reusable assets. Method: We developed a model-driven strategy based on the identification of critical points (sensitivity points) inside the SPL architecture. This strategy automatically selects the components that appropriately match the product's functional and quality requirements. We validated our approach experimenting with different real configuration and derivation scenarios in a mobile healthcare SPL where we have worked during the last three years. Results: Through our SPL experiment, we established that our approach improved in nearly 98% the selection of reusable assets when compared with the unassisted analysis selection. However, using our approach there is an increment in the time required for the configuration corresponding to the learning curve of the proposed tools. Conclusion: We can conclude that our domain-specific modeling approach significantly improves the software architect's decision making when selecting the most suitable combinations of reusable components in the context of a SPL.},

abstract = {Software product lines (SPL) aim at reducing time-to-market and increasing software quality through extensive, planned reuse of artifacts. An essential activity in SPL is variability management, i.e., defining and managing commonality and variability among member products. Due to the large scale and complexity of today's software-intensive systems, variability management has become increasingly complex to conduct. Accordingly, tool support for variability management has been gathering increasing momentum over the last few years and can be considered a key success factor for developing and maintaining SPLs. While several studies have already been conducted on variability management, none of these analyzed the available tool support in detail. In this work, we report on a survey in which we analyzed 37 existing variability management tools identified using a systematic literature review to understand the tools’ characteristics, maturity, and the challenges in the field. We conclude that while most studies on variability management tools provide a good motivation and description of the research context and challenges, they often lack empirical data to support their claims and findings. It was also found that quality attributes important for the practical use of tools such as usability, integration, scalability, and performance were out of scope for most studies.},

The approach can support product line differences in platforms and functions, and generate both product line code and product code. It is based on a product line implementation mechanism that combines a code generation and separation pattern with an architecture-based code annotation technique.

We improve the performance of the multi-objective optimization of SPLs in Alloy by several orders of magnitude with two techniques.First, we rewrite the model to remove binary relations that map to integers, which enables removing most of the integer atoms from the universe. SPL models often require using large bitwidths, hence the number of integer atoms in the universe can be orders of magnitude more than the other atoms. In our approach, the tuples for these integer-valued relations are computed outside the sat solver before returning the solution to the user. Second, we add a checkpointing facility to Kodkod, which allows the multi-objective optimization algorithm to reuse previously computed internal sat solver state, after backtracking.Together these result in orders of magnitude improvement in using Alloy as a multi-objective optimization tool for software product lines.},

abstract = {Modularity benefits, including the independent maintenance and comprehension of individual modules, have been widely advocated. However, empirical assessments to investigate those benefits have mostly focused on source code, and thus, the relevance of modularity to earlier artifacts is still not so clear (such as requirements and design models). In this paper, we use a multimethod technique, including designed experiments, to empirically evaluate the benefits of modularity in the context of two approaches for specifying product line use case scenarios: PLUSS and MSVCM. The first uses an annotative approach for specifying variability, whereas the second relies on aspect-oriented constructs for separating common and variant scenario specifications. After evaluating these approaches through the specifications of several systems, we find out that MSVCM reduces feature scattering and improves scenario cohesion. These results suggest that evolving a product line specification using MSVCM requires only localized changes. On the other hand, the results of six experiments reveal that MSVCM requires more time to derive the product line specifications and, contrasting with the modularity results, reduces the time to evolve a product line specification only when the subjects have been well trained and are used to the task of evolving product line specifications.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a family of related programs of a domain. The programs of an SPL are distinguished in terms of features, which are end-user visible characteristics of programs. Based on a selection of features, stakeholders can derive tailor-made programs that satisfy functional requirements. Besides functional requirements, different application scenarios raise the need for optimizing non-functional properties of a variant. The diversity of application scenarios leads to heterogeneous optimization goals with respect to non-functional properties (e.g., performance vs. footprint vs. energy optimized variants). Hence, an SPL has to satisfy different and sometimes contradicting requirements regarding non-functional properties. Usually, the actually required non-functional properties are not known before product derivation and can vary for each application scenario and customer. Allowing stakeholders to derive optimized variants requires us to measure non-functional properties after the SPL is developed. Unfortunately, the high variability provided by SPLs complicates measurement and optimization of non-functional properties due to a large variant space. With SPL Conqueror, we provide a holistic approach to optimize non-functional properties in SPL engineering. We show how non-functional properties can be qualitatively specified and quantitatively measured in the context of SPLs. Furthermore, we discuss the variant-derivation process in SPL Conqueror that reduces the effort of computing an optimal variant. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by means of nine case studies of a broad range of application domains (e.g., database management and operating systems). Moreover, we show that SPL Conqueror is implementation and language independent by using SPLs that are implemented with different mechanisms, such as conditional compilation and feature-oriented programming.},

abstract = {Over the last two decades, software product lines have been used successfully in industry for building families of systems of related products, maximizing reuse, and exploiting their variable and configurable options. In a changing world, modern software demands more and more adaptive features, many of them performed dynamically, and the requirements on the software architecture to support adaptation capabilities of systems are increasing in importance. Today, many embedded system families and application domains such as ecosystems, service-based applications, and self-adaptive systems demand runtime capabilities for flexible adaptation, reconfiguration, and post-deployment activities. However, as traditional software product line architectures fail to provide mechanisms for runtime adaptation and behavior of products, there is a shift toward designing more dynamic software architectures and building more adaptable software able to handle autonomous decision-making, according to varying conditions. Recent development approaches such as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) attempt to face the challenges of the dynamic conditions of such systems but the state of these solution architectures is still immature. In order to provide a more comprehensive treatment of DSPL models and their solution architectures, in this research work we provide an overview of the state of the art and current techniques that, partially, attempt to face the many challenges of runtime variability mechanisms in the context of Dynamic Software Product Lines. We also provide an integrated view of the challenges and solutions that are necessary to support runtime variability mechanisms in DSPL models and software architectures.},

abstract = {Dealing with variability, during Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE), means trying to allow software engineers to develop a set of similar applications based on a manageable range of variable functionalities according to expert users’ needs. Particularly, variability management (VM) is an activity that allows flexibility and a high level of reuse during software development. In the last years, we have witnessed a proliferation of methods, techniques and supporting tools for VM in general, and for its analysis in particular. More precisely, a specific field has emerged, named (automated) variability analysis, focusing on verifying variability models across the SPLE’s phases. In this paper, we introduce a systematic literature review of existing proposals (as primary studies) focused on analyzing variability models. We define a classification framework, which is composed of 20 sub-characteristics addressing general aspects, such as scope and validation, as well as model-specific aspects, such as variability primitives, reasoner type. The framework allows to look at the analysis of variability models during its whole life cycle—from design to derivation—according to the activities involved during an SPL development. Also, the framework helps us answer three research questions defined for showing the state of the art and drawing challenges for the near future. Among the more interesting challenges, we can highlight the needs of more applications in industry, the existence of more mature tools, and the needs of providing more semantics in the way of variability primitives for identifying inconsistencies in the models.},

abstract = {Feature models are widely used for modelling variability present in a Software Product Line family. We propose using cardinality-based feature models and clonable features to model and manage the evolution of the structural variability present in pervasive systems, composed by a large variety of heterogeneous devices. The use of clonable features increases the expressiveness of feature models, but also greatly increases the complexity of the resulting configurations. So, supporting the evolution of product configurations becomes an intractable task to do it manually. In this paper, we propose a model driven development process to propagate changes made in an evolved feature model, into existing configurations. Furthermore, our process allows us to calculate the effort needed to perform the evolution changes in the customized products. To do this, we have defined two operators, one to calculate the differences between two configurations and another to create a new configuration from a previous one. Finally, we validate our approach, showing that by using our tool support we can generate new configurations for a family of products with thousands of cloned features.},

abstract = {The specialization of the configuration space of a software system has been considered for targeting specific configuration profiles, usages, deployment scenarios, or hardware settings. The challenge is to find constraints among options' values that only retain configurations meeting a performance objective. Since the exponential nature of configurable systems makes a manual specialization unpractical, several approaches have considered its automation using machine learning, i.e., measuring a sample of configurations and then learning what options' values should be constrained. Even focusing on learning techniques based on decision trees for their built-in explainability, there is still a wide range of possible approaches that need to be evaluated, i.e., how accurate is the specialization with regards to sampling size, performance thresholds, and kinds of configurable systems. In this paper, we compare six learning techniques: three variants of decision trees (including a novel algorithm) with and without the use of model-based feature selection. We first perform a study on 8 configurable systems considered in previous related works and show that the accuracy reaches more than 90% and that feature selection can improve the results in the majority of cases. We then perform a study on the Linux kernel and show that these techniques performs as well as on the other systems. Overall, our results show that there is no one-size-fits-all learning variant (though high accuracy can be achieved): we present guidelines and discuss tradeoffs.},

abstract = {System software can typically be configured at compile time via a comfortable feature-based interface to tailor its functionality towards a specific use case. However, with the growing number of features, this tailoring process becomes increasingly difficult: As a prominent example, the Linux kernel in v3.14 provides nearly 14 000 configuration options to choose from. Even developers of embedded systems refrain from trying to build a minimized distinctive kernel configuration for their device – and thereby waste memory and money for unneeded functionality. In this paper, we present an approach for the automatic use-case specific tailoring of system software for special-purpose embedded systems. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the example of Linux by generating tailored kernels for well-known applications of the Rasperry Pi and a Google Nexus 4 smartphone. Compared to the original configurations, our approach leads to memory savings of 15–70 percent and requires only very little manual intervention.},

abstract = {The evolution of variant-rich systems is a challenging task. To support developers, the research community has proposed a range of different techniques over the last decades. However, many techniques have not been adopted in practice so far. To advance such techniques and to support their adoption, it is crucial to evaluate them against realistic baselines, ideally in the form of generally accessible benchmarks. To this end, we need to improve our empirical understanding of typical evolution scenarios for variant-rich systems and their relevance for benchmarking. In this paper, we establish eleven evolution scenarios in which benchmarks would be beneficial. Our scenarios cover typical lifecycles of variant-rich system, ranging from clone &amp; own to adopting and evolving a configurable product-line platform. For each scenario, we formulate benchmarking requirements and assess its clarity and relevance via a survey with experts in variant-rich systems and software evolution. We also surveyed the existing benchmarking landscape, identifying synergies and gaps. We observed that most scenarios, despite being perceived as important by experts, are only partially or not at all supported by existing benchmarks-a call to arms for building community benchmarks upon our requirements. We hope that our work raises awareness for benchmarking as a means to advance techniques for evolving variant-rich systems, and that it will lead to a benchmarking initiative in our community.},

abstract = {Vulnerabilities in software systems result from faults, which occur at different stages in a software's life cycle, for example, in the design (i.e., undesired feature-interactions), the development (i.e., buffer overflows), or the operation (i.e., configuration errors). Various databases provide detailed information about vulnerabilities in software systems or the way to exploit it, but face severe limitations. The information is scattered across these databases, fluctuates in quality and granularity, and provides only an insight into a single vulnerability per entry. Even for a single software system it is challenging for any security-related stakeholder to determine the threat level, which consists of all vulnerabilities of the software system and its environment (i.e., operating system). Manual vulnerability management is feasible only to a limited extend if we want to identify all configurations that are affected by vulnerabilities, or determine a system's threat level and the resulting risk we have to deal with. For variant-rich systems, we also have to deal with variability, allowing different stakeholders to understand the threats to their particular setup. To deal with this variability, we propose vulnerability feature models, which offer a homogeneous view on all vulnerabilities of a software system. These models and the resulting analyses offer advantages in many disciplines of the vulnerability management process. In this paper, we report the research plan for our project, in which we focus on the model-based evaluation of vulnerabilities. This includes research objectives that take into account the design of vulnerability feature models, their application in the process of vulnerability management, and the impact of evolution, discovery, and verification of vulnerabilities.},

Software configuration, which aims to customize the software for different users (e.g., Linux kernel configuration), is an important and complicated task. In software product line engineering (SPLE), feature oriented domain analysis is adopted and feature model is used to guide the configuration of new product variants. In SPLE, product configuration is an optimal feature selection problem, which needs to find a set of features that have no conflicts and meanwhile achieve multiple design objectives (e.g., minimizing cost and maximizing the number of features). In previous studies, several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were used for the optimal feature selection problem and indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) was proven to be the best MOEA for this problem. However, IBEA still suffers from the issues of correctness and diversity of found solutions. In this paper, we propose a dual-population evolutionary algorithm, named IBED, to achieve both correctness and diversity of solutions. In IBED, two populations are individually evolved with two different types of evolutionary operators, i.e., IBEA operators and differential evolution (DE) operators. Furthermore, we propose two enhancement techniques for existing MOEAs, namely the feedback-directed mechanism to fast find the correct solutions (e.g., solutions that satisfy the feature model constraints) and the preprocessing method to reduce the search space. Our empirical results have shown that IBED with the enhancement techniques can outperform several state-of-the-art MOEAs on most case studies in terms of correctness and diversity of found solutions.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) have recently shown promising potentials as integrated engineering methodology for (self-)adaptive software systems. Based on the software-configuration principles of software product lines, DSPL additionally foster reconfiguration capabilities to continuously adapt software products to ever-changing environmental contexts. However, in most recent works concerned with finding near-optimal reconfiguration decisions, real-time aspects of reconfiguration processes are usually out of scope. In this paper, we present a model-based methodology for specifying and automatically analyzing real-time constraints of reconfiguration decisions in a feature-oriented and compositional way. Those real-time aware DSPL specifications are internally translated into timed automata, a well-founded formalism for real-time behaviors. This representation allows for formally reasoning about consistency and worst-case/best-case execution-time behaviors of sequences of reconfiguration decisions. The technique is implemented in a prototype tool and experimentally evaluated with respect to a set of case studies1.},

abstract = {Abstract: Software product line (SPL) engineering is a software engineering approach to building configurable software systems. SPLs commonly use a feature model to capture and document the commonalities and variabilities of the underlying software system. A key challenge when using a feature model to derive a new SPL configuration is determining how to find an optimized feature selection that minimizes or maximizes an objective function, such as total cost, subject to resource constraints. To help address the challenges of optimizing feature selection in the face of resource constraints, this paper presents an approach that uses G enetic A lgorithms for optimized FE ature S election (GAFES) in SPLs. Our empirical results show that GAFES can produce solutions with 86-97% of the optimality of other automated feature selection algorithms and in 45-99% less time than existing exact and heuristic feature selection techniques.},

However as customer requirements change and new products are added to the product line, software producers recognize that the platform cannot be "stretched" indefinitely and a significant problem is striking a balance between development efficiency by increasing platform commonality and customer dissatisfaction from products with additional undesirable features and properties.One alternative is to develop multiple product lines (MPLs). However the challenge remains about what to include in a multiple product line platform. Drawing upon industrial experience of working with 4 companies, this paper explores the characteristics of the contexts in which MPLs are a viable alternative development strategy and then proposes a framework of approaches to platform development.},

We have been working with our industrial partner for the last three years to develop product line assets for their avionics software product line (SPL) and, recently, we encountered two major challenges regarding certification. Firstly, an individual product must be certified, but each may require a different certification level: there might be variations in the certification requirements according to specific system usage contexts. Secondly, certification involves not only product but also process, as standards such as DO-178B also assess the quality of the development process. In this paper, we propose to include a certification view during feature modelling to provide a better understanding of the relationships between features and a certification level required for each product. The experience of introducing certification into the design model of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) SPL is presented to illustrate some key ideas. We also describe the lessons we have learned from this experience.},

abstract = {A Software Product Line is a set of software systems of a domain, which share some common features but also have significant variability. A feature model is a variability modeling artifact which represents differences among software products with respect to variability relationships among their features. Having a feature model along with a reference model developed in the domain engineering lifecycle, a concrete product of the family is derived by selecting features in the feature model (referred to as the configuration process) and by instantiating the reference model. However, feature model configuration can be a cumbersome task because: 1) feature models may consist of a large number of features, which are hard to comprehend and maintain; and 2) many factors including technical limitations, implementation costs, stakeholders' requirements and expectations must be considered in the configuration process. Recognizing these issues, a significant amount of research efforts has been dedicated to different aspects of feature model configuration such as automating the configuration process. Several approaches have been proposed to alleviate the feature model configuration challenges through applying visualization and interaction techniques. However, there have been limited empirical insights available into the impact of visualization and interaction techniques on the feature model configuration process. In this paper, we present a set of visualization and interaction interventions for representing and configuring feature models, which are then empirically validated to measure the impact of the proposed interventions. An empirical study was conducted by following the principles of control experiments in software engineering and by applying the well-known software quality standard ISO 9126 to operationalize the variables investigated in the experiment. The results of the empirical study revealed that the employed visualization and interaction interventions significantly improved completion time of comprehension and changing of the feature model configuration. Additionally, according to results, the proposed interventions are easy-to-use and easy-to-learn for the participants.},

abstract = {As the complexity and variety of systems and software products have increased, the ability to manage their variability effectively and efficiently became crucial. To this end, variability can be specified either as an integral part of the development artifacts or in a separate orthogonal variability model. Lately, orthogonal variability models attract a lot of attention due to the fact that they do not require changing the complexity of the development artifacts and can be used in conjunction with different development artifacts. Despite this attention and to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study examined the comprehensibility of orthogonal variability models.In this work, we conducted an exploratory experiment to examine potential comprehension problems in two common orthogonal variability modeling languages, namely, Common Variability Language (CVL) and Orthogonal Variability Model (OVM). We examined the comprehensibility of the variability models and their relations to the development artifacts for novice users. To measure comprehensibility we used comprehension score (i.e., percentage of correct solution), time spent to complete tasks, and participants' perception of difficulty of different model constructs. The results showed high comprehensibility of the variability models, but low comprehensibility of the relations between the variability models and the development artifacts. Although the comprehensibility of CVL and OVM was similar in terms of comprehension score and time spent to complete tasks, novice users perceived OVM as more difficult to comprehend.},

abstract = {Changing markets and environments has made the ability to rapidly adapt to these changes a necessity in software systems. However the costs of changing and adapting systems to new requirements still remains an unsolved issue. In this context service-oriented software product lines were introduced with the aim to combine the reusability of software product line with the flexibility of service-oriented architecture. Although this approach helps build flexible software systems with high levels of reuse, certain issues are raised. The main issue is the complexity that a service-oriented product line will face. Developing systems from internal and external assets, taking into consideration the variety and number of these assets, can cause problems in deciding which asset is best suited for the system. To help solve these issues we propose the use of approaches based on artificial intelligence. In this paper we show how swarm intelligence can be used in service-oriented product lines to reduce complexity and find optimal solutions for the development of software systems. We also present an example of the application of swarm intelligence in finding the optimal product for a service-oriented product line.},

However, applying DSPLs in the vital domain of highly context-aware systems, e.g., mobile devices, is obstructed by the inherently limited resources being insufficient to handle large, constrained (re-)configurations spaces. To tackle these drawbacks, we propose a novel model-based approach for designing DSPLs in a way that allows for a trade-off between precomputation of reconfiguration scenarios at development time and on-demand evolution at runtime. Therefore, we (1) enrich feature models with context information to reason about potential context changes, and (2) specify context-aware reconfiguration processes on the basis of a scalable transition system incorporating state space abstractions and incremental refinement at runtime. We illustrate our concepts by means of a smartphone case study and present an implementation and evaluation considering different trade-off metrics.},

abstract = {Software architects typically spend a great deal of time and effort exploring uncertainties, evaluating alternatives, and balancing the concerns of stakeholders. Selecting the best architecture to meet both the functional and non-functional requirements is a critical but difficult task, especially at the early stage of software development when there may be many uncertainties. For example, how will a technology match the operational or performance expectations in reality? This paper presents an approach to building architecture-centric product line. The main objective of the proposed approach is to support effective requirements validation and architectural prototyping for the application-level software. Architectural prototyping is practically essential to architecture design and evaluation. However, architectural prototyping practiced in the field mostly is not used to explore alternatives. Effective construction and evaluation of multiple architecture alternatives is one of the critically challenging tasks. The product line architecture advocated in this paper consists of multiple software architecture alternatives, from which the architect can select and rapidly generate a working application prototype. The paper presents a case study of developing a framework that is primarily built with robust architecture patterns in distributed and concurrent computing and includes variation mechanisms to support various applications even in different domains. The development process of the framework is an application of software product line engineering with an aim to effectively facilitate upfront requirements analysis for an application and rapid architectural prototyping to explore and evaluate architecture alternatives.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) engineering has emerged to provide the means to efficiently model, produce, and maintain multiple similar software variants, exploiting their common properties, and managing their variabilities (differences). With over two decades of existence, the community of SPL researchers and practitioners is thriving, as can be attested by the extensive research output and the numerous successful industrial projects. Education has a key role to support the next generation of practitioners to build highly complex, variability-intensive systems. Yet, it is unclear how the concepts of variability and SPLs are taught, what are the possible missing gaps and difficulties faced, what are the benefits, and what is the material available. Also, it remains unclear whether scholars teach what is actually needed by industry. In this article, we report on three initiatives we have conducted with scholars, educators, industry practitioners, and students to further understand the connection between SPLs and education, that is, an online survey on teaching SPLs we performed with 35 scholars, another survey on learning SPLs we conducted with 25 students, as well as two workshops held at the International Software Product Line Conference in 2014 and 2015 with both researchers and industry practitioners participating. We build upon the two surveys and the workshops to derive recommendations for educators to continue improving the state of practice of teaching SPLs, aimed at both individual educators as well as the wider community.},

abstract = {Mapping problem-space features into solution-space features is a fundamental configuration problem in software product line engineering. A configuration problem is defined as generating the most optimal combination of software features given a requirements specification and given a set of configuration rules. Current approaches however provide little support for expressing complex configuration rules between problem and solution space that support incomplete requirements specifications. In this paper, we propose an approach to model complex configuration rules based on a generalization of the concept of problem-solution feature interactions. These are interactions between solution-space features that only arise in specific problem contexts. The use of an existing tool to support our approach is also discussed: we use the DLV answer set solver to express a particular configuration problem as a logic program whose answer set corresponds to the optimal combinations of solution-space features. We motivate and illustrate our approach with a case study in the field of managing dynamic adaptations in distributed software, where the goal is to generate an optimal protocol for accommodating a given adaptation.},

abstract = {ContextSearch-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is an emerging discipline that focuses on the application of search-based optimization techniques to software engineering problems. Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software systems whose members are distinguished by the set of features each one provides. SPL development practices have proven benefits such as improved software reuse, better customization, and faster time to market. A typical SPL usually involves a large number of systems and features, a fact that makes them attractive for the application of SBSE techniques which are able to tackle problems that involve large search spaces. ObjectiveThe main objective of our work is to identify the quantity and the type of research on the application of SBSE techniques to SPL problems. More concretely, the SBSE techniques that have been used and at what stage of the SPL life cycle, the type of case studies employed and their empirical analysis, and the fora where the research has been published. MethodA systematic mapping study was conducted with five research questions and assessed 77 publications from 2001, when the term SBSE was coined, until 2014. ResultsThe most common application of SBSE techniques found was testing followed by product configuration, with genetic algorithms and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms being the two most commonly used techniques. Our study identified the need to improve the robustness of the empirical evaluation of existing research, a lack of extensive and robust tool support, and multiple avenues worthy of further investigation. ConclusionsOur study attested the great synergy existing between both fields, corroborated the increasing and ongoing interest in research on the subject, and revealed challenging open research questions.},

These specifications along with the stakeholders' configurations and the feature model are transformed into a constraint programming problem, on which decision rules are executed to find a non-conflicting set of solution configurations that are aligned to business objectives. We evaluate CoCo's compositionality and model complexity simplification while using a set of motivating decision scenarios.},

To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid multi-objective optimization algorithm called SMTIBEA that combines the indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) with the satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving. We evaluated the proposed algorithm on five large, constrained, real-world SPLs. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach significantly extends the expressiveness of constraints and simultaneously achieves a comparable performance. Furthermore, we investigate the performance influence of the SMT solving on two evolutionary operators of the IBEA.},

abstract = {Context: Complex software-intensive systems comprise many subsystems that are often based on heterogeneous technological platforms and managed by different organizational units. Multi product lines (MPLs) are an emerging area of research addressing variability management for such large-scale or ultra-large-scale systems. Despite the increasing number of publications addressing MPLs the research area is still quite fragmented. Objective: The aims of this paper are thus to identify, describe, and classify existing approaches supporting MPLs and to increase the understanding of the underlying research issues. Furthermore, the paper aims at defining success-critical capabilities of infrastructures supporting MPLs. Method: Using a systematic literature review we identify and analyze existing approaches and research issues regarding MPLs. Approaches described in the literature support capabilities needed to define and operate MPLs. We derive capabilities supporting MPLs from the results of the systematic literature review. We validate and refine these capabilities based on a survey among experts from academia and industry. Results: The paper discusses key research issues in MPLs and presents basic and advanced capabilities supporting MPLs. We also show examples from research approaches that demonstrate how these capabilities can be realized. Conclusions: We conclude that approaches supporting MPLs need to consider both technical aspects like structuring large models and defining dependencies between product lines as well as organizational aspects such as distributed modeling and product derivation by multiple stakeholders. The identified capabilities can help to build, enhance, and evaluate MPL approaches.},

abstract = {Software architectures are the key to achieving the non-functional requirements NFRs in any software project. In software product line SPL development, it is crucial to identify whether the NFRs for a specific product can be attained with the built-in architectural variation mechanisms of the product line architecture, or whether additional architectural transformations are required. This paper presents a multimodel approach for quality-driven product architecture derivation and improvement QuaDAI. A controlled experiment is also presented with the objective of comparing the effectiveness, efficiency, perceived ease of use, intention to use and perceived usefulness with regard to participants using QuaDAI as opposed to the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method ATAM. The results show that QuaDAI is more efficient and perceived as easier to use than ATAM, from the perspective of novice software architecture evaluators. However, the other variables were not found to be statistically significant. Further replications are needed to obtain more conclusive results.},

abstract = {Context. From recent works on product properties resulting from configurations and the optimisation of these properties, one comes quickly to more complex challenges such as multi-objective optimisation, conflicting objectives, multiple stakeholders, and conflict resolution. The intuition is that Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) can draw from other disciplines that deal with decision spaces and complex decision scenarios.Objectives. We aim to (1) explore links to such disciplines, (2) systematise and compare concepts, and (3) identify opportunities, where SPLE approaches can be enriched.Method. We undertake an exploratory study: Starting from common SPLE activities and artefacts, we identify aspects where we expect to find corresponding counterparts in other disciplines. We focus on Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO), and Design Space Exploration (DSE), and perform a comparison of the key concepts.Results. The resulting comparison relates SPLE activities and artefacts to concepts from MCDA, MOO, and DSE and identifies areas where SPLE approaches can be enriched. We also provide examples of existing work at the intersections of SPLE with the other fields. These findings are aimed to foster the conversation on research opportunities where SPLE can draw techniques from other disciplines dealing with complex decision scenarios.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering concerns itself with domain engineering and application engineering. During domain engineering, the whole product family is modeled with a preferred flavor of feature models and additional models as required (e.g., domain models or scenario-based models). During application engineering, the focus shifts toward a single family member and the configuration of the member's features. Recently, aspectual concepts have been employed to better encapsulate individual features of a Software Product Line (SPL), but the existing body of SPL work does not include a unified reasoning framework that integrates aspect-oriented feature description artifacts with the capability to reason about stakeholders' goals while taking feature interactions into consideration. Goal-oriented SPL approaches have been proposed, but do not provide analysis capabilities that help modelers meet the needs of the numerous stakeholders involved in an SPL while at the same time considering feature interactions. We present an aspect-oriented SPL approach for the requirements phase that allows modelers (a) to capture features, goals, and scenarios in a unified framework and (b) to reason about stakeholders' needs and perform trade-off analyses while considering undesirable interactions that are not obvious from the feature model. The approach is based on the Aspect-oriented User Requirements Notation (AoURN) and helps identify, prioritize, and choose products based on analysis results provided by AoURN editor and analysis tools. We apply the AoURN-based SPL framework to the Via Verde SPL to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach through the selection of a Via Verde product configuration that satisfies stakeholders' needs and results in a high-level, scenario-based specification that is free from undesirable feature interactions.},

We introduce SATIBEA, that augments multi-objective search-based optimization with constraint solving to address this problem, evaluating it on five large real-world SPLs, ranging from 1,244 to 6,888 features with respect to three different solution quality indicators and two diversity metrics. The results indicate that SATIBEA statistically significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art (p &lt; 0.01) for all five SPLs on all three quality indicators and with maximal effect size (\^{A}12 = 1.0). We also present results that demonstrate the importance of combining constraint solving with search-based optimization and the significant improvement SATIBEA produces over pure constraint solving. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of SATIBEA: within less than half an hour, it finds thousands of constraint-satisfying optimized software products, even for the largest SPL considered in the literature to date.},

abstract = {Web services run in complex contexts where arising events may compromise the quality of the whole system. Thus, it is desirable to count on autonomic mechanisms to guide the self-adaptation of service compositions according to changes in the computing infrastructure. One way to achieve this goal is by implementing variability constructs at the language level. However, this approach may become tedious, difficult to manage, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a solution based on a semantically rich variability model to support the dynamic adaptation of service compositions. When a problematic event arises in the context, this model is leveraged for decision-making. The activation and deactivation of features in the variability model result in changes in a composition model that abstracts the underlying service composition. These changes are reflected into the service composition by adding or removing fragments of Business Process Execution Language (WS-BPEL) code, which can be deployed at runtime. In order to reach optimum adaptations, the variability model and its possible configurations are verified at design time using Constraint Programming. An evaluation demonstrates several benefits of our approach, both at design time and at runtime.},

abstract = {Configurable software systems allow stakeholders to derive variants by selecting software and/or hardware features. Performance analysis of feature-based systems has been of large interest in the last few years, however a major research challenge is still to conduct such analysis before achieving full knowledge of the system, namely under a certain degree of uncertainty. In this paper we present an approach to analyze the correlation between selection of features embedding uncertain parameters and system performance. In particular, we provide best and worst case performance bounds on the basis of selected features and, in cases of wide gaps among these bounds, we carry on a sensitivity analysis process aimed at taming the uncertainty of parameters. The application of our approach to a case study in the e-health domain demonstrates how to support stakeholders in the identification of system variants that meet performance requirements.},

abstract = {Domain analysis is crucial and central to software product line engineering (SPLE) as it is one of the main instruments to decide what to include in a product and how it should fit in to the overall software product line. For this reason many domain analysis solutions have been proposed both by researchers and industry practitioners. Domain analysis comprises various modeling and scoping activities. This paper presents a systematic review of all the domain analysis solutions presented until 2007. The goal of the review is to analyze the level of industrial application and/or empirical validation of the proposed solutions with the purpose of mapping maturity in terms of industrial application, as well as to what extent proposed solutions might have been evaluated in terms of usability and usefulness. The finding of this review indicates that, although many new domain analysis solutions for software product lines have been proposed over the years, the absence of qualitative and quantitative results from empirical application and/or validation makes it hard to evaluate the potential of proposed solutions with respect to their usability and/or usefulness for industry adoption. The detailed results of the systematic review can be used by individual researchers to see large gaps in research that give opportunities for future work, and from a general research perspective lessons can be learned from the absence of validation as well as from good examples presented. From an industry practitioner view, the results can be used to gauge as to what extent solutions have been applied and/or validated and in what manner, both valuable as input prior to industry adoption of a domain analysis solution.},

abstract = {Product Line Architecture (PLA) design is a key activity for developing successful Software Product Line (SPL) projects. PLA design is a difficult task, mostly due to the complexity of the software systems that SPLs deal with, and their variabilities. Metamodels have been used to support the representation of assets that compose a PLA, SPL variability and the relationships among them. The goal of this study is to characterize the use of metamodeling on PLA design, aiming to identify the main characteristics of metamodels, the elements used for PLA and variability representation and trace the evolution of metamodels. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify the primary studies on the use of metamodels in PLA Design. Thirty-five studies that proposed metamodels to support PLA design were selected. The review main findings are: (i) it is difficult to identify the existence of research trends because the number of publication varies and metamodels lack standardization; (ii) several metamodels support feature representation; (iii) the majority of studies addressed variability representation with variation points in UML diagrams; and, (iv) five evolution lines that describe how metamodels evolved over the years were identified.},

abstract = {Context: Ambient Intelligence systems domain is an outstanding example of modern systems that are in permanent evolution, as new devices, technologies or facilities are continuously appearing. This means it would be desirable to have a mechanism that helps with the propagation of evolution changes in deployed systems. Objective: We present a software product line engineering process to manage the evolution of FamiWare, a family of middleware for ambient intelligence environments. This process drives the evolution of FamiWare middleware configurations using cardinality-based feature models, which are especially well suited to express the structural variability of ambient intelligence systems. Method: FamiWare uses cardinality-based feature models and clonable features to model the structural variability present in ambient intelligence systems, composed of a large variety of heterogeneous devices. Since the management evolution of configurations with clonable features is manually untreatable due to the high number of features, our process automates it and propagates changes made at feature level to the architectural components of the FamiWare middleware. This is a model driven development process as the evolution management, the propagation of evolution changes and the code generation are performed using some kind of model mappings and transformations. Concretely we present a variability modelling language to map the selection of features to the corresponding FamiWare middleware architectural components. Results: Our process is able to manage the evolution of cardinality-based feature models with thousands of features, something which is not possible to tackle manually. Thanks to the use of the variability language and the automatic code generation it is possible to propagate and maintain a correspondence between the FamiWare architectural model and the code. The process is then able to calculate the architectural differences between the evolved configuration and the previous one. Checking these differences, our process helps to calculate the effort needed to perform the evolution changes in the customized products. To perform those tasks we have defined two operators, one to calculate the differences between two feature model configurations and another to create a new configuration from a previous one. Conclusion: Our process automatically propagates the evolution changes of the middleware family into the existing configurations where the middleware is already deployed and also helps us to calculate the effort in performing the changes in every configuration. Finally, we validated our approach, demonstrating the functioning of the defined operators and showing that by using our tool we can generate evolved configurations for FamiWare with thousands of cloned features, for several case studies.},

abstract = {Many software systems today are configurable, offering customization of functionality by feature selection. Understanding how performance varies in terms of feature selection is key for selecting appropriate configurations that meet a set of given requirements. Due to a huge configuration space and the possibly high cost of performance measurement, it is usually not feasible to explore the entire configuration space of a configurable system exhaustively. It is thus a major challenge to accurately predict performance based on a small sample of measured system variants. To address this challenge, we propose a data-efficient learning approach, called DECART, that combines several techniques of machine learning and statistics for performance prediction of configurable systems. DECART builds, validates, and determines a prediction model based on an available sample of measured system variants. Empirical results on 10 real-world configurable systems demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of DECART. In particular, DECART achieves a prediction accuracy of 90% or higher based on a small sample, whose size is linear in the number of features. In addition, we propose a sample quality metric and introduce a quantitative analysis of the quality of a sample for performance prediction.},

abstract = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied for software product lines (SPLs) to search for optimal or near-optimal solutions that balance multiple objectives. However, MOEAs usually produce invalid solutions that violate the constraints predefined. As invalid solutions are unbuildable in practice, we debate the preservation of invalid solutions during the search. We conduct experiments on seven real-world SPLs, including five largest SPLs hitherto reported and two SPLs with realistic values and constraints of quality attributes. We identify three potential limitations of preserving invalid solutions. Furthermore, based on the state-of-the-art, we design five algorithm variants that adopt different evolutionary operators. By performance evaluation, we provide empirical guidance on how to preserve valid solutions. Our empirical study demonstrates that whether or not to preserve invalid solutions deserves more attention in the community, and in some cases, we have to preserve valid solutions all along the way.},

abstract = {We conducted a systematic mapping study on SPL evolution.We identified 107 relevant contributions on the topic up to mid 2015.We elaborated on the traditional change mini-cycle to classify the contributions.We identified well-established topics, trends and open research issues. CONTEXT. Software Product Lines (SPLs) aim to support the development of a whole family of software products through systematic reuse of shared assets. As SPLs exhibit a long life-span, evolution is an even greater concern than for single-systems. For the purpose of this work, evolution refers to the adaptation of the SPL as a result of changing requirements. Hence, evolution is triggered by requirement changes, and not by bug fixing or refactoring.OBJECTIVE. Research on SPL evolution has not been previously mapped. This work provides a mapping study along Petersen's and Kichenham's guidelines, to identify strong areas of knowledge, trends and gaps.RESULTS. We identified 107 relevant contributions. They were classified according to four facets: evolution activity (e.g., identify, analyze and plan, implement), product-derivation approach (e.g., annotation-based, composition-based), research type (e.g., solution, experience, evaluation), and asset type (i.e., variability model, SPL architecture, code assets and products).CONCLUSION. Analyses of the results indicate that "Solution proposals" are the most common type of contribution (31%). Regarding the evolution activity, "Implement change" (43%) and "Analyze and plan change" (37%) are the most covered ones. A finer-grained analysis uncovered some tasks as being underexposed. A detailed description of the 107 papers is also included.},

abstract = {Mobile applications require to self-adapt their behavior to context changes.We propose a DSPL approach to manage variability at runtime.Configurations are generated using multiobjective evolutionary algorithms.We apply a fix operator to generate only valid configurations at runtime.We demonstrate that this approach is suitable for mobile environments. Mobile applications require dynamic reconfiguration services (DRS) to self-adapt their behavior to the context changes (e.g., scarcity of resources). Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) are a well-accepted approach to manage runtime variability, by means of late binding the variation points at runtime. During the system's execution, the DRS deploys different configurations to satisfy the changing requirements according to a multiobjective criterion (e.g., insufficient battery level, requested quality of service). Search-based software engineering and, in particular, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), can generate valid configurations of a DSPL at runtime. Several approaches use MOEAs to generate optimum configurations of a Software Product Line, but none of them consider DSPLs for mobile devices. In this paper, we explore the use of MOEAs to generate at runtime optimum configurations of the DSPL according to different criteria. The optimization problem is formalized in terms of a Feature Model (FM), a variability model. We evaluate six existing MOEAs by applying them to 12 different FMs, optimizing three different objectives (usability, battery consumption and memory footprint). The results are discussed according to the particular requirements of a DRS for mobile applications, showing that PAES and NSGA-II are the most suitable algorithms for mobile environments.},

abstract = {Context: Many software systems are highly configurable. Different configuration options could lead to varying performances of the system. It is difficult to measure system performance in the presence of an exponential number of possible combinations of these options.Goal: Predicting software performance by using a small configuration sample.Method: This paper proposes Perf-AL to address this problem via adversarial learning. Specifically, we use a generative network combined with several different regularization techniques (L1 regularization, L2 regularization and a dropout technique) to output predicted values as close to the ground truth labels as possible. With the use of adversarial learning, our network identifies and distinguishes the predicted values of the generator network from the ground truth value distribution. The generator and the discriminator compete with each other by refining the prediction model iteratively until its predicted values converge towards the ground truth distribution.Results: We argue that (i) the proposed method can achieve the same level of prediction accuracy, but with a smaller number of training samples. (ii) Our proposed model using seven real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. This help to further promote software configurable performance.Conclusion: Experimental results on seven public real-world datasets demonstrate that PERF-AL outperforms state-of-the-art software performance prediction methods.},

abstract = {Voice control has emerged as a popular method for interacting with smart-devices such as smartphones, smartwatches etc. Popular voice control applications like Siri and Google Now are already used by a large number of smartphone and tablet users. A major challenge in designing a voice control application is that it requires continuous monitoring of user?s voice input through the microphone. Such applications utilize hotwords such as "Okay Google" or "Hi Galaxy" allowing them to distinguish user?s voice command and her other conversations. A voice control application has to continuously listen for hotwords which significantly increases the energy consumption of the smart-devices.To address this energy efficiency problem of voice control, we present AccelWord in this paper. AccelWord is based on the empirical evidence that accelerometer sensors found in today?s mobile devices are sensitive to user?s voice. We also demonstrate that the effect of user?s voice on accelerometer data is rich enough so that it can be used to detect the hotwords spoken by the user. To achieve the goal of low energy cost but high detection accuracy, we combat multiple challenges, e.g. how to extract unique signatures of user?s speaking hotwords only from accelerometer data and how to reduce the interference caused by user?s mobility.We finally implement AccelWord as a standalone application running on Android devices. Comprehensive tests show AccelWord has hotword detection accuracy of 85% in static scenarios and 80% in mobile scenarios. Compared to the microphone based hotword detection applications such as Google Now and Samsung S Voice, AccelWord is 2 times more energy efficient while achieving the accuracy of 98% and 92% in static and mobile scenarios respectively.},

abstract = {Software developers in big and medium-size companies are working with millions of lines of code in their codebases. Assuring the quality of this code has shifted from simple defect management to proactive assurance of internal code quality. Although static code analysis and code reviews have been at the forefront of research and practice in this area, code reviews are still an effort-intensive and interpretation-prone activity. The aim of this research is to support code reviews by automatically recognizing company-specific code guidelines violations in large-scale, industrial source code. In our action research project, we constructed a machine-learning-based tool for code analysis where software developers and architects in big and medium-sized companies can use a few examples of source code lines violating code/design guidelines (up to 700 lines of code) to train decision-tree classifiers to find similar violations in their codebases (up to 3 million lines of code). Our action research project consisted of (i) understanding the challenges of two large software development companies, (ii) applying the machine-learning-based tool to detect violations of Sun’s and Google’s coding conventions in the code of three large open source projects implemented in Java, (iii) evaluating the tool on evolving industrial codebase, and (iv) finding the best learning strategies to reduce the cost of training the classifiers. We were able to achieve the average accuracy of over 99% and the average F-score of 0.80 for open source projects when using ca. 40K lines for training the tool. We obtained a similar average F-score of 0.78 for the industrial code but this time using only up to 700 lines of code as a training dataset. Finally, we observed the tool performed visibly better for the rules requiring to understand a single line of code or the context of a few lines (often allowing to reach the F-score of 0.90 or higher). Based on these results, we could observe that this approach can provide modern software development companies with the ability to use examples to teach an algorithm to recognize violations of code/design guidelines and thus increase the number of reviews conducted before the product release. This, in turn, leads to the increased quality of the final software.},

Knowing in advance which feature selection yields the best performance is difficult because a direct measurement of all possible feature combinations is infeasible. Our work aims at predicting program performance based on selected features. However, when features interact, accurate predictions are challenging. An interaction occurs when a particular feature combination has an unexpected influence on performance. We present a method that automatically detects performance-relevant feature interactions to improve prediction accuracy. To this end, we propose three heuristics to reduce the number of measurements required to detect interactions. Our evaluation consists of six real-world case studies from varying domains (e.g., databases, encoding libraries, and web servers) using different configuration techniques (e.g., configuration files and preprocessor flags). Results show an average prediction accuracy of 95%.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) have recently gained momentum as integrated engineering methodology for (self-)adaptive software. DSPL enhance statically configurable software by enabling run-time reconfiguration to facilitate continuous adaptations to changing environmental contexts. In a previous work, we presented a model-based methodology for specifying and automatically analyzing real-time constraints of reconfiguration decisions in a feature-oriented and compositional way. Internally, we translate real-time-aware DSPL specifications into timed automata serving as input for off-the-shelf model checkers like Uppaal for automatically checking semantic consistency properties. However, due to the very high computational complexity of model checking timed automata, those consistency checks suffer from scalability problems thus obstructing practical applications of the proposed approach. In this paper, we tackle this issue by investigating various kinds of static-analysis techniques that (1) aim to avoid expensive model checker calls by statically detecting certain classes of inconsistencies beforehand and otherwise (2) perform model reduction by detecting and merging equivalence states prior to model checker calls. The results of our experimental evaluation show very promising performance improvements achievable by those techniques, especially by the model-reduction approach.},

To address this concern, we presented a family of four controlled experiments that compares a recently proposed method, the Quality-Driven Architecture Derivation and Improvement (QuaDAI) method against the well-known Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM).Objective: To provide further evidence on the efficiency, effectiveness, and perceived satisfaction of participants using these two software architecture evaluation methods. We report the results of a differentiated internal replication study.Method: The same materials used in the baseline experiments were employed in this replication but the participants were sixteen practitioners. In addition, we used a simpler design to reduce the treatments' application sequences.Results: The participants obtained architectures with better quality when applying QuaDAI, and they found this method to be more useful and likely to be used than ATAM, but no difference in terms of efficiency and perceived ease of use were found.Conclusions: The results are in line with the baseline experiments and support the hypothesis that QuaDAI achieve better results than ATAM when performing architectural evaluations; however, further work is need to improve the methods usability.},

abstract = {Software design is a process of trading off competing objectives. If the user objective space is rich, then we should use optimizers that can fully exploit that richness. For example, this study configures software product lines (expressed as feature maps) using various search-based software engineering methods. As we increase the number of optimization objectives, we find that methods in widespread use (e.g. NSGA-II, SPEA2) perform much worse than IBEA (Indicator-Based Evolutionary Algorithm). IBEA works best since it makes most use of user preference knowledge. Hence it does better on the standard measures (hypervolume and spread) but it also generates far more products with 0% violations of domain constraints. Our conclusion is that we need to change our methods for search-based software engineering, particularly when studying complex decision spaces.},

abstract = {Context: Dependability is a key requirement, especially in safety-critical applications. Many of these applications have changing context and configurations at runtime to achieve functional and quality goals and can be realized as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs). DSPL constitutes an emerging but promising research area. Nevertheless, ensuring dependability in DSPLs remains insufficiently explored, especially in terms of reliability and maintainability. This compromises quality assurance and applicability of DSPLs in safety-critical domains, such as Body Sensor Network (BSN).Objective: To address this issue, we propose an approach to developing reliable and maintainable DSPLs in the context of the BSN domain.Method: Adaptation plans are instances of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) describing reliability goals and adaptability at runtime. These instances are automatically checked for reliability goal satisfiability before being deployed and interpreted at runtime to provide more suitable adaptation goals complying with evolving needs perceived by a domain specialist.Results: The approach is evaluated in the BSN domain. Results show that reliability and maintainability could be provided with execution and reconfiguration times of around 30ms, notification and adaptation plan update time over the network around 5s, and space consumption around 5 MB.Conclusion: The method is feasible at reasonable cost. The incurred benefits are reliable vital signal monitoring for the patientthus providing early detection of serious health issues and the possibility of proactive treatmentand a maintainable infrastructure allowing medical DSL instance update to suit the needs of the domain specialist and ultimately of the patient.},

The architecture of a SPL comprises a model that will result in product architectures, and may include solutions leading to bad (architectural) design. One way to assess such design decisions is through the identification of architectural bad smells, which are properties that prejudice the overall software quality, but are not necessarily faulty or errant. In this paper, we conduct an exploratory study that aims at characterizing bad smells in the context of product line architectures. We analyzed an open source SPL project and extracted its architecture to investigate the occurrence or absence of four smells initially studied in single systems. In addition, we propose a smell specific to the SPL context and discuss possible causes and implications of having those smells in the architecture of a product line. The results indicate that the granularity of the SPL features may influence on the occurrence of smells.},

abstract = {Understanding the influence of configuration options on performance is key for finding optimal system configurations, system understanding, and performance debugging. In prior research, a number of performance-influence modeling approaches have been proposed, which model a configuration option's influence and a configuration's performance as a scalar value. However, these point estimates falsely imply a certainty regarding an option's influence that neglects several sources of uncertainty within the assessment process, such as (1) measurement bias, (2) model representation and learning process, and (3) incomplete data. This leads to the situation that different approaches and even different learning runs assign different scalar performance values to options and interactions among them. The true influence is uncertain, though. There is no way to quantify this uncertainty with state-of-the-art performance modeling approaches. We propose a novel approach, P4, based on probabilistic programming that explicitly models uncertainty for option influences and consequently provides a confidence interval for each prediction of a configuration's performance alongside a scalar. This way, we can explain, for the first time, why predictions may cause errors and which option's influences may be unreliable. An evaluation on 12 real-world subject systems shows that P4's accuracy is in line with the state of the art while providing reliable confidence intervals, in addition to scalar predictions.},

Often, the influences of individual configuration options on performance are unknown. Worse, configuration options may interact, giving rise to a configuration space of possibly exponential size. Addressing this challenge, we propose an approach that derives a performance-influence model for a given configurable system, describing all relevant influences of configuration options and their interactions. Our approach combines machine-learning and sampling heuristics in a novel way. It improves over standard techniques in that it (1) represents influences of options and their interactions explicitly (which eases debugging), (2) smoothly integrates binary and numeric configuration options for the first time, (3) incorporates domain knowledge, if available (which eases learning and increases accuracy), (4) considers complex constraints among options, and (5) systematically reduces the solution space to a tractable size. A series of experiments demonstrates the feasibility of our approach in terms of the accuracy of the models learned as well as the accuracy of the performance predictions one can make with them.},

abstract = {Application-level multi-tenancy is an architectural approach for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications which enables high operational cost efficiency by sharing one application instance among multiple customer organizations (the so-called tenants). However, the focus on increased resource sharing typically results in a one-size-fits-all approach. In principle, the shared application instance satisfies only the requirements common to all tenants, without supporting potentially different and varying requirements of these tenants. As a consequence, multi-tenant SaaS applications are inherently limited in terms of flexibility and variability. This paper presents an integrated service engineering method, called service line engineering, that supports co-existing tenant-specific configurations and that facilitates the development and management of customizable, multi-tenant SaaS applications, without compromising scalability. Specifically, the method spans the design, implementation, configuration, composition, operations and maintenance of a SaaS application that bundles all variations that are based on a common core. We validate this work by illustrating the benefits of our method in the development of a real-world SaaS offering for document processing. We explicitly show that the effort to configure and compose an application variant for each individual tenant is significantly reduced, though at the expense of a higher initial development effort.},

abstract = {Product lines have been employed as a mass customisation method that reduces production costs and time-to-market. Multiple product variants are represented in a product line, however the selection of a particular configuration depends on stakeholders' functional and non-functional requirements. Methods like constraint programming and evolutionary algorithms have been used to support the configuration process. They consider a set of product requirements like resource constraints, stakeholders' preferences, and optimization objectives. Nevertheless, scalability and performance concerns start to be an issue when facing large-scale product lines and runtime environments. Thus, this paper presents a survey that analyses strengths and drawbacks of 21 approaches that support product line configuration. This survey aims to: i) evidence which product requirements are currently supported by studied methods; ii) how scalability and performance is considered in existing approaches; and iii) point out some challenges to be addressed in future research.},

Our finding is based on a co-operative project with a government agency developing a partially-automated variability configurator for an open source software product family. By employing our framework, we realised that the way variations and their management are implemented have to accommodate work practices from the use context as well as development practice, and here especially the cooperation within the development team and between users and developers. The empirical evidence has confirmed our understanding of what is relevant when estimating the evolvability of socially embedded systems. We propose to use our framework in architecture-level design and evaluation in order to take these cooperative relationships into account early in the evolution cycle.},

abstract = {In most IT projects, software developers usually pay attention to functional requirements that satisfy business needs of the system. Non-functional requirements (NFR) such as performance, usability, security, etc. are usually handled ad-hoc during the system testing phase, when it is late and costly to fix problems. Due to the importance and criticality of NFR, I study the problem of modeling NFR for Software Product Lines (SPL), which adds yet an additional dimension of complexity. This paper will survey the software engineering literature, in search of a systematic way to analyze and design NFR, from the perspectives of the concept of commonality and variability of SPL and the characteristics of NFR. Finally, I will propose a methodology based on the extension of Product Line UML-Based Software Engineering (PLUS) techniques, for a unified and automated method to model NFR throughout all phases of SPL engineering.},

The optimization of a Product Line Architecture (PLA) design can be modeled as a multi-objective problem, influenced by many factors, such as feature modularization, extensibility and other design principles. Due to this it has been properly solved in the Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) field. However, previous empirical studies optimized PLA design using the multi-objective and evolutionary algorithm NSGA-II, without applying one of the most important genetic operators: the crossover. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a feature-driven crossover operator that aims at improving feature modularization in PLA design. The proposed operator was applied in two empirical studies using NSGA-II in comparison with another version of NSGA-II that uses only mutation operators. The results show the usefulness and applicability of the proposed operator. The NSGA-II version that applies the feature-driven crossover found a greater diversity of solutions (potential PLA designs), with higher feature-based cohesion, and less feature scattering and tangling.},

abstract = {Due to dynamic variability, identifying the specific conditions under which non-functional requirements (NFRs) are satisfied may be only possible at runtime. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the dynamic treatment of relevant information during the requirements specifications. The associated data can be gathered by monitoring the execution of the application and its underlying environment to support reasoning about how the current application configuration is fulfilling the established requirements. This paper presents a dynamic decision-making infrastructure to support both NFRs representation and monitoring, and to reason about the degree of satisfaction of NFRs during runtime. The infrastructure is composed of: (i) an extended feature model aligned with a domain-specific language for representing NFRs to be monitored at runtime; (ii) a monitoring infrastructure to continuously assess NFRs at runtime; and (iii) a flexible decision-making process to select the best available configuration based on the satisfaction degree of the NRFs. The evaluation of the approach has shown that it is able to choose application configurations that well fit user NFRs based on runtime information. The evaluation also revealed that the proposed infrastructure provided consistent indicators regarding the best application configurations that fit user NFRs. Finally, a benefit of our approach is that it allows us to quantify the level of satisfaction with respect to NFRs specification.},

Furthermore, many variations of a given solution may exist, and choosing the best alternative depends on application-specific high-level goals and non-functional requirements. This paper proposes Concern-Oriented Software Design, a modelling technique that focuses on concerns as units of reuse. A concern groups related models serving the same purpose, and provides three interfaces to facilitate reuse. The variation interface presents the design alternatives and their impact on non-functional requirements. The customization interface of the selected alternative details how to adapt the generic solution to a specific context. Finally, the usage interface specifies the provided behaviour. We illustrate our approach by presenting the concern models of variations of the Observer design pattern, which internally depends on the Association concern to link observers and subjects.},

Feature-based specifications are a special class of specifications that aim at modularity in open-world, feature-oriented systems. The question we address is whether modularity of specifications impairs the ability to detect feature interactions, which cut across feature boundaries. In an exploratory study on 10 feature-oriented systems, we found that the majority of feature interactions could be detected based on feature-based specifications, but some specifications have not been modularized properly and require undesirable workarounds to modularization. Based on the study, we discuss the merits and limitations of feature-based specifications, as well as open issues and perspectives. A goal that underlies our work is to raise awareness of the importance and challenges of feature-based specification.},

abstract = {Modeling the performance of a highly configurable software system requires capturing the influences of its configuration options and their interactions on the system's performance. Performance-influence models quantify these influences, explaining this way the performance behavior of a configurable system as a whole. To be useful in practice, a performance-influence model should have a low prediction error, small model size, and reasonable computation time. Because of the inherent tradeoffs among these properties, optimizing for one property may negatively influence the others. It is unclear, though, to what extent these tradeoffs manifest themselves in practice, that is, whether a large configuration space can be described accurately only with large models and significant resource investment. By means of 10 real-world highly configurable systems from different domains, we have systematically studied the tradeoffs between the three properties. Surprisingly, we found that the tradeoffs between prediction error and model size and between prediction error and computation time are rather marginal. That is, we can learn accurate and small models in reasonable time, so that one performance-influence model can fit different use cases, such as program comprehension and performance prediction. We further investigated the reasons for why the tradeoffs are marginal. We found that interactions among four or more configuration options have only a minor influence on the prediction error and that ignoring them when learning a performance-influence model can save a substantial amount of computation time, while keeping the model small without considerably increasing the prediction error. This is an important insight for new sampling and learning techniques as they can focus on specific regions of the configuration space and find a sweet spot between accuracy and effort. We further analyzed the causes for the configuration options and their interactions having the observed influences on the systems' performance. We were able to identify several patterns across subject systems, such as dominant configuration options and data pipelines, that explain the influences of highly influential configuration options and interactions, and give further insights into the domain of highly configurable systems.},

State-of-the-art performance prediction techniques rely on supervised machine learning for detecting feature interactions, which, in turn, relies on time-consuming performance measurements to obtain training data. By providing information about potentially interacting features, we can reduce the number of required performance measurements and make the overall performance prediction process more time efficient. We expect that information about potentially interacting features can be obtained by analyzing the source code of a highly-configurable system, which is computationally cheaper than performing multiple performance measurements. To this end, we conducted an in-depth qualitative case study on two real-world systems (mbedTLS and SQLite), in which we explored the relation between internal (precisely control-flow) feature interactions, detected through static program analysis, and external (precisely performance) feature interactions, detected by performance-prediction techniques using performance measurements. We found that a relation exists that can potentially be exploited to predict performance interactions.},

As it is often infeasible to analyze each product of a product line individually, researchers have developed analyses, called variability-aware analyses, that consider and exploit variability manifested in a code base. Variability-aware analyses are often significantly more efficient than traditional analyses, but each of them has certain weaknesses regarding applicability or scalability. We present the Product-Line-Analysis model, a formal model for the classification and comparison of existing analyses, including traditional and variability-aware analyses, and lay a foundation for formulating and exploring further, combined analyses. As a proof of concept, we discuss different examples of analyses in the light of our model, and demonstrate its benefits for systematic comparison and exploration of product-line analyses.},

abstract = {Frameworks are tools that promote the reuse of pieces of software within specific domains. An intrinsic property of frameworks is the large amount of intertwined code found across its several modules. This configures an architecture whose modules can hardly be decoupled. Consequently, an application derived from a framework usually carries on the full framework architecture, irrespective of the subset of application requirements. This compromises the maintainability, evolution and reusability of both framework and applications derived from it. To deal with this problem, this paper introduces the concept of Framework Product Lines (FPL). In a FPL, each member - or configuration -- is a framework that contains only a subset of the FPL features according to the application requirements and rules that constrain their composition. Thus, this paper presents the framework product lines concept and shows its use for evolving an application framework towards FPL. Results show preliminary gains in terms of reusability and maintainability in both evolved framework and applications derived from it.},

We present a framework for studying relations between different kinds of interactions.

We performed the evaluation on a set of 15 feature-oriented, Java-based product lines. We observed moderate correlations between the interactions under discussion. This gives us confidence that we can apply our approach to studying other types of external feature interactions (e.g., performance interactions).},

It is usually infeasible to measure the performance of all possible variants, due to feature combinatorics. Previous approaches predict performance based on small samples of measured variants, but it is still open how to dynamically determine an ideal sample that balances prediction accuracy and measurement effort. In this paper, we adapt two widely-used sampling strategies for performance prediction to the domain of configurable systems and evaluate them in terms of sampling cost, which considers prediction accuracy and measurement effort simultaneously. To generate an initial sample, we introduce a new heuristic based on feature frequencies and compare it to a traditional method based on t-way feature coverage. We conduct experiments on six real-world systems and provide guidelines for stakeholders to predict performance by sampling.},

abstract = {Product lines consider related products, their commonalities and their differences. The differences between the single products are also referred to as variability. Consequently, variability is inherent in every product line and makes a key difference as compared to single systems. While, on the requirements level, the methods for analyzing product line variability are understood today, their transition to architecture remains vague. Bringing variability to architecture as an "add-on" is just a provisional solution and forebodes the risk of violating other intentions. This paper presents a systematic approach to integrate variability with product line architecture design. In particular, it promotes variability as an architectural driver, embeds variability requirements in the architecture design framework "Quality-Driven Software Architecting" (QUASAR), and gives guidelines and examples for documenting variability in architectural views.},

abstract = {Context: Software library reuse has significantly increased the productivity of software developers, reduced time-to-market and improved software quality and reusability. However, with the growing number of reusable software libraries in code repositories, finding and adopting a relevant software library becomes a fastidious and complex task for developers.Objective: In this paper, we propose a novel approach called LibFinder to prevent missed reuse opportunities during software maintenance and evolution. The goal is to provide a decision support for developers to easily find "useful" third-party libraries to the implementation of their software systems.Method: To this end, we used the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), a multi-objective search-based algorithm, to find a trade-off between three objectives : 1) maximizing co-usage between a candidate library and the actual libraries used by a given system, 2) maximizing the semantic similarity between a candidate library and the source code of the system, and 3) minimizing the number of recommended libraries.Results: We evaluated our approach on 6083 different libraries from Maven Central super repository that were used by 32,760 client systems obtained from Github super repository. Our results show that our approach outperforms three other existing search techniques and a state-of-the art approach, not based on heuristic search, and succeeds in recommending useful libraries at an accuracy score of 92%, precision of 51% and recall of 68%, while finding the best trade-off between the three considered objectives. Furthermore, we evaluate the usefulness of our approach in practice through an empirical study on two industrial Java systems with developers. Results show that the top 10 recommended libraries was rated by the original developers with an average of 3.25 out of 5.Conclusion: This study suggests that (1) library usage history collected from different client systems and (2) library semantics/content embodied in library identifiers should be balanced together for an efficient library recommendation technique.},

abstract = {Reuse has always been a major goal in software engineering, since it promises large gains in productivity, quality and time to market reduction. Practical experience has shown that substantial reuse has only successfully happened in two cases: libraries, where many generic and small components can be found; and product lines, where domains-specific components can be assembled in different ways to produce variations of a given product.In this paper we examine how product lines have successfully achieved reuse of coarse-grained components, and the underlying factors limiting this approach to narrowly scoped domains. We then build on this insight to present an approach, called software federation, which proposes a mechanism to overcome the identified limitations, and therefore makes reuse of coarse-grained components possible over a larger range of applications. Our approach extends and generalizes the product line approach, extending the concepts and mechanisms available to manage variability. The system is in use in different companies, validating the claims made in this paper.},

edition = {1st},
abstract = {Software Engineering: Architecture-driven Software Development is the first comprehensive guide to the underlying skills embodied in the IEEE's Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) standard. Standards expert Richard Schmidt explains the traditional software engineering practices recognized for developing projects for government or corporate systems. Software engineering education often lacks standardization, with many institutions focusing on implementation rather than design as it impacts product architecture. Many graduates join the workforce with incomplete skills, leading to software projects that either fail outright or run woefully over budget and behind schedule. Additionally, software engineers need to understand system engineering and architecture-the hardware and peripherals their programs will run on. This issue will only grow in importance as more programs leverage parallel computing, requiring an understanding of the parallel capabilities of processors and hardware. This book gives both software developers and system engineers key insights into how their skillsets support and complement each other. With a focus on these key knowledge areas, Software Engineering offers a set of best practices that can be applied to any industry or domain involved in developing software products. A thorough, integrated compilation on the engineering of software products, addressing the majority of the standard knowledge areas and topics Offers best practices focused on those key skills common to many industries and domains that develop software Learn how software engineering relates to systems engineering for better communication with other engineering professionals within a project environment}
