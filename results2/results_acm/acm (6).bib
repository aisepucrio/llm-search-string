abstract = {Current market developments require organizations to produce high-quality tailored software variants while simultaneously coping with increased software complexity. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a well-known approach to manage this variability and complexity, however no step-wise migration process is available allowing a co-existence of SPLE along with established development processes. In this paper, we introduce an incremental SPLE migration strategy and process starting from using the feature model as synchronized product and variant documentation. They can be applied as a first step of SPLE migration along with the continuous software development cycle. We performed initial steps of the process on industrial low voltage drive embedded firmware spanning around few millions lines of code using a commercial SPLE tool and validated short-term benefits by means of stakeholder feedback.},

abstract = {The lack of mature tool support is one of the main reasons that make the industry to be reluctant to adopt Software Product Line (SPL) approaches. A number of systematic literature reviews exist that identify the main characteristics offered by existing tools and the SPL phases in which they can be applied. However, these reviews do not really help to understand if those tools are offering what is really needed to apply SPLs to complex projects. These studies are mainly based on information extracted from the tool documentation or published papers. In this paper, we follow a different approach, in which we firstly identify those characteristics that are currently essential for the development of an SPL, and secondly analyze whether the tools provide or not support for those characteristics. We focus on those tools that satisfy certain selection criteria (e.g., they can be downloaded and are ready to be used). The paper presents a state of practice with the availability and usability of the existing tools for SPL, and defines different roadmaps that allow carrying out a complete SPL process with the existing tool support.},

abstract = {Nowadays, modern cars can be configured by means of a wide range of software configuration options. In this context, we speak about Software Product Lines (SPLs). In almost every modern automotive vehicle safety-critical components like, e.g., an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) are installed. Some SPLs have different safety-critical requirements whereas other SPLs have similar requirements. This paper proposes an approach for the reduction of the complexity of SPLs without loss of safety (aspects) for all participants. For this purpose, a concept has been developed, which clusters products of SPLs with similar safety-critical requirements, i.e., the set of products of an SPLs, which must still be tested, can be reduced immensely. The paper also provides an application example how the reduced set can be used in order to perform a Safety, Security and Timing (SST) based trade-off analysis.},

The use of an incomplete implementation of SPLE's three essential activities temporally improves the productivity of the application developments due to the effect of refactored software, but this gradually decreases through architecture erosion.},

Since the available time for test activities is limited an efficiency improvement is needed to ensure that products have sufficient quality.This paper introduces risk-based testing for software product lines. Our approach is based on risk based testing for single system engineering which is extended with a dimension that captures the percentage of product variants that use a particular development artifact. Based on the risk of development artifacts, the priorities for domain and application engineering are determined. We demonstrate our approach using a case study from an existing product line and discuss tool support.We conclude that the basic ideas behind risk-based testing for product lines are intuitive, pragmatic in nature, and provide the means for practitioners for guiding the test effort.},

abstract = {Product line engineering (PLE) approaches have been followed in industry for hardware and software solutions for more than three decades now. However, the different engineering disciplines (e.g. mechanics, electrics, software) have developed and evolved their approaches within their own realms, which is fine as long as there is no need for integrated approaches. Driven by the increasing complexity of systems, there is a rising need for interdisciplinary systems engineering these days. Companies engineering cyber-physical systems and their components have to integrate product line engineering approaches across the involved engineering disciplines to enable a global optimization of portfolio, solution structures, and assets along their lifecycle. From a bird's-eye view, there is noticeable commonality but also variety in the approaches followed for PLE in the different engineering disciplines, which renders the integration of approaches a non-trivial endeavour. In order to foster the development of integrated PLE approaches, this paper explores, maps, and compares PLE approaches in the field of hardware and software engineering. Furthermore, the paper identifies integration opportunities and challenges. As the paper targets industrial practitioners, it mainly provides references to respective industrial events and material and does not fully cover related work in the respective research communities.},

abstract = {Modern software systems, in particular in mobile and cloud-based applications, exist in many different variants in order to adapt to changing user requirements or application contexts. Software product line engineering allows developing these software systems by managed large-scale reuse in order to achieve shorter time to market. Traditional software product line engineering approaches use a domain variability model which only captures the configuration options of the product variants, but does not provide any guideline for designing and implementing reusable artifacts. In contrast, software taxonomies structure software domains from an abstract specification of the functionality to concrete implementable variants by successive correctness-preserving refinements. In this paper, we propose a novel software product line engineering process based on a taxonomy-based domain analysis. The taxonomy's hierarchy provides guidelines for designing and implementing the product line's reusable artifacts while at the same time specifying possible configuration options. By deriving reusable product line artifacts from a software taxonomy, the well-defined structuring of the reusable artifacts yields improved maintainability and evolvability of the product line.},

abstract = {In order to achieve economies of scale, a Software as a Service (SaaS) should be configurable, multi-tenant efficient, and scalable. But building SaaS with these characteristics comes at a price of having more complex services. Some works in the literature integrate software product line engineering and service-oriented architecture to tackle the complexity of building multi-tenant SaaS. Most of these works focused on centralized approaches that rely on middleware or platforms, but they do not investigate the use of decentralized architectural style. Microservices architecture is an architectural style that relies on small, decentralized, and autonomous services that work together. Thus, this paper investigates the integrated use of microservices architecture and software produt line techniques to develop multi-tenant SaaS. We conducted an empirical study that analyzes the behavior of software reuse during the evolution of a multi-tenant SaaS. This empirical study showed an average software reuse of 62% of lines of code among tenants. We also provide lessons we learned during the the re-engineering and maintenance of such multi-tenant SaaS.},

While a substantial amount of variability realization approaches has already been published on source code level, there is little guidance for practitioners on system model level. Hence, there is major uncertainty in dealing with system changes or concurrent system modeling of related system. Due to a poor modularization and variability realization these model variants are ending up in interwoven and complex system models.In this paper, we aim to raise awareness of the need for appropriate guidance and decision support, identify important contextual factors of MBSE that influence variability realization, and derive well known variability mechanisms used in software coding for their applicability in system modeling.},

abstract = {TSoftware Product Line (SPL) Engineering is a software development paradigm that fosters systematic reuse. It is focused on improving software practices, leading companies to experience benefits, such as reduced time-to-market and effort, and higher quality for the products delivered to customers. However, establishing a SPL is neither a simple nor a cheap task, and may affect several aspects of a software company. Besides, it involves a range of risks that may hinder project success. These have to be managed accordingly, so as to minimize the likelihood of project failure. Despite the importance of Risk Management (RM) for SPL Engineering, little has been published in terms of suitable and structured practices to cope with that. This present paper reports an approach for RM in SPL Engineering, named RiPLERM (Rise Product Line Engineering and Risk Management). The approach presents activities to structure RM in SPL projects, The design of the RiPLE-RM approach elaborated on results from empirical investigations, and was proposed to facilitate the management and provide significant insights that can be used to avoid and solve risks.},

This paper presents our experience using this framework in a mid-sized software development company with more than 25 years of experience but without previous experience in product line engineering. This industrial experience, conducted as a qualitative empirical evaluation, helped us to evaluate to what extent APPLIES is practical to be used in a real environment and to gather ideas from real potential users to improve the framework.},

A service mashup is built from existing services such that the developed service mashup offers added-value through new functionalities. We propose an approach which adopts concepts from software product line engineering and automated AI planning to support the automated composition of service mashups. One of the advantages of our work is that it allows non-experts to build and optimize desired mashups with little knowledge of service composition. We report on the results of the experimentation that we have performed which support the practicality and scalability of our proposed work.},

abstract = {Software reuse has been a goal of the software community since the early days of software engineering. In this context software product line engineering (SPLE) has gained a broad interest in both academic institutions and industry. This trend can also be observed in Turkey. In the recent years an increasing number of software companies in Turkey have adopted a SPLE approach while others are planning to make the transition. This paper summarizes the results of the First Turkish Software Product Line Engineering Workshop that has been organized in Ankara in June 2012. The primary goal of the workshop was to reflect on the state of practice in SPLE in Turkey. For this five leading SPLE companies in Turkey have shared their experiences in adopting SPLE, and using interactive discussions a research agenda for SPLE in Turkey has been defined. We report both on the experiences from the workshop and the resulting research topics.},

abstract = {Cloning is a general approach to create new functionality within variants as well as new system variants. It is a fast, flexible, intuitive, and economical approach to evolve systems in the short run. However, in the long run, the maintenance effort increases. A common solution to this problem is the extraction of a product line from a set of cloned variants. This process requires a detailed analysis of variants to extract variability information. However, clones within a variant are usually not considered in the process, but are also a cause for unsustainable software. This thesis proposes an extractive multi product-line engineering approach to re-establish the sustainable development of software variants. We propose an approach to re-engineer intra-system and inter-system clones into reusable, configurable components stored in an integrated platform and synthesize a matching multilayer feature model.},

abstract = {Companies considering adopting a product line engineering approach should ideally analyze the pros and cons to determine the sound reasons for this decision. In order to support this analysis, in previous work we proposed the APPLIES evaluation framework. This framework provides information to evaluate the convenience of adopting a product line engineering approach.This paper presents an empirical evaluation of APPLIES. This experience includes 18 potential practitioners that used the framework to evaluate the convenience of adopting product line engineering in 19 different companies. The collected evidence was used to evaluate the perceived usefulness, intention to use and ease of use of APPLIES. The results presented increase confidence that APPLIESis a useful tool, but also identify some possibilities for improvement. In addition, four categories for classifying potential adopters of product line engineering emerged during the analysis of the results: unprepared adopter, potential adopter, ready adopter, and unmotivated adopter. These categories could be useful to classify companies that are considering adopting product line engineering.},

abstract = {In the last years there has been a continuous growth in functionality of geographic information systems GIS resulting in many different software artifacts. Even though each GIS is used in different areas with different objectives, they all share many features and requirements and therefore it is possible to apply techniques based on intensive software reuse, such as software product line engineering SPLE. Although there has been much research on software product line engineering in the last years, the definition of a software product line for the domain of geographic information systems has not been undertaken.In this work we identify the requirements and functionalities of a generic product for a web-based geographic information system, grouping them into commonalities that allow us to reuse many software artifacts, and variabilities that allow use to configure different products. Then, we define the functional and technological architecture of a software product line that uses current technologies for web-based application development. Finally, we design a tool to configure and assemble the components to generate the possible products. The resulting platform is flexible enough to adapt each product to the specific needs of each customer.},

abstract = {Agile software development (ASD) and software product line (SPL) have shown significant benefits for software engineering processes and practices. Although both methodologies promise similar benefits, they are based on different foundations. SPL encourages systematic reuse that exploits the commonalities of various products belonging to a common domain and manages their variations systematically. In contrast, ASD stresses a flexible and rapid development of products using iterative and incremental approaches. ASD encourages active involvement of customers and their frequent feedback. Both ASD and SPL require alternatives to extend agile methods for several reasons such as (1) to manage reusability and variability across the products of any domain, (2) to avoid the risk of developing core assets that will become obsolete and not used in future projects, and (3) to meet the requirements of changing markets. This motivates the researchers for the integration of ASD and SPL approaches. As a result, an innovative approach called agile product line engineering (APLE) by integrating SPL and ASD has been introduced. The principal aim of APLE is to maximize the benefits of ASD and SPL and address the shortcomings of both. However, combining both is a major challenge. Researchers have proposed a few approaches that try to put APLE into practice, but none of the existing approaches cover all APLE features needed. This paper proposes a new dynamic variability approach for APLE that uses APLE practices for reusing features. The proposed approach (PA) is based on the agile method Scrum and the reactive approach of SPL. In this approach, reusable core assets respond reactively to customer requirements. The PA constructs and develops the SPL architecture iteratively and incrementally. It provides the benefits of reusability and maintainability of SPLs while keeping the delivery-focused approach from agile methods. We conducted a quantitative survey of software companies applying the APLE to assess the performance of the PA and hypotheses of empirical study. Findings of empirical evaluation provide evidence on integrating ASD and SPL and the application of APLE into practices.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering (SPLE) is a methodology for developing a diversity of software products and software intensive systems at lower costs, in shorter time, and with higher quality. SPLE is widely known to develop industrial products such as embedded system. However, for applying SPLE to develop Web applications which have to provide transactional logics for products such as financial products, the biggest issue is the lack of design method and application architecture to execute concurrently for a whole product line on the same runtime. Therefore development cost still tends to increase with frequent changes of the business requirements. We proposed two noble approaches to apply SPLE each for design method and application architecture. Firstly, for design method, we redefined the design scope of product as Product Domain Model, and designed a UML based meta-model which adds the notations of variability. Secondly, for application architecture, we adopted dependency injection technology to execute transaction logics for product line. We also defined a unit of logics for product line as Instance Product. To generate a plenty of resources regarding Instance Product, we created a generator which inputs Product Domain Model. In this paper, we introduce our approaches and evaluation by the pilot development of banking products. The results show that with our approaches, the issue of Web application development can be solved effectively, as well as the additional issue of maintainability.},

abstract = {Software product-line engineering is arguably one of the most successful methods for establishing large portfolios of software variants in an application domain. However, despite the benefits, establishing a product line requires substantial upfront investments into a software platform with a proper product-line architecture, into new software-engineering processes (domain engineering and application engineering), into business strategies with commercially successful product-line visions and financial planning, as well as into re-organization of development teams. Moreover, establishing a full-fledged product line is not always possible or desired, and thus organizations often adopt product-line engineering only to an extent that deemed necessary or was possible. However, understanding the current state of adoption, namely, the maturity or performance of product-line engineering in an organization, is challenging, while being crucial to steer investments. To this end, several measurement methods have been proposed in the literature, with the most prominent one being the Family Evaluation Framework (FEF), introduced almost two decades ago. Unfortunately, applying it is not straightforward, and the benefits of using it have not been assessed so far. We present an experience report of applying the FEF to nine medium- to large-scale product lines in the avionics domain. We discuss how we tailored and executed the FEF, together with the relevant adaptations and extensions we needed to perform. Specifically, we elicited the data for the FEF assessment with 27 interviews over a period of 11 months. We discuss experiences and assess the benefits of using the FEF, aiming at helping other organizations assessing their practices for engineering their portfolios of software variants.},

abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used as a machine learning solution thanks to the complexity of their architecture and hyperparameters-weights. A drawback is the excessive demand for massive computational power during the training process. Not only as a whole but parts of neural networks can also be in charge of certain functionalities. We present a novel challenge in an intersection between machine learning and variability management communities to reuse modules of DNNs without further training. Let us assume that we are given a DNN for image processing that recognizes cats and dogs. By extracting a part of the network, without additional training a new DNN should be divisible with the functionality of recognizing only cats. Existing research in variability management can offer a foundation for a product line of DNNs composing the reusable functionalities. An ideal solution can be evaluated based on its speed, granularity of determined functionalities, and the support for adding variability to the network. The challenge is decomposed in three subchallenges: feature extraction, feature abstraction, and the implementation of a product line of DNNs.},

abstract = {Feature trees have been the standard data structure for representing product diversity in feature-based systems and software product line engineering (PLE). For basic product lines of modest size or complexity, one or several modular feature trees can be sufficient for managing the and resolving the variation present across the engineering assets in the systems engineering 'V' --- from requirements, to design, through implementation, verification, validation, documentation, and more --- in the software, mechanical, and electrical disciplines. However, enterprises seeking to adopt PLE at all levels of their organization, including areas such as product marketing, portfolio planning, manufacturing, supply chain, product sales, product service and maintenance, Internet-of-Things, resource planning, and much more are finding that thousands of nonengineering users need different views and interaction scenarios with a feature diversity representation. This paper describes a feature ontology (a specification of the meaning of terms in the feature modeling realm) that is suitable for managing the feature-based product line engineering and operations in the largest and most complex product line organizations. This ontology is based on layers of abstraction that each incrementally constrain the complexity and combinatorics and targets specific roles in the organization for greater degrees of efficiency, precision, and automation across an entire business enterprise.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a systematic approach for the development of related software products. These products share a common infrastructure but vary with respect to their individual capabilities, called variabilities. Variability management is a key part of SPLE and is responsible for developing, combining and configuring such variabilities. As these activities are inherently complex, SPLE significantly benefits from tool-support. We developed a customizable Eclipse extension for SPLE that consists of around 38 plug-ins. The resulting tool, called EASy-Producer, extends the Eclipse IDE by the capability to support the creation and management of software product line projects. To provide this capability, EASy-Producer utilizes the extension concepts of the Eclipse platform and integrates additional frameworks, like Xtext. In this paper, we share our experience while applying the Eclipse technologies and, in particular, realizing specific capabilities of our tool using the Eclipse framework. The focus of this paper is on our lessons learned regarding managing workspace information and conflicting build mechanism as well as using Eclipse extensions outside of Eclipse. These lessons serve as an input to the Eclipse community and may help other developers in realizing a complex Eclipse extension.},

Software product line engineering approach spans the dimensions of business, architecture, software engineering process and organization. The increasing popularity of software product line engineering in the software industry necessitates a process maturity evaluation methodology. Accordingly, this paper presents a business maturity model of software product line, which is a methodology to evaluate the current maturity of the business dimension of a software product line in an organization. This model examines the coordination between product line engineering and the business aspects of software product line. It evaluates the maturity of the business dimension of software product line as a function of how a set of business practices are aligned with product line engineering in an organization. Using the model presented in this paper, we conducted two case studies and reported the assessment results. This research contributes towards establishing a comprehensive and unified strategy for a process maturity evaluation of software product lines.},

abstract = {Functional quality attributes (FQAs) are those quality attributes that, to be satisfied, require the incorporation of additional functionality into the application architecture. By adding an FQA (e.g., security) we can improve the quality of the final product, but there is also an increase in energy consumption. This paper proposes a solution to help the software architect to generate configurations of FQAs whilst keeping the energy consumed by the application as low as possible. For this, a usage model is defined for each FQA, taking into account the variables that affect the energy consumption, and that the values of these variables change according to the part of the application where the FQA is required. We extend a Software Product Line that models a family of FQAs to incorporate the variability of the usage model and the existing frameworks that implement FQAs. We generate the most eco-efficient configuration of FQAs by selecting the framework with the most suitable characteristics according to the requirements of the application.},

abstract = {Context: Service-Orientation (SO) is a rapidly emerging paradigm for the design and development of adaptive and dynamic software systems. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) has also gained attention as a promising and successful software reuse development paradigm over the last decade and proven to provide effective solutions to deal with managing the growing complexity of software systems. Objective: This study aims at characterizing and identifying the existing research on employing and leveraging SO and SPLE. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study to identify and analyze related literature. We identified 81 primary studies, dated from 2000-2011 and classified them with respect to research focus, types of research and contribution. Result: The mapping synthesizes the available evidence about combining the synergy points and integration of SO and SPLE. The analysis shows that the majority of studies focus on service variability modeling and adaptive systems by employing SPLE principles and approaches. In particular, SPLE approaches, especially feature-oriented approaches for variability modeling, have been applied to the design and development of service-oriented systems. While SO is employed in software product line contexts for the realization of product lines to reconcile the flexibility, scalability and dynamism in product derivations thereby creating dynamic software product lines. Conclusion: Our study summarizes and characterizes the SO and SPLE topics researchers have investigated over the past decade and identifies promising research directions as due to the synergy generated by integrating methods and techniques from these two areas.},

abstract = {Green computing and energy-aware software engineering are trend approaches that try to address the development of applications respectful with the environment. To reduce the energy consumption of an application the developer needs: (i) to identify what are the concerns that will impact more in the energy consumption; (ii) to model the variability of alternative designs and implementations of each concern; (iii) to store and compare the experimentation results related with the energy and time consumption of concerns; (iv) to find out what is the most eco-efficient solution for each concern. HADAS addresses these issues by modelling the variability of energy consuming concerns for different energy contexts. It connects the variability model with a repository that stores energy measurements, providing a Software Product Line (SPL) service, helping developers to reason and find out what are the most eco-friendly configurations. We have an initial implementation of the HADAS toolkit using Clafer. We have tested our implementation with several case studies.},

abstract = {In recent years, manufacturing technology is evolving and progressively becoming more dynamic and complex. This means that manufacturing technology (e.g., based on Industry 4.0) should be able to control the production process at runtime by monitoring physical elements and adapting itself. Such functionality is aimed at increasing production effectiveness and reducing the production cost. We argue that monitoring process can be viewed as a software product line having commonalities and variability. To support our argument, we analyzed and conducted domain analysis of two monitoring systems of Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPSs) from two industrial domains including automated warehouses and press machines. Based on the domain analysis, we present a common solution for monitoring including a software product line. With such product line, a user can configure, monitor, and visualize data of an ICPS at runtime. However, such solution could not handle the dynamic functionality related to monitoring of ICPS. Thus, we propose the use of dynamic product line and present a set of research questions that must be addressed for such solution.},

The intensity (the frequency and the amount) in which developers change variability information in these different types of artifacts is currently unknown. In this paper, we present a fine-grained approach for the variability-centric extraction and analysis of changes to code, build, and variability model artifacts introduced by commits. This approach complements existing work that is typically based on a feature-perspective and, thus, abstracts from this level of detail. Further, it provides a detailed understanding of the intensity of changes affecting variability information in these types of artifacts. We apply our approach to the Linux kernel revealing that changes to variability information occur infrequently and only affect small parts of the analyzed artifacts. Further, we outline how these results may improve certain analysis and verification tasks during SPL evolution.},

abstract = {Feature Models encapsulate functionalities and quality properties of a product family. The employment of feature models for managing variability and commonality of large-scale product families raises an important question: on what basis should the features of a product family be selected for a target software application, which is going to be derived from the product family. Thus, the selection of the most suitable features for a specific application requires the understanding of its stakeholders' intentions and also the relationship between their intentions and the available software features. To address this important issue, we adopt a standard goal-oriented requirements engineering framework, i.e., the i* framework, for identifying stakeholders' intentions and propose an approach for explicitly mapping and bridging between the features of a product family and the goals and objectives of the stakeholders. We propose a novel approach to automatically preconfigure a given feature model based on the objectives of the target product stakeholders. Also, our approach is able to elucidate the rationale behind the selection of the most important features of a family for a target application.},

isbn = {9780494893104},
publisher = {Carleton University},
address = {CAN},
abstract = {A  Software Product Line  (SPL) is a set of similar software systems that share a common set of features satisfying a particular domain, and are built from a shared set of software assets using a common means of production. This research proposes to integrate performance analysis in the early phases of the model-driven development process of SPL. We start by adding generic performance annotations to the UML model representing the set of core reusable SPL assets using the MARTE Profile adopted by OMG. A model transformation realized in Atlas Transformation Language (ATL), derives the UML model of a specific product with concrete performance annotations from the SPL model, which is further transformed into a performance model by using a previously developed transformation called PUMA. The automatic derivation of a specific product model based on a given feature configuration is enabled through the mapping between features from the feature model and their realizations in the design model. An efficient mapping technique is proposed that aims to minimize the amount of explicit feature annotations in the UML model of SPL. Implicit feature mapping is inferred during product derivation from the relationships between annotated and non-annotated model elements as defined in the UML metamodel. The mapping technique is used to derive automatically a given product model. Performance is a run-time property of the deployed system and depends on other factors that are external to the design model, characterizing the underlying platforms and run-time environment. Performance completions provide a means to extend the modeling constructs of a system by including the influence of these factors. The variability space of the performance completions is covered and represented through Performance Completion-feature model (PC-feature model). Dealing manually with a large number of performance parameters annotating a UML+MARTE product model is an error-prone process. A model-driven user-friendly technique is proposed to automatically collect all generic performance parameters that need binding from the generated product model and present them to developers in a spreadsheet format, together with context and guiding information where each PC-feature is mapped to certain MARTE annotations corresponding to UML model elements in the product model.},

Then, we propose a framework for feature and relationship extraction, which overcomes the identified limitations and is built upon state-of-the-art open-source NLP tools.

In order to effectively maintain and develop these product variants, Product-Line Engineering methods are often considered, while Model-based Systems Engineering practices are commonly utilized to tackle product complexity. In this paper, we report on an industrial case study concerning the ongoing adoption of Product Line Engineering in the Model-based Systems Engineering environment at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE) in Sweden. In the study, we identify and define a Product Line Engineering process that is aligned with Model-based Systems Engineering activities at the engines control department of Volvo CE. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of the migration from the current development process to a Model-based Product Line Engineering-oriented process. This process, and its implications, are derived by conducting and analyzing interviews with Volvo CE employees, inspecting artifacts and documents, and by means of participant observation. Based on the results of a first system model iteration, we were able to document how Model-based Systems Engineering and variability modeling will affect development activities, work products and stakeholders of the work products.},

abstract = {Software architecture has been a key research area in the software engineering community due to its significant role in creating high-quality software. The trend of developing product lines rather than single products has made the software product line a viable option in the industry. Software product line architecture (SPLA) is regarded as one of the crucial components in the product lines, since all of the resulting products share this common architecture. The increased popularity of software product lines demands a process maturity evaluation methodology. Consequently, this paper presents an architecture process maturity model for software product line engineering to evaluate the current maturity of the product line architecture development process in an organization. Assessment questionnaires and a rating methodology comprise the framework of this model. The objective of the questionnaires is to collect information about the SPLA development process. Thus, in general this work contributes towards the establishment of a comprehensive and unified strategy for the process maturity evaluation of software product line engineering. Furthermore, we conducted two case studies and reported the assessment results, which show the maturity of the architecture development process in two organizations.},

We were particularly interested in up-and-coming and outdated topics and whether the views of academics and industry researchers differ. Also, we compared the views of the community with the results of an earlier literature survey published at SPLC 2018. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey with attendees of SPLC 2018. We received 33 responses (about a third of the attendees) from both, very experienced attendees and younger researchers, and from academics as well as industry researchers. We report preliminary findings regarding popular and unpopular SPL topics, topics requiring further work, and industry versus academic researchers' views. Differences between academic and industry researchers become visible only when analyzing comments on open questions. Most importantly, while topics popular among respondents are also popular in the literature, topics respondents think require further work have often already been well researched. We conclude that the SPL community needs to do a better job preserving and communicating existing knowledge and particularly also needs to widen its scope.},

abstract = {The importance of experimentation for Software Engineering research has been notably established in the last years. The software engineering community has discussed how to proper report and evaluate experiments using different approaches, such as quality criteria, scales, and checklists. Nevertheless, there are no guidelines to support researchers and practitioners active in straightforward software engineering research areas, as in Software Product Lines (SPL), at conducting experiments. We hypothesize that experimentation guidelines may aid such a specific area by providing advice and actual excerpts reflecting good practices of SPL experimentation, thus experimentally evolving this area. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to provide guidelines for properly reporting and promoting SPL experiments. We defined such guidelines based on well-known software engineering experiment reports, quality evaluation checklists, and data extracted from 211 SPL experiments identified in a systematic mapping study. We evaluated the guidelines with a qualitative study with SPL and experimentation experts applying open and axial coding procedures. The evaluation enabled us to improve the guidelines. The resulting guidelines contain specific advice to researchers active in SPL and provide examples taken from published SPL experiments. The experts’ positive points indicate that the proposed guidelines can aid SPL researchers and practitioners. Sharing the resulting guidelines could support conducting SPL experiments and allow further area evolution based on prospective experiment replications and reproductions from well-designed and reported experiments.},

abstract = {The concept of value can be formalized as the ratio of benefits to costs. The value is realized if total benefits outweigh total costs, while value-adding consists of delivering higher benefit at lower cost. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) has shown its power to bring benefits and reduce costs for practitioners in various domains, however, systematic value-adding analysis is rare and adding value through SPLE is a dynamic process. FISCAN, a leading manufacturer of security inspection systems in China, continues to explore the value-adding process through SPLE during the evolution of its software product lines in the security inspection domain. This paper discusses the value-adding effect of the "invisible hand" of the market. We identify economic, technical and organizational factors for value-adding through SPLE based on the SPLE practices at FISCAN. We describe the influence of the FISCAN product lines on FISCAN itself, the market and other stakeholders, and suggest what the future may bring in value-adding through SPLE.},

abstract = {We define a family of FQAs ready to be reused in many software architectures.We define an Aspect-Oriented SPL to inject customized FQAs into the applications.Two different implementations of the SPL are provided and compared.Modelling FQAs separately from the applications increases reusability.The final architectures exhibit a high degree of separation of concerns. Some quality attributes can be modelled using software components, and are normally known as Functional Quality Attributes (FQAs). Applications may require different FQAs, and each FQA (e.g., security) can be composed of many concerns (e.g., access control or authentication). They normally have dependencies between them and crosscut the system architecture. The goal of the work presented here is to provide the means for software architects to focus only on application functionality, without having to worry about FQAs. The idea is to model FQAs separately from application functionality following a Software Product Line (SPL) approach. By combining SPL and aspect-oriented mechanisms, we will define a generic process to model and automatically inject FQAs into the application without breaking the base architecture. We will provide and compare two implementations of our generic approach using different variability and architecture description languages: (i) feature models and an aspect-oriented architecture description language; and (ii) the Common Variability Language (CVL) and a MOF-compliant language (e.g., UML). We also discuss the benefits and limitations of our approach. Modelling FQAs separately from the base application has many advantages (e.g., reusability, less coupled components, high cohesive architectures).},

In the FSW domain, there exists a significant amount of variability in the required capabilities. For example, some FSW have a significant amount of hardware to control and operate in a nearly autonomous fashion. In contrast, other FSW have a small amount of hardware to control and rely heavily of commanding from the ground station to operate the spacecraft. The underlying architecture and component interactions needed for the different FSWs are quite different. This amount of architectural variability makes it difficult to develop a SPL architecture that covers the all possible variability in the FSW domain. Therefore, this paper presents a practical solution to this real world problem that leverages software product line concepts and software architectural design patterns.},

abstract = {Product Line Engineering is an approach to reuse assets of complex systems by taking advantage of commonalities between product families. Reuse within complex systems usually means reuse of artifacts from different engineering domains such as mechanical, electronics and software engineering. Model-based systems engineering is becoming a standard for systems engineering and collaboration within different domains. This paper presents an exploratory case study on initial efforts of adopting Product Line Engineering practices within the model-based systems engineering process at Volvo Construction Equipment (Volvo CE), Sweden. We have used SysML to create overloaded models of the engine systems at Volvo CE. The variability within the engine systems was captured by using the Orthogonal Variability Modeling language. The case study has shown us that overloaded SysML models tend to become complex even on small scale systems, which in turn makes scalability of the approach a major challenge. For successful reuse and to, possibly, tackle scalability, it is necessary to have a database of reusable assets from which product variants can be derived.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL), a family-based software development process, has proven to be a more effective technology than single software systems. Testing SPL products individually is redundant for product lines testing. Meanwhile, the complexity of systematically testing SPL programs is combinatorial, which limits the scalability of testing SPL.In this paper, I will introduce the idea of accelerating SPL testing by dynamic analysis. I intend to investigate a dynamic analysis of SPL testing, which analyzes all variants during the execution of a SPL, and forks the execution only a variant leads to a different state. In addition, to get the preliminary result, we can encode a family of variants into a single program to simulate a realization of SPL testing. The experimental result collected on the mutated C program, printtokens in Software-artifact Infrastructure Repository, shows our approach can accelerate the SPL testing with a speedup up to 4.83X than testing each variants at a time and pruning 87% of the variants.},

However, in most cases, the focus of those requirements is limited to the functional requirements. The non-functional requirements are often informally defined and their management does not provide traceability mechanisms for their validation. In this paper, we present a multimodel approach that allows the explicit representation of non-functional requirements for software product lines both at domain engineering, and application engineering levels. The multimodel allows the representation of different viewpoints of a software product line, including the non-functional requirements and the relationships that these non-functional requirements might have with features and functionalities. The feasibility of this approach is illustrated through a specific example from the automotive domain.},

abstract = {Supercomputing centers, typically non-profit, government or university-based organizations with scarce resources, are increasingly being requested to provide customized web portals for user-centered access to their services in order to support a demanding customer base. These portals often have very similar architectures and meet similar requirements, with the variations primarily being in the specialized analysis applications, and in the input and output of these applications. Given these characteristics, Software Production Line Engineering (SPLE) approaches will be valuable in enabling development teams to cost-effectively meet demands. In this paper, we demonstrate a suite of web portals developed at The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) by applying SPLE methodologies. We show how we applied feature modeling on these applications to identify commonalities in their application level features despite differences in their problem domains. We describe a common framework (we term it Per User DrupaL, or PUDL), which serves as the common foundation for these portals. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPLE in terms of reduced development time and effort, and discuss the technical challenges faced in this process. Finally we propose, as an extension to our work, an automation framework for portal generation, which users could build their own customized portals.},

Products within an SPL vary from each other in terms of which features they include. Applying existing analysis techniques to SPLs and their safety cases is usually challenging because of the potentially exponential number of products with respect to the number of supported features. In this paper, we present a methodology and infrastructure for certified lifting of existing single-product safety analyses to product lines. To ensure certified safety of our infrastructure, we implement it in an interactive theorem prover, including formal definitions, lemmas, correctness criteria theorems, and proofs.We apply this infrastructure to formalize and lift a Change Impact Assessment (CIA) algorithm. We present a formal definition of the lifted algorithm, outline its correctness proof (with the full machine-checked proof available online), and discuss its implementation within a model management framework.},

Some of the potential benefits of this approach include cost reduction, improvements in product quality and a decrease in product development time. The increasing popularity of software product line engineering in the software industry necessitates a process maturity evaluation methodology. Accordingly, this paper presents an organizational maturity model of software product line engineering for evaluating the maturity of organizational dimension. The model assumes that organizational theories, behavior, and management play a critical role in the institutionalization of software product line engineering within an organization. Assessment questionnaires and a rating methodology comprise the framework of this model. The objective and design of the questionnaires are to collect information about the software product line engineering process from the dual perspectives of organizational behavior and management. Furthermore, we conducted two case studies and reported the assessment results using the organizational maturity model presented in this paper.},

abstract = {Automotive manufacturing ranks among the most extreme instances of systems and software product line engineering (PLE). The product family numbers in the millions, each product is highly complex in its own right, and the variation across products is literally astronomical in scale. This paper explores the aspects that make the domain extreme and the very specific implications they have for PLE. These implications include the need for efficient manufacturing, complexity management, concurrent development streams, globally distributed engineering and production, a hierarchical product family tree, multi-level variation binding, constraint management, and a highly robust and integrated PLE tooling environment. Happily, the PLE paradigm supporting these implications brings about a number of opportunities for analysis and automation that provide efficiencies of production previously unattainable. We focus on one example in depth: The management and automated generation of the many thousands of calibration parameters that determine vehicle-specific software behavior. Throughout, we use the vehicle product line at General Motors, which we believe to be the world's largest, to illustrate and ground our journey through automotive PLE.},

abstract = {The extractive adoption of Software Product Lines (SPL) relies on the reuse of the already developed systems, employing a reengineering process. However, due to the diversity of options found in the daily practice of SPL development, rigorous planning of scenarios is critical to perform SPL reengineering. This diversity is the result of different organizational aspects, such as team experience and product portfolio. Hence, a proper planning process must consider technical and organizational aspects, however, most existing studies in the field do not take into account organizational aspects of the companies. In this work, we present SPLReePlan, an automated framework to aid the SPL reengineering planning taking into account technical and organizational aspects. Our framework is supported by a web-based tool, ready to be used in the industry. To investigate how flexible is SPLReePlan to support the SPL reengineering planning in diverse situations, we extracted eight different scenarios from the SPL literature, which are used as input for the evaluation of SPLReePlan. The results indicate that SPLReePlan can be satisfactorily customized to a variety of scenarios with different artifacts, feature retrieval techniques, and reengineering activities. As a contribution, we discuss the lessons learned within the evaluation, and present challenges that were faced, being a source of information for tool builders or motivating new studies.},

abstract = {A number of product-line analysis approaches lift analyses such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving from the level of single programs to the level of product lines. These approaches share concepts and mechanisms that suggest an unexplored potential for reuse of key analysis steps and properties, implementation, and verification efforts. Despite the availability of taxonomies synthesizing such approaches, there still remains the underlying problem of not being able to describe product-line analyses and their properties precisely and uniformly. We propose a formal framework that models product-line analyses in a compositional manner, providing an overall understanding of the space of family-based, feature-based, and product-based analysis strategies. It defines precisely how the different types of product-line analyses compose and inter-relate. To ensure soundness, we formalize the framework, providing mechanized specification and proofs of key concepts and properties of the individual analyses. The formalization provides unambiguous definitions of domain terminology and assumptions as well as solid evidence of key properties based on rigorous formal proofs. To qualitatively assess the generality of the framework, we discuss to what extent it describes five representative product-line analyses targeting the following properties: safety, performance, dataflow facts, security, and functional program properties.},

The correct identification of similarities between different products can be a time-intensive task. Hence, this paper proposes an automated semantical similarity analysis supporting software product line extraction and maintenance. Under the assumption of an already identified compatible interface, the degree of semantical similarity is identified based on provided test cases. Therefore, the analysis can also be applied in a test-driven development. This is done by translating available test sequences for both components into two I/O extended finite automata and performing an abstraction of the defined behavior until a simulation relation is established. The test-based approach avoids complexity issues regarding the state space explosion problem, a common issue in model checking. The proposed approach is applied on different variants and versions of industrially used software components provided by an automotive supplier to demonstrate the method's applicability.},

abstract = {Reverse engineering is the information extraction process on system by identifying and analyzing the components that are part of that system. We analyze existing research that related with reverse engineering process on software product line. There are two product line processes according to Software product line engineering framework they are domain engineering process and application engineering process. We investigate reverse engineering in domain engineering process (domain requirements, domain design, and domain realization, domain quality assurance). We performed a systematic literature review. A manual search resulting 71 papers considered for analysis. Results: The majority of reverse engineering studied in three domain activity in domain engineering process. That is requirement engineering, domain design and domain realization. There are inconsistent correlations between features in the reverse engineering process. These approaches extract features without constraints between its features. Conclusions: Reverse engineering methods are needed that are able to identify and maintain a consistent correlation between features in application engineering and domain engineering in the reverse engineering process. Finally, we provide gaps from existing research and show opportunities for future research.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) is a software development approach that systematically applies reuse of artifacts in a specific domain. In the last years, the industry has increasingly required the support of tools for most SPL life cycle activities, targeting feature models and related diagrams, variability management and SPL specific products configuration. However, existing literature does not present any tools with native support to UML-based SPLs. In addition, relying on manipulating XMI files for general-purpose UML tools for such SPLs takes significant effort, and it is time-consuming and error-prone. In this scenario, we developed SMartyModeling, with support to UML stereotype-based variability management. To evolve our tool, we evaluated it throughout a survey answered by 37 participants. We adopted questions from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the System Usability Scale (SUS). We organized it into three sections of Likert-scaled questions for usefulness, ease of use, and usability. A last section consisted of open questions focused on positive and negative aspects and an overview of the evalaution. SMartyModeling was well evaluated in relation to usefulness, ease of use, and usability. We analyzed and interpreted the respondents quotes using correlation techniques and open and axial coding. The analysis of open questions allowed us a direct identification of points to improve the tool, its limitations and positive aspects.},

Employing Product Line Engineering (PLE) is believed to bring potential benefits with respect to reduced cost, higher productivity, higher quality, and faster time-to-market. However, relatively few industrial field studies are reported regarding the application of PLE to develop large-scale systems, and more specifically CPSs. In this paper, we report about our experiences and insights gained from investigating the application of model-based PLE at a large international organization developing subsea production systems (typical CPSs) to manage the exploitation of oil and gas production fields. We report in this paper 1) how two systematic domain analyses (on requirements engineering and product configuration/derivation) were conducted to elicit CPS PLE requirements and challenges, 2) key results of the domain analysis (commonly observed in other domains), and 3) our initial experience of developing and applying two Model Based System Engineering (MBSE) PLE solution to address some of the requirements and challenges elicited during the domain analyses.},

abstract = {Software and systems product line engineering (PLE) has been an established approach for reducing time to market as well as cost and increasing quality in a set of related products for two decades now. Although there is a huge body of knowledge on PLE, adopting a concrete PLE approach is still not a trivial endeavor for interested companies. With the increasing importance of development speed, the advent of agile engineering approaches, and decreasing management interest in improvements that require large organizational transformations and only show benefits after several years, companies are facing challenges in successfully adopting this approach. They often hesitate as there is no clear adoption path, nor any certainty, that the intended improvement steps will also provide added value in the short- and mid-term perspective. In consequence, a considerable amount of PLE potential still remains unexploited.To help such companies with the adoption of PLE, the goal of this paper is to provide inspiration and evidence that PLE is a sound approach and its successful introduction is possible even in settings that differ substantially from those of pioneer product lines.To this end, this paper presents the following main contributions with the PLE adoption case at Danfoss Drives: an overview of the key change drivers and the motivation for adopting a PLE approach, a discussion of incremental PLE introduction in an agile engineering context, a presentation of the current PLE setting with a focus on key concepts, and finally a presentation of motivators and directions for future improvements.},

Dealing with them is not well established yet, neither in theory nor in practice. In this sense, we present a framework to specify NFP for SPLE and we also propose a reuse approach that promotes the reuse of NFP values during the product configuration.

When there is the need of evolving the Software Product Line (SPL) to include new features, or move to a new platform, a degraded PLA requires considerable effort to understand and modify, demanding expensive refactoring activity. In the state of the art, search-based algorithms are used to improve PLA at package level. However, recent studies have shown that the most variability and implementation details of an SPL are described in the level of classes. There is a gap between existing approaches and existing practical needs. In this work, we extend the current state of the art to deal with feature modularization in the level of classes by introducing a new search operator and a set of objective functions to deal with feature modularization in a finer granularity of the architectural elements, namely at class level. We evaluated the proposal in an exploratory study with a PLA widely investigated and a real-world PLA. The results of quantitative and qualitative analysis point out that our proposal provides solutions to properly re-modularize features in a PLA, being preferred by practitioners, in order to support the evolution of SPLs.},

Numerous case stu-dies in industrial and military domains have shown that reliability, quality, productivity and user interface consistency improve drasti-cally in addition to the decrease of cost and time-to-market. Also, this system engineering approach is very effective in three market strategies known as cost leadership, differentiation, and focusing.

While this paradigm has been successfully applied for the development of embedded systems in various domains, new challenges have emerged from the development of safety critical systems that require certification against a specific standard. Existing SPLE approaches do not explicitly consider the various certification standards or levels that products should satisfy. In this paper, we focus on several practical issues involved in the SPLE process, establishing an infrastructure of a product line engineering for certified products. A metamodel is proposed to capture the entities involved in SPL certification and the relationships among them. ProLiCES, which is a model-driven process for the development of SPLs, was modified to serve as an example of our approach, in the context of the UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) domain.},

This article proposes a portfolio-driven development method and its management method of APLE (Agile Product Line Engineering). The proposed method is intended to manage agile evolution of multiple product lines while increasing variability of products. To establish a portfolio management of development resources, it is necessary for an organization to manage multiple product lines on APLE in an entire development. We propose a portfolio-driven development method of three layers on APLE and its management method based on a concept of portfolio management life cycle. We applied the proposed management model and method to the multiple product lines of automotive software systems, and demonstrated an improvement of manageability with better predictability of both productivity and development size. This article contributes to provide an entire development management method for APLE, and its practical experience in the automotive multiple product lines.},

We assessed the research type of the papers (academic or industry), the kind of evaluation (application example, empirical, etc.), and the application domain. Also, we assessed which product line life-cycle phases, development practices, and topics the papers address. We present an analysis of the topics covered by academic vs. industry research and discuss the evolution of these topics and their relation over the years.

These systems perform safety critical functions and must conform to national safety institutions and international regulations. In many cases, regulatory documents provide very high level and ambiguous requirements that leave a large margin for interpretation. As the French nuclear industry is now seeking to spread its activities outside France, it is but necessary to master the ins and the outs of the variability between countries safety culture and regulations. This sets both an industrial and a scientific challenge to introduce and propose a product line engineering approach to an unaware industry whose safety culture is made of interpretations, specificities, and exceptions.This paper presents our current work within the French R&amp;D project CONNEXION, while introducing variability modeling to the French nuclear industry. In particular, we discuss the background, the quest for the best variability paradigm, the practical modeling of requirements variability as well as the mapping between variable requirements and variable architecture elements.},

In this paper, we contribute the Collaboration and Source Code Driven Bottom-up approach, with two main enhancements. We apply clone detection and architecture reengineering techniques for identifying variability from the legacy artifacts. These techniques which have been traditionally used for maintaining software are now used for identifying variability and analyze code coupling and cohesion from the legacy code. Our second enhancement is improving stakeholder collaboration by guiding the domain experts in order to decide on variability. In particular, we apply Questions, Options and Criteria technique for capturing rationale and supporting collaboration.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a set of industrial software-intensive systems for configuring similar software products in which personalized feature sets are configured by different business teams. The integration of these feature sets can generate inconsistencies that are typically resolved through manual deliberation. This is a time-consuming process and leads to a potential loss of business resources. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can provide the best solution to address this issue autonomously through more efficient configurations, lesser inconsistencies and optimized resources. This paper presents the first literature review of both research and industrial AI applications to SPL configuration issues. Our results reveal only 19 relevant research works which employ traditional AI techniques on small feature sets with no real-life testing or application in industry. We categorize these works in a typology by identifying 8 perspectives of SPL. We also show that only 2 standard industrial SPL tools employ AI in a limited way to resolve inconsistencies. To inject more interest and application in this domain, we motivate and present future research directions. Particularly, using real-world SPL data, we demonstrate how predictive analytics (a state of the art AI technique) can separately model inconsistent and consistent patterns, and then predict inconsistencies in advance to help SPL designers during the configuration of a product. Literature review of AI applications to SPL configuration issuesDevelop a taxonomy based on eight different problem domainsThis review shows use of logic, constraint satisfaction, reasoning, ontology and optimization.Several important future research directions are proposed.We justify advanced analytics and swarm intelligence as better future applications.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is a compelling methodology that accomplishes systematic reuse in families of systems by relying on two key principles: (i) the decomposition of complex systems into composable and reusable building blocks (often logical units called features), and (ii) on-demand construction of products and product variants by composing these building blocks.However, unless the stakeholder responsible for product configuration has detailed knowledge of the technical ins and outs of the software product line (e.g., the architectural impact of a specific feature, or potential feature interactions), he is in many cases flying in the dark. Although many initial approaches and techniques have been proposed that take into account quality considerations and involve trade-off decisions during product configuration, no systematic support exists.In this paper, we present a reference architecture for product configuration tooling, providing support for (i) up-front generation of variants, and (ii) quality analysis of these variants. This allows pro-actively assessing and predicting architectural quality properties for each product variant and in turn, product configuration tools can take into account architectural considerations. In addition, we provide an in-depth discussion of techniques and tactics for dealing with the problem of variant explosion, and as such to maintain practical feasibility of such approaches.We validated and implemented our reference architecture in the context of a real-world industrial application, a product-line for the firmware of an automotive sensor. Our prototype, based on FeatureIDE, is open for extension and readily available.},

abstract = {It is not unusual for commercial product line organizations to manufacture millions of product instances every year, in thousands of different "flavors". The scale and scope of diversity in product lines of this size can be high, creating significant challenges to engineers implementing the product line, product marketers defining the space of available products, and customers selecting from available products. Companies often organize their products into a product family tree to provide clarity about their product groupings and offerings, better enabling their customers to effectively navigate among the huge number of offerings and to efficiently converge on a suitable product instance. This paper describes a 2nd Generation Product Line Engineering (2GPLE) feature modeling structure called a multistage configuration tree that supports the engineering, deployment and maintenance of complex product family trees. Feature selections and downselections are incrementally staged throughout the nodes in a product family tree. Feature decisions made at any node are inherited by all descendants of that node, thereby defining a product family subtree.},

The analysing progression facilitates us to guarantee the quality of overall design. By doing so there were many limitations that lead to critical situations in the development process. This work proposes to collect all the stakeholders' decisions in a single structural view, which expose the centric-view decision in an architectural design. It also used to deal with the disagreement in vision by examining it, with the premium software quality characteristic. The quality attributes are evaluated by association rules to improve the excellence of the software design. Association rules are implemented using R tool to get the support, confidence, lift and count values of each attribute along with its metric. The best quality attributes are chosen after managing the stakeholders' conflicts, since all the systems are designed due to the stakeholders' concerns. The best design patterns can be evaluated along with the distinguished attributes. These patterns are evaluated by fixing the basic principles of patterns based on their excellence.},

abstract = {The scale and complexity of product lines means that it is practically infeasible to develop a single model of the entire system, regardless of the languages or notations used. The dynamic nature of real-world systems means that product line models need to evolve continuously to meet new customer requirements and to reflect changes of product line artifacts. To address these challenges, product line engineers need to apply different strategies for structuring the modeling space to ease the creation and maintenance of models. This paper presents an approach that aims at reducing the maintenance effort by organizing product lines as a set of interrelated model fragments defining the variability of particular parts of the system. We provide support to semi-automatically merge fragments into complete product line models. We also provide support to automatically detect inconsistencies between product line artifacts and the models representing these artifacts after changes. Furthermore, our approach supports the co-evolution of models and their respective meta-models. We discuss strategies for structuring the modeling space and show the usefulness of our approach using real-world examples from our ongoing industry collaboration.},

For the overall optimisation of modular product family with bi-level relationship, the upper-level module is to reflect the universality and adaptability of the product, and the lower-level module is more to meet the customisation needs of customers.

abstract = {Testing software product lines (SPLs) is very challenging due to a high degree of variability leading to an enormous number of possible products. The vast majority of today's testing approaches for SPLs validate products individually using different kinds of reuse techniques for testing. Because of their reusability and adaptability capabilities, model-based approaches are suitable to describe variability and are therefore frequently used for implementation and testing purposes of SPLs. Due to the enormous number of possible products, individual product testing becomes more and more infeasible. Pairwise testing offers one possibility to test a subset of all possible products. However, according to the best of our knowledge, there is no contribution discussing and rating this approach in the SPL context. In this contribution, we provide a mapping between feature models describing the common and variable parts of an SPL and a reusable test model in the form of statecharts. Thereby, we interrelate feature model-based coverage criteria and test model-based coverage criteria such as control and data flow coverage and are therefore able to discuss the potentials and limitations of pairwise testing. We pay particular attention to test requirements for feature interactions constituting a major challenge in SPL engineering. We give a concise definition of feature dependencies and feature interactions from a testing point of view, and we discuss adequacy criteria for SPL coverage under pairwise feature interaction testing and give a generalization to the T-wise case. The concept and implementation of our approach are evaluated by means of a case study from the automotive domain.},

As a consequence of this division, tests should be performed in both processes. However, existing testing techniques for single systems cannot be applied during domain engineering, because of the variability in the domain artifacts. Existing software product line test techniques only cover unit and system tests. Our contribution is a model-based, automated integration test technique that can be applied during domain engineering. For generating integration test case scenarios, the technique abstracts from variability and assumes that placeholders are created for variability. The generated scenarios cover all interactions between the integrated components, which are specified in a test model. Additionally, the technique reduces the effort for creating placeholders by minimizing the number of placeholders needed to execute the integration test case scenarios. We have experimentally measured the performance of the technique and the potential reduction of placeholders.},

Pareto-optimal variants, with respect to a set of objectives such as minimizing a variant's cost while maximizing battery life and security, are variants in which no single quality can be improved without sacrificing other qualities. We propose a novel method and a tool for visualization and exploration of a multi-dimensional space of optimal variants (i.e., a Pareto front). The visualization method is an integrated, interactive, and synchronized set of complementary views onto a Pareto front specifically designed to support PLE scenarios, including: understanding differences among variants and their positioning with respect to quality dimensions; solving trade-offs; selecting the most desirable variants; and understanding the impact of changes during product line evolution on a variant's qualities. We present an initial experimental evaluation showing that the visualization method is a good basis for supporting these PLE scenarios.},

The mCRL2 data language allows to smoothly deal with feature sets and attributes, its process language is sufficiently rich to model feature selection, as well as product behavior based on an FTS-like semantics. Because of the feature-orientation, our modeling strategy allows a natural refactoring of the semantic model of a product family into a parallel composition of components that reflects coherent sets of features. This opens the way for dedicated abstraction and reduction techniques that strengthen the prospect of a scalable verification approach to software product lines. In this paper, we sketch how to model product families in mCRL2 and how to apply a modular verification method, preparing the ground to further assess the scalability of our approach, in particular regarding model checking.},

Within this paper, we describe this case study of migrating cloned variants to a software product line based on the extractive approach.

Currently, we support monitoring hardware from three different companies that use the same core system and provide a configurable front-end. We share our experiences and encountered problems with cloning and migration towards a software product line---focusing on feature extraction and modeling in particular.

Combinatorial interaction testing is a technique to reduce the number of products under test. However, it is typically up-to the tester in which order these products are tested. We propose a similarity-based prioritization to be applied on these products before they are generated. The proposed approach does not guarantee to find more errors than sampling approaches, but it aims at increasing interaction coverage of an SPL under test as fast as possible over time. This is especially beneficial since usually the time budget for testing is limited. We implemented similarity-based prioritization in FeatureIDE and evaluated it by comparing its outcome to the default outcome of three sampling algorithms as well as to random orders. The experiment results indicate that the order with similarity-based prioritization is better than random orders and often better than the default order of existing sampling algorithms.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineering is increasingly being adopted in safety-critical systems. It is highly desirable to rigorously show that these systems are designed correctly. However, formal analysis for SPLs is more difficult than for single systems because an SPL may contain a large number of individual systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient model-checking technique for SPLs using induction and a SAT (Boolean satisfiability problem) solver. We show how an induction-based verification method can be adapted to the SPLs, with the help of a SAT solver. To combat the state space explosion problem, a novel technique that exploits the distinguishing characteristics of SPLs, called feature cube enlargement, is proposed to reduce the verification efforts. The incremental SAT mechanism is applied to further improve the efficiency. The correctness of our technique is proved. Experimental results show dramatic improvement of our technique over the existing binary decision diagram (BDD)-based techniques.},

abstract = {Product configuration based on a feature model in software product lines is the process of selecting the desired features based on customers’ requirements. In most cases, application engineers focus on the functionalities of the target product during product configuration process whereas the quality attributes are handled until the final product is produced. However, it is costly to fix the problem if the quality attributes have not been considered in the product configuration stage. The key issue of assessing a quality attribute of a product configuration is to measure the impact on a quality attribute made by the set of functional variable features selected in a configuration. Current existing approaches have several limitations, such as no quantitative measurements provided or requiring existing valid products and heavy human effort for the assessment. To overcome theses limitations, we propose an Analytic Hierarchical Process (AHP) based approach to estimate the relative importance of each functional variable feature on a quality attribute. Based on the relative importance value of each functional variable feature on a quality attribute, the level of quality attributes of a product configuration in software product lines can be assessed. An illustrative example based on the Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) software product line is presented to demonstrate how the proposed approach works.},

abstract = {Increased demand for a greater variety of products has forced many companies to rethink their strategies to offer more product variants without sacrificing production efficiency. In this context, research has found that such a trade-off can be properly managed by exploiting the module-based product family (MBPF) design. Over the years, active work in developing methods to design MBPFs has been carried out. Nevertheless, many of them have been created, and consequently exist, in isolation from one other. As a result, the adoption of these methods in industry and academy alike is inhibited by the seemingly broad array of material without a coherent organizing structure. To bridge this gap, this paper performs a systematic literature review and a meta-synthesis, wherein 72 methods to design MBPFs and their respective instances are connected in the form of a functional model and structured classes of design problems. These entities together serve as a meta-method for organizing the research on MBPF design, from which it was possible to identify the common underlying structure among the methods developed over the past 20&nbsp;years. The main contributions of this work include: (1) constructing a functional model that connects the design methods for MBPFs; (2) suggesting structured classes of design problems that complement the functional model by cataloging the techniques meant to execute each sub-function of the model; (3) proposing a construction heuristic to build and assess functional models and classes of design problems.},

abstract = {The process of Developing Software Product Line Architectures can be a complex task. However, the use of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques can facilitate the development of SPLAs by introducing Domain Specific Languages, Graphical Editors, and Generators. Together these are considered the sacred triad of MDE. Key to understanding MDE and how it fits into SPLAs is to know exactly what each part of the trinity means, how it relates to the other parts, and what the various implementations are for each. This tutorial will demonstrate the use of the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and Eclipse's Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) to create an actual MDE solution as applied to a sample SPLA. These tools collectively form what is called a Language Workbench. During this tutorial we will also illustrate how to model the visual artifacts of our Domain Model and generate a Domain Specific Graphical Editor using GMF.This tutorial has its foundations in years of industrial experience with large and complex SPLAs in various industries. This tutorial continues to be updated each year to include recent and critical innovations in MDE and SPL. This year will include information on key Model Transformation, Constraints and Textual Modeling Languages targeted at Software Product Lines. Additionally, it will cover advances in Software Product Line migration technologies which include techniques as to how to effectively migrate legacy systems toward and MDE/SPLA architecture and implementation. This year's tutorial includes extensive industrial experience on the testing of large and complex SPLAs.The goal of this tutorial is to educate attendees on what MDE technologies are, how exactly they relate synergistically to Software Product Line Architectures, and how to actually apply them using an existing Eclipse implementation.The benefits of the technology are so far reaching that we feel the intended audience spans technical managers, developers and CTOs. In general the target audience includes researchers and practitioners who are working on problems related to the design and implementation of SPLAs and would like to understand the benefits of applying MDE techniques towards SPLAs and leverage Eclipse as a framework to develop MDE solutions. The first half will be less technical than the second half where we cover the details of SPLA and MDE in action in complete detail showing patterns and code.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is an emerging methodology for the development of variant-rich software systems. As software product lines are viable for this purpose, testing them is complicated in contrast to non-variable systems, as there is an increasingly amount of possible products due to the number of features. There exist many methods proposed for testing software product lines, but seldom the quality of the resulting tests was assessed. For assessing test quality mutation analysis is a well-known technique and is frequently applied to non-variable software systems. However, mutation analysis cannot be applied straight-forward onto software product lines.We present a mutation system for assessing the quality of software product line tests by means of fault detection capability. Our mutation system comprises model-based mutation operators, test case adaption, automated model and test execution, and automated mutation analysis. So far, we developed several mutation operators for feature models, UML state machines, and mapping models. We evaluated the mutation operators against tests that were generated from the specifications and applied them for three case studies. From the results we draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the individual mutation operators.},

abstract = {Live Training Transformation (LT2) is the product line strategy put in place by the United States Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI). The purpose of the LT2 product line is to provide a common set of core assets including architectures, software components, standards and processes that form the basis of all Army Live Training systems. As products consuming LT2 core assets evolve to meet the latest requirements of the military live training community, changes to the core product line architecture must also be made. Based on thorough analysis of the LT2 core capabilities and user trends toward web-enabled and mobile computing technologies, a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) strategy was identified and adopted as the objective architecture for the evolving LT2 product line. Future success of the LT2 product line now depends on the alignment of product line engineering concepts with the business and technical benefits of SOA, and to ensure that systematic reuse continues to provide substantial return-on-investment for the Army. This paper addresses the challenges of adopting SOA into an existing software product line, the unique circumstances of the LT2 SOA environment, and present a set of analysis and design considerations for the product line engineering community.},

A learner focuses on training through the accessibility at all times, the quality of content, and the particularity and difference of the scenarios. The valorization of the use of Mobile Serious Games (MSG) requires the adoption of an approach. We have started our study by detecting the characteristics influencing the attachment of a learner, thereafter, we have studied the advantages of mobility in our connected society, then, we have explored the Software Product Line (SPL) modeling approach that presents the most appropriate solution to solve our problematic. Finally, we have treated the notion of variability. This concept allows the detection of common and variable points between the products of the set.

This paper presents MOA4PLA, a search-based approach to support the PLA design. It gives a multi-objective treatment to the design problem based on specific PLA metrics. A metamodel to represent the PLA and a novel search operator to improve feature modularization are proposed. Results point out that the application of MOA4PLA leads to PLA designs with well modularized features, contributing to improve features reusability and extensibility. It raises a set of solutions with different design trade-offs that can be used to improve the PLA design.},

abstract = {Background: Software product line (SPL) scoping is an important phase when planning for product line adoption. An SPL scope specifies: (1) the extent of the domain supported by the product line, (2) portfolio of products in the product line and (3) list of assets to be developed for reuse across the family of products.Issue: SPL scope planning is usually based on estimates about the state of the market and the engineering capabilities of the development team. One challenge with these estimates is that there are inaccuracies due to uncertainty in the environment or accuracy of measurement. This may result in issues ranging from suboptimal plans to infeasible plans.Objective: To address the above, we propose to include uncertainty as part of the SPL scoping model. Plans developed in consideration of uncertainty would be more robust against possible fluctuations in estimates.Approach: In this paper, a method to incorporate uncertainty in scoping optimization and its application to generate robust solutions is proposed. We capture uncertainty as part of the formulation and model scoping optimization as a multi-objective problem with profit and stability as fitness functions. Profit stability and feasibility stability are considered to represent stability concerns.Results: Results show that, compared to other scope optimization approaches, both performance stability and feasibility stability are improved while maintaining near optimal performance for profit objective. Also, generated results consist of solutions with trade-offs between profit and stability, providing the decision maker with enhanced decision support.Conclusion: Multi-objective optimization with stability consideration for SPL scoping provides project managers with a robust and flexible way to address uncertainty in the process of SPL scoping. HighlightsA robust multi-objective optimization approach for SPL scoping is proposed.Two types of stability are considered: performance stability and feasibility stability.Approach was able to find plans with higher stability.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) deals with developing artifacts that capture the common and variable aspects of software product families. Domain models are one kind of such artifacts. Being developed in early stages, domain models need to specify commonality and variability and guide the reuse of the artifacts in particular software products. Although different modeling methods have been proposed to manage and support these activities, the assessment of these methods is still in an inceptive stage. In this work, we examined the comprehensibility of domain models specified in ADOM, a UML-based SPLE method. In particular, we conducted a controlled experiment in which 116 undergraduate students were required to answer comprehension questions regarding a domain model that was equipped with explicit reuse guidance and/or variability specification. We found that explicit specification of reuse guidance within the domain model helped understand the model, whereas explicit specification of variability increased comprehensibility only to a limited extent. Explicit specification of both reuse guidance and variability often provided intermediate results, namely, results that were better than specification of variability without reuse guidance, but worse than specification of reuse guidance without variability. All these results were perceived in different UML diagram types, namely, use case, class, and sequence diagrams and for different commonality-, variability-, and reuse-related aspects.},

abstract = {Mass customization of standardized products has become a trend to succeed in today's market environment. Software Product Lines (SPLs) address this trend by describing a family of software products that share a common set of features. However, choosing the appropriate set of features that matches a user's individual interests is hampered due to the overwhelming amount of possible SPL configurations. Recommender systems can address this challenge by filtering the number of configurations and suggesting a suitable set of features for the user's requirements. In this paper, we propose a context-aware recommender system for predicting feature selections in an extended SPL configuration scenario, i.e. taking nonfunctional properties of features into consideration. We present an empirical evaluation based on a large real-world dataset of configurations derived from industrial experience in the Enterprise Resource Planning domain. Our results indicate significant improvements in the predictive accuracy of our context-aware recommendation approach over a state-of-the-art binary-based approach.},

The functional requirements of the target product can be satisfied by including the proper functional features. However, there is no such a straightforward way to realize the non-functional requirements and quality attributes of the target product. In our early work, we have developed a quantitative based method to assess the quality attributes for a configured product. However, this approach cannot adequately represent the inter-relationships among quality attributes which play an important role in product configuration process. We supplement our previous work by introducing a quality attribute knowledge base (QA_KB) to represent the inter-relationships among different quality attributes in a SPL. Furthermore, we develop algorithms for configuring a product based on customers' quality requirements. We also use a case study to illustrate our approach.},

abstract = {The software system controlling a train is typically deployed on various hardware architectures and must process various signals across those deployments. The increase of such customization scenarios and the needed adherence of the software to various safety standards in different application domains has led to the adoption of product line engineering within the railway domain. This paper explores the current state-of-practice of software product line development within a team developing industrial embedded software for a train propulsion control system. Evidence is collected using a focus group session with several engineers and through inspection of archival data. We report several benefits and challenges experienced during product line adoption and deployment. Furthermore, we identify and discuss improvement opportunities, focusing mainly on product line evolution and test automation.},

abstract = {Safety and security are important properties of any software system, particularly in safety-critical domains, such as embedded, automotive, or cyber-physical systems. Moreover, particularly those domains also employ highly-configurable systems to customize variants, for example, to different customer requirements or regulations. Unfortunately, we are missing an overview understanding of what research has been conducted on the intersection of safety and security with configurable systems. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic mapping study based on an automated search, covering ten years (2011--2020) and 65 relevant (out of 367) publications. We classified each publication based on established security and safety concerns (e.g., CIA triad) as well as the connection to configurable systems (e.g., ensuring security of such a system). In the end, we found that considerably more research has been conducted on safety concerns, but both properties seem under-explored in the context of configurable systems. Moreover, existing research focuses on two directions: Ensuring safety and security properties in product-line engineering; and applying product-line techniques to ensure safety and security properties. Our mapping study provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art as well as open issues, helping practitioners identify existing solutions and researchers define directions for future research.},

abstract = {Software product lines (SPLs) are families of software systems sharing common assets and exhibiting variabilities specific to each product member of the family. Commonalities and variabilities are often represented as features organized in a feature model. Due to combinatorial explosion of the number of products induced by possible features combinations, exhaustive testing of SPLs is intractable. Therefore, sampling and prioritization techniques have been proposed to generate sorted lists of products based on coverage criteria or weights assigned to features. Solely based on the feature model, these techniques do not take into account behavioural usage of such products as a source of prioritization. In this paper, we assess the feasibility of integrating usage models into the testing process to derive statistical testing approaches for SPLs. Usage models are given as Markov chains, enabling prioritization of probable/rare behaviours. We used featured transition systems, compactly modelling variability and behaviour for SPLs, to determine which products are realizing prioritized behaviours. Statistical prioritization can achieve a significant reduction in the state space, and modelling efforts can be rewarded by better automation. In particular, we used MaTeLo, a statistical test cases generation suite developed at ALL4TEC. We assess feasibility criteria on two systems: Claroline, a configurable course management system, and Sferion™, an embedded system providing helicopter landing assistance.},

abstract = {Collection data structures in standard libraries of programming languages are designed to excel for the average case by carefully balancing memory footprint and runtime performance. These implicit design decisions and hard-coded trade-offs do constrain users from using an optimal variant for a given problem. Although a wide range of specialized collections is available for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), they introduce yet another dependency and complicate user adoption by requiring specific Application Program Interfaces (APIs) incompatible with the standard library.  A product line for collection data structures would relieve library designers from optimizing for the general case. Furthermore, a product line allows evolving the potentially large code base of a collection family efficiently. The challenge is to find a small core framework for collection data structures which covers all variations without exhaustively listing them, while supporting good performance at the same time.  We claim that the concept of Array Mapped Tries (AMTs) embodies a high degree of commonality in the sub-domain of immutable collection data structures. AMTs are flexible enough to cover most of the variability, while minimizing code bloat in the generator and the generated code. We implemented a Data Structure Code Generator (DSCG) that emits immutable collections based on an AMT skeleton foundation. The generated data structures outperform competitive hand-optimized implementations, and the generator still allows for customization towards specific workloads.},

In this paper, we present the outline of a Ph.D. research aimed at developing a reasoning framework to improve SPL testing practices. Based on multiple sources of evidence, the framework intends to provide testers with an automated reasoner for determining which techniques may be suitable for a given variability implementation mechanism, and how these should be employed in order to makes testing in a SPL a more effective and efficient practice.

abstract = {Test prioritization is crucial for testing products in a product line considering limited budget in terms of available time and resources. In general, it is not practically feasible to execute all the possible test cases and so, ordering test case execution permits test engineers to discover faults earlier in the testing process. An efficient prioritization of test cases for one or more products requires a clear consideration of the tradeoff among various costs (e.g., time, required resources) and effectiveness (e.g., feature coverage) objectives. As an integral part of the future Cisco's test scheduling system for validating video conferencing products, we introduce a search-based multi-objective test prioritization technique, considering multiple cost and effectiveness measures. In particular, our multi-objective optimization setup includes the minimization of execution cost (e.g., time), and the maximization of number of prioritized test cases, feature pairwise coverage and fault detection capability. Based on cost-effectiveness measures, a novel fitness function is defined for such test prioritization problem. The fitness function is empirically evaluated together with three commonly used search algorithms (e.g., (1+1) Evolutionary algorithm (EA)) and Random Search as a comparison baseline based on the Cisco's industrial case study and 500 artificial designed problems. The results show that (1+1) EA achieves the best performance for solving the test prioritization problem and it scales up to solve the problems of varying complexity.},

abstract = {The design of the product line architecture (PLA) is a difficult activity that can benefit from the application of design patterns and from the use of a search-based optimization approach, which is generally guided by different objectives related, for instance, to cohesion, coupling and PLA extensibility. The use of design patterns for PLAs is a recent research field, not completely explored yet. Some works apply the patterns manually and for a specific domain. Approaches to search-based PLA design do not consider the usage of these patterns. To allow such use, this paper introduces a mutation operator named “Pattern-Driven Mutation Operator” that includes methods to automatically identify suitable scopes and apply the patterns Strategy, Bridge and Mediator with the search-based approach multi-objective optimization approach for PLA. A metamodel is proposed to represent and identify suitable scopes to receive each one of the patterns, avoiding the introduction of architectural anomalies. Empirical results are also presented, showing evidences that the use of the proposed operator produces a greater diversity of solutions and improves the quality of the PLAs obtained in the search-based optimization process, regarding the values of software metrics.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) 1 is a very promising trend of software reusability. It could be applied in different fields in order to enhance and facilitate the software development process. In the last years, SPLs have broken into Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. An increasing need showed up for techniques, approaches and tools that combine SPL with ERP. Cloud ERP systems offer many benefits for Small and Medium Enterprises (SME). Managing the requirements elicitation process for Cloud ERP SPLs is a challenging process that faces many difficulties, such as the indirect interaction and the larger context of the target consumers. Facilitating the requirements elicitation process for cloud-based ERP SPLs by using automated tools will help to solve the faced difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, in the context of ERP SPLs, there are no tools for eliciting the requirements of cloud--based ERP SPLs nor even for ERP SPL. This paper exploits the advantages of the Form-Based Model (FBM) as a conceptual model to integrate it with cloud based ERP SPL. In addition, based on this integration, the paper presents a tool for eliciting the requirements of cloud-based ERP SPLs},

abstract = {Product family design (PFD) has been traditionally tackled as a single-level multi-objective optimization problem. This paper reveals a complex type of leader-follower joint optimization (LFJO) problems that are widely observed for PFD. Leader-follower decision making is inherent in product family optimization that involves multiple decision makers and encompasses different levels of decision hierarchy, in which many conflicting goals compete to arrive at equilibrium solutions. It is important for PFD to explicitly model such leader-follower decisions in line with a Stackelberg game. Consistent with multiple decision makers across different stages of the PFD process and multiple levels of the PFD decision hierarchy, this paper classifies the leader-follower decisions of PFD using a quartet grid, which serves as a reference model for conceptualization of diverse types of LFJO problems associated with PFD. Coinciding with the bilevel decision structure of game theoretic optimization, each LFJO problem formulation defined from the quartet grid can be quantitatively mapped to a bilevel programming mathematical model to be solved effectively by nested genetic algorithms. A case study of gear reducer PFD is presented to demonstrate the rational and potential of the LFJO quartet grid for dealing with game-theoretic optimization problems underpinning PFD decisions.},

abstract = {The selection of optimal test sets for Software Product Lines (SPLs) is a complex task impacted by many factors and that needs to consider the tester's preferences. To help in this task, Preference-based Evolutionary Multi-objective Algorithms (PEMOAs) have been explored. They use a Reference Point (RP), which represents the user preference and guides the search, resulting in a greater number of solutions in the ROI (Region of Interest). This region contains solutions that are more interesting from the tester's point of view. However, the explored PEMOAs have not been compared yet and the results reported in the literature do not consider many-objective formulations. Such an evaluation is important because in the presence of more than three objectives the performance of the algorithms may change and the number of solutions increases. Considering this fact, this work presents evaluation results of four PEMOAs for selection of products in the SPL testing considering cost, testing criteria coverage, products similarity, and the number of revealed faults, given by the mutation score. The PEMOAs present better performance than traditional algorithms, avoiding uninteresting solutions. We introduce a hyper-heuristic version of the PEMOA R-NSGA-II that presents the best results in a general case.},

abstract = {Product line test development is more complicated than test development for a single application, as the former has to deal with variability among assets (artifacts) and is carried out in two separate but related development phases, i.e. domain engineering and application engineering. Different software product test development methods provide different opportunities for reuse depending on how variability is represented in the domain test artifacts, when binding is formed and applied and also when test data are determined. This paper compares and analyzes the six major methods for the software product line test development in the literature. Through the comparison, we find out that existing software product line testing methods did not fully consider the aspects of software product line that are essential for reuse in software product line development such as variability representation, binding formation and application time and test data determination time. As the conclusion of this literature review, this paper suggests future research opportunities for software product line testing to explore.},

abstract = {Display Omitted An architecture to support a SPL for scientific applications.An approach where the semantics is highlighted.Use of ontologies in conjunction with feature models.The implementation of an SSPL.Case studies in the bioinformatics area (sequencing/genetic alignment). ContextMost specialized users (scientists) that use bioinformatics applications do not have suitable training on software development. Software Product Line (SPL) employs the concept of reuse considering that it is defined as a set of systems that are developed from a common set of base artifacts. In some contexts, such as in bioinformatics applications, it is advantageous to develop a collection of related software products, using SPL approach. If software products are similar enough, there is the possibility of predicting their commonalities, differences and then reuse these common features to support the development of new applications in the bioinformatics area. ObjectivesThis paper presents the PL-Science approach which considers the context of SPL and ontology in order to assist scientists to define a scientific experiment, and to specify a workflow that encompasses bioinformatics applications of a given experiment. This paper also focuses on the use of ontologies to enable the use of Software Product Line in biological domains. MethodIn the context of this paper, Scientific Software Product Line (SSPL) differs from the Software Product Line due to the fact that SSPL uses an abstract scientific workflow model. This workflow is defined according to a scientific domain and using this abstract workflow model the products (scientific applications/algorithms) are instantiated. ResultsThrough the use of ontology as a knowledge representation model, we can provide domain restrictions as well as add semantic aspects in order to facilitate the selection and organization of bioinformatics workflows in a Scientific Software Product Line. The use of ontologies enables not only the expression of formal restrictions but also the inferences on these restrictions, considering that a scientific domain needs a formal specification. ConclusionsThis paper presents the development of the PL-Science approach, encompassing a methodology and an infrastructure, and also presents an approach evaluation. This evaluation presents case studies in bioinformatics, which were conducted in two renowned research institutions in Brazil.},

We learned that the outcome of a domain analysis was often a smaller integration scenario instead of an SPL and that business case calculations were less relevant for the stakeholders and managers from the business units during this phase.

Benefits of using this model range from moving from a specialized section or sub-section of a domain that a product line targets to a situation where the product line can be made to be applicable in various situations that involve problems spanning across multiple domains, leave alone a specialized section in a specific domain only, to making the product a highly dynamic and evolvable base resource, such that it virtually never fades out or the longevity of the product line itself being increased manifold This work discusses the various benefits that Software Stability has over the regular Product Line Engineering and how some of Software Stability Model's concepts can make the product lines of today, much better.},

abstract = {Cloning is widely used for creating new product variants. While it has low adoption costs, it often leads to maintenance problems. Long term reliance on cloning is discouraged in favor of systematic reuse offered by product line engineering (PLE) with a central platform integrating all reusable assets. Unfortunately, adopting an integrated platform requires a risky and costly migration. However, industrial experience shows that some benefits of an integrated platform can be achieved by properly managing a set of cloned variants.  In this paper, we propose an incremental and minimally invasive PLE adoption strategy called virtual platform. Virtual platform covers a spectrum of strategies between ad-hoc clone and own and PLE with a fully-integrated platform divided into six governance levels. Transitioning to a governance level requires some effort and it provides some incremental benefits. We discuss tradeoffs among the levels and illustrate the strategy on an example implementation.},

abstract = {Successful Software Product Lines (SPLs) evolve over time. However, one practical problem is that during SPL evolution the core assets, especially the code, tend to become complicated and difficult to understand, use, and maintain. Typically, more and more problems arise over time with implicit or already lost adaptation knowledge about the interdependencies of the different system variants and the supported variability. In this paper, we present a model-based SPL improvement process that analyzes existing large-scale SPL reuse infrastructure to identify improvement potential with respective metrics. Since Conditional Compilation (CC) is one of the most widely used mechanisms to implement variability, we parse variability-related facts from preprocessor code. Then we automatically extract an implementation variability model, including product configuration and variation points that are structured in a hierarchical variability tree. The extraction process is presented with concrete measurement results from an industrial case study.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are a mature approach for the derivation of a family of products using systematic reuse. Different combinations of predefined features enable tailoring the product to fit the needs of each customer. These needs are related to functional properties of the system (optional features) as well as non-functional properties (e.g., performance or cost of the final product). In industrial scenarios, the configuration process of a final product is complex and the tool support is usually limited to check functional properties interdependencies. In addition, the importance of nonfunctional properties as relevant drivers during configuration has been overlooked. Thus, there is a lack of holistic paradigms integrating recommendation systems and visualizations that can help the decision makers. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an interrelated set of visualizations for the configuration process filling these gaps. We integrate them as part of the FeatureIDE tool and we evaluate its effectiveness, scalability, and performance.},

abstract = {A software product line is a family of related software products, typically, generated from a set of common assets. Users can select features to derive a product that fulfills their needs. Often, users expect a product to have specific non-functional properties, such as a small footprint or a minimum response time. Because a product line can contain millions of products, it is usually not feasible to generate and measure non-functional properties for each possible product of a product line. Hence, we propose an approach to predict a product's non-functional properties, based on the product's feature selection. To this end, we generate and measure a small set of products, and by comparing the measurements, we approximate each feature's non-functional properties. By aggregating the approximations of selected features, we predict the product's properties. Our technique is independent of the implementation approach and language. We show how already little domain knowledge can improve predictions and discuss trade-offs regarding accuracy and the required number of measurements. Although our approach is in general applicable for quantifiable non-functional properties, we evaluate it for the non-functional property footprint. With nine case studies, we demonstrate that our approach usually predicts the footprint with an accuracy of 98% and an accuracy of over 99% if feature interactions are known.},

Separately modelling the variability of these QAs from the variability of the base functionality of the application has many advantages (e.g., a better reusability), and facilitates the reconfiguration of the QA variants at runtime. Many factors may vary the QA functionality: variations in the user preferences and usage needs; variations in the non-functional QAs; variations in resources, hardware, or even in the functionality of the base application, that directly affect the product's QAs. In this paper, we aim to elicit the relationships and dependencies between the functionalities required to satisfy the QAs and all those factors that can provoke a reconfiguration of the software architecture at runtime. We follow an approach in which the variability of the QAs is modelled separately from the base application functionality, and propose a dynamic approach to reconfigure the software architecture based on those reconfiguration criteria.},

To realise variability at the code level, product line methods classically advocate usage of inheritance, components, frameworks, aspects or generative techniques. However, these might require unaffordable paradigm shifts for developers if the software was not thought at the outset as a product line. Furthermore, these techniques can be conflicting with a company's coding practices or external regulations. These concerns were the motivation for the industry---university collaboration described in this paper in which we developed a minimally intrusive coding technique based on tags. The approach was complemented with traceability from code to feature diagrams which were exploited for automated configuration. It is supported by a toolchain and is now in use in the partner company for the development of flight-grade satellite communication software libraries.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new style of product line engineering methods. It focuses on constructing embedded systems that take into account the contexts such as the external physical environments. In current product line development projects, Feature Analysis is mainly conducted from the viewpoint of system configurations: how hardware and software components are configured to constitute a system. In most cases, contexts are not considered explicitly. As a result, unexpected and unfavorable behavior might emerge in a system if a developer does not recognize any possible conflicting combinations between the system and contexts. To deal with this problem, this paper provides the notion of a context-dependent product line, which is composed of the system and context lines. The former is obtained by analyzing a family of systems. The latter is obtained by analyzing features of contexts associated to the systems. The system and context lines contain reusable core assets. The configuration of selected system components and contexts can be formally checked at the specification level. In this paper, we show a development process that includes the creation of both product line assets as well as context assets.},

However, testing and debugging of each product, even from the same family, is still done independently. This can be very expensive. To solve this problem, we need to explore how test cases generated for one product can be used for another product. We propose a genetic algorithm-based framework which integrates software fault localization techniques and focuses on reusing test specifications and input values whenever feasible. Case studies using four software product lines and eight fault localization techniques were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Discussions on factors that may affect the effectiveness of the proposed framework is also presented. Our results indicate that test cases generated in such a way can be easily reused (with appropriate conversion) between different products of the same family and help reduce the overall testing and debugging cost.},

abstract = {Support to the quality attribute (QA) &amp; metric selection process.Maintainability is the most studied QA for most domains and development phases.Quality attributes are usually assessed through a correlation to a single metric.Metrics are validated in empirical settings and may lack theoretical validity. Developing a plan for monitoring software quality is a non-trivial task, in the sense that it requires: (a) the selection of relevant quality attributes, based on application domain and development phase, and (b) the selection of appropriate metrics to quantify quality attributes. The metrics selection process is further complicated due to the availability of various metrics for each quality attribute, and the constraints that impact metric selection (e.g., development phase, metric validity, and available tools). In this paper, we shed light on the state-of-research of design-time quality attributes by conducting a mapping study. We have identified 154 papers that have been included as primary studies. The study led to the following outcomes: (a) low-level quality attributes (e.g., cohesion, coupling, etc.) are more frequently studied than high-level ones (e.g., maintainability, reusability, etc.), (b) maintainability is the most frequently examined high-level quality attribute, regardless of the application domain or the development phase, (c) assessment of quality attributes is usually performed by a single metric, rather than a combination of multiple metrics, and (d) metrics are mostly validated in an empirical setting. These outcomes are interpreted and discussed based on related work, offering useful implications to both researchers and practitioners.},

Software is mainly being produced by Automated Code Generators whose correctness can only be assessed meaningfully if the input language semantics is well known. These semantics share a common part but are mainly defined through block libraries. The writing of a complete formal specification for the block libraries of the usual languages is highly challenging due to the high variability of the structure and semantics of each block. This contribution relates the use of software product line principles in the design of a domain specific language targeting the formal specification of block libraries. It summarises the advantages of this DSL regarding the writing, validation and formal verification of such specifications.

abstract = {A software product line is a unified representation of a set of conceptually similar software systems that share many common features and satisfy the requirements of a particular domain. Within the context of software product lines, feature models are tree-like structures that are widely used for modeling and representing the inherent commonality and variability of software product lines. Given the fact that many different software systems can be spawned from a single software product line, it can be anticipated that a low-quality design can ripple through to many spawned software systems. Therefore, the need for early indicators of external quality attributes is recognized in order to avoid the implications of defective and low-quality design during the late stages of production. In this paper, we propose a set of structural metrics for software product line feature models and theoretically validate them using valid measurement-theoretic principles. Further, we investigate through controlled experimentation whether these structural metrics can be good predictors (early indicators) of the three main subcharacteristics of maintainability: analyzability, changeability, and understandability. More specifically, a four-step analysis is conducted: (1) investigating whether feature model structural metrics are correlated with feature model maintainability through the employment of classical statistical correlation techniques; (2) understanding how well each of the structural metrics can serve as discriminatory references for maintainability; (3) identifying the sufficient set of structural metrics for evaluating each of the subcharacteristics of maintainability; and (4) evaluating how well different prediction models based on the proposed structural metrics can perform in indicating the maintainability of a feature model. Results obtained from the controlled experiment support the idea that useful prediction models can be built for the purpose of evaluating feature model maintainability using early structural metrics. Some of the structural metrics show significant correlation with the subjective perception of the subjects about the maintainability of the feature models.},

abstract = {Context: A software product line is a family of related software products, typically created from a set of common assets. Users select features to derive a product that fulfills their needs. Users often expect a product to have specific non-functional properties, such as a small footprint or a bounded response time. Because a product line may have an exponential number of products with respect to its features, it is usually not feasible to generate and measure non-functional properties for each possible product. Objective: Our overall goal is to derive optimal products with respect to non-functional requirements by showing customers which features must be selected. Method: We propose an approach to predict a product's non-functional properties based on the product's feature selection. We aggregate the influence of each selected feature on a non-functional property to predict a product's properties. We generate and measure a small set of products and, by comparing measurements, we approximate each feature's influence on the non-functional property in question. As a research method, we conducted controlled experiments and evaluated prediction accuracy for the non-functional properties footprint and main-memory consumption. But, in principle, our approach is applicable for all quantifiable non-functional properties. Results: With nine software product lines, we demonstrate that our approach predicts the footprint with an average accuracy of 94%, and an accuracy of over 99% on average if feature interactions are known. In a further series of experiments, we predicted main memory consumption of six customizable programs and achieved an accuracy of 89% on average. Conclusion: Our experiments suggest that, with only few measurements, it is possible to accurately predict non-functional properties of products of a product line. Furthermore, we show how already little domain knowledge can improve predictions and discuss trade-offs between accuracy and required number of measurements. With this technique, we provide a basis for many reasoning and product-derivation approaches.},

abstract = {Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted HighlightsThe work proposes a hybrid approach to deal with the Product Portfolio Scope Problem.The approach is composed by a solution to deploy the feature relevance indicated by the customers into code assets of a SPL, based on a systematic method (SQFD).The approach includes a method to estimate the cost of an asset based on common and relevant measures related to source code, together with a fuzzy system to deal with the imprecision to set reference values.The work presents an application of an NSGA-II to search for products minimizing the cost and maximizing the relevance of the candidate products.The approach was evaluated using different scenarios, exploring the mains aspects related to method in the practice: size, granularity of features and products search space.The previous version of our hybrid approach was dependent on the employed technologies and algorithms. Herein we reformulate our approach, detaching it from any particular technique/algorithm.The data collection process associated with our approach was improved to facilitate the hybrid approach's usage and mitigate associated construct validity threats.A more comprehensive evaluation, which focused on show the real word usefulness and scalability of our hybrid approach. To validate the usefulness of our approach, it was used the SPL associated with a tool broadly employed in both industrial and academic contexts (ArgoUML-SPL). The scalability of our approach was evaluated using a synthetic SPL.All the experiments were based on the guidelines defined by Arcuri and Briand in order to evaluate the statistical significance of this kind of work. Software product line (SPL) development is a new approach to software engineering which aims at the development of a whole range of products. However, as long as SPL can be useful, there are many challenges regarding the use of that approach. One of the main problems which hinders the adoption of software product line (SPL) is the complexity regarding product management. In that context, we can remark the scoping problem. One of the existent ways to deal with scoping is the product portfolio scoping (PPS). PPS aims to define the products that should be developed as well as their key features. In general, that approach is driven by marketing aspects, like cost of the product and customer satisfaction. Defining a product portfolio by using the many different available aspects is a NP-hard problem. This work presents an improved hybrid approach to solve the feature model selection problem, aiming at supporting product portfolio scoping. The proposal is based in a hybrid approach not dependent on any particular algorithm/technology. We have evaluated the usefulness and scalability of our approach using one real SPL (ArgoUML-SPL) and synthetic SPLs. As per the evaluation results, our approach is both useful from a practitioner's perspective and scalable.},

This approach promotes benefits such as cost reduction, product quality, productivity and time to market, but it brings new challenges that must be considered during the evolution of the software product line. In this context, recent research has explored and proposed automated approaches based on code analysis and traceability techniques for change impact analysis. This paper presents Squid, an extensible infrastructure for analyzing software product line implementations. The approach uses information from variability modeling, variability mapping to code assets, and dependency relationships between code assets to perform analysis of SPL implementations.

abstract = {Multi Software Product Line (MSPL or simply Multi Product Line - MPL) has recently emerged as a new approach to develop software systems, mainly those large, complex ones. This approach can be investigated to the development of Systems-of-Systems (SoS), i.e., a new class of software systems that are resulted by the integration of several operationally independent systems. In another perspective, a special type of architecture that contains knowledge about a specific domain has been increasingly investigated, resulting in the research area of Reference Architecture. In this context, the main motivation of this paper is that, in spite of the positive impact of this type of architecture on reuse and productivity, the use of the knowledge contained in existing reference architectures in order to develop MPL, specially to develop SoS, has not been widely explored yet. In this scenario, the main objective of this paper is to present a set of perspectives and challenges of research to use reference architectures in the context of MPL. For this, we have based on our previous experience as well as the literature of SPL, SoS, and reference architecture. As result, we have observed that reference architectures together with MPL seems to be a quite promising research topic. To conclude, we also intend this paper can identify new required research in this context, contributing to improve reuse and productivity in MPL.},

abstract = {Adopting Product Line Engineering (PLE) approaches in the context of software-intensive systems reduces overall development and maintenance costs, reduces time to market and leads to an overall improvement in product quality. The Software and System Product Line (SPL) community has provided a large number of different analysis approaches and tools, which were developed in different contexts, answer different questions, and can contribute to the fulfillment of different analysis goals. Typically, these analysis tools are initially developed as part of a research study, where they serve a specific purpose, e. g. for investigating the use of a new technology, or to demonstrate the transfer of methods from other fields. Generally, such purpose is aligned with a specific, but not explicitly stated, high-level goal. The pursuit of these goals requires holistic approaches, i. e. integrated toolchains and classification of analyses, which are documented as a centralized collection of wisdom. Therefore, we propose a classification system which describes existing analyses and reveals possible combinations, i. e. integrated toolchains, and provide first examples. This method supports the search for toolchains which address complex industrial needs. With the support of the SPL community, we hope to collaboratively document existing analyses and corresponding goals on an open platform.},

abstract = {The customer demands of various products bring a challenge for manufacturers. They have to design customized products while maintaining economies of scale and low costs. In this paper, to address this challenge, four approaches are argued to help companies find out the optimal solutions of products’ performance and the maximum profit: (i) only platform modularity without component sharing (ii) only component sharing without platform modularity, (iii) using both platform modularity and component sharing to develop products, or iv) the products are developed individually from a given unshared components set. A theoretical model is proposed and the most profitable approach is found to develop a whole new product family when uncertainty exists in the customer demand and economies of scale with pre-defined parameters. We find that, when consumers’ valuation is considered, the manufacturer may prefer to adopt platform or component sharing individually rather than combining them because the performance of high-end products using platform and component sharing strategies is worse than that using two strategies separately. If platform and component sharing are adopted, the high-end product is under designed, but the manufacturer can benefit from economies of scale. When economies of scale of the platform are greater than or equal to that of component sharing, the optimal performance level of low-end products under platform strategy is lower than that under component sharing strategy. Finally, the detailed numerical analysis provides support for the feasibility and effectiveness of the model.},

This process is vital to the maintenance and evolution of software systems.Software product line engineering is a paradigm for the construction and customization of large-scale software systems. As systems grow in complexity and size, maintaining a clean structure becomes arguably more important. However, product line literature uses the term "refactoring" for such a wide range of reengineering activities that it has become difficult to see how these activities pertain to maintenance and evolution and how they are related.We improve this situation in the following way: i) We identify the dimensions along which product line reengineering occurs. ii) We derive a taxonomy that distinguishes and relates these reengineering activities. iii) We propose definitions for the three main branches of this taxonomy. iv) We classify a corpus of existing work.},

This trend has forced global companies to reconsider their product-positioning strategies. To reduce design cost and shorten the time to market, portfolio analysis for product family design is usually adopted to acquire diverse but related market applications. This study presents a novel framework to implement product differentiation and product configuration. Initially, association rule mining is used to capture user perceptions to identify the significant portfolios of hedonic attributes. Secondly, cognitive pairwise rating is conducted to elicit user preferences for utilitarian attributes (UAs). Finally, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is used to prioritize the optimal portfolios of UAs. Experiment results show that "keyboard interface", "body material", and "screen size" are the most concerned HAs for differentiating the product family while "CPU performance" is the most important UA for configuring padbooks, ultrabooks and notebooks. In summary, this research allows companies to effectively and efficiently incorporate user perceptions or preferences into the entire decision-making process.},

While SPL was very successful at building products based on identified features, achievements and preservation of many nonfunctional properties (NFPs) remain challenging. A knowledge how to deal with NFPs is still not fully obtained. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of NFPs analysis for SPL products, focusing on runtime NFPs. The goal of the paper is twofold: (i) to present an holistic overview of SPL approaches that have been reported regarding the analysis of runtime NFPs, and (ii) to categorize NFPs treated in the scientific literature regarding development of SPLs. We analyzed 36 research papers, and identified that system performance attributes are typically the most considered. The results also aid future research studies in NFPs analysis by providing an unbiased view of the body of empirical evidence and by guiding future research directions.},

abstract = {An approach for the representation, the retrieval and the reuse of design knowledge for product families design is proposed.All methods in literature rely on (at least) a partial representation based on natural language.The relation between the natural language and the ambiguity of the retrieval (and the consequent reuse) is highlighted.An anti-logicist approach to unambiguously represent the design knowledge.The impacts on the ambiguity of the retrieval and the reuse for the product family design are tested on an industrial case. The product family design is a design approach to meet the demand of customisable products. This paper deals with the knowledge representation, retrieval and reuse supporting the design stage of product families. Usually, the methods in the literature do not focus on the retrieve and the reusability of the knowledge. In other words, they do not ensure if a non-expert user can effectively retrieve and reuse the represented knowledge. To cope with this point, here, the aim is to apply an anti-logicist approach for the unambiguous design-knowledge representation to support the unambiguous retrieval and the automatic reuse of the knowledge during a product family design stage. The retrieval is unambiguous because the link between the knowledge models and the requirements is based on a syntax comparison, e.g. intervals of numbers, units of measure. An algorithm for the automatic reuse has been developed: provided an unambiguous definition of the new requirements related to the product family, the algorithm's outputs are the functional and physical definitions of all the products included in the product families, i.e. performances and CAD files. The case study is a family of components of the HVAC (heating, ventilating and air-conditioning) systems sector. Finally the advantages and issues of a potential industrial implementation are discussed.},

ContextExperience curve is a well-known concept in management and education science, which explains the phenomenon of increased worker efficiency with repetitive production of a good or service. ObjectiveWe aim to analyze the impact of the experience curve effect on the Return on Investment (ROI) in the software product line engineering (SPLE) process. MethodWe first present the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) to explicitly depict the studies that have considered the impact of experience curve effect on software development in general. Subsequently, based on the results of the SLR, the experience curve effect models in the literature, and the SPLE cost models, we define an approach for extending the cost models with the experience curve effect. Finally, we discuss the application of the refined cost models in a real industrial context. ResultsThe SLR resulted in 15 primary studies which confirm the impact of experience curve effect on software development in general but the experience curve effect in the adoption of SPLE got less attention. The analytical discussion of the cost models and the application of the refined SPLE cost models in the industrial context showed a clear impact of the experience curve effect on the time-to-market, cost of development and ROI in the SPLE adoption process. ConclusionsThe proposed analysis with the newly defined cost models for SPLE adoption provides a more precise analysis tool for the management, and as such helps to support a better decision making.},

abstract = {Adaptability and reusability are important quality attributes for software targeted for global market due to diverse market needs, ever increasing number of features, rapidly changing technologies, and various laws/standards of different countries. In response to these requirements, software development organizations are interested in product line engineering and searching for support tools. However, most of the existing tools for supporting product line engineering focus only on providing mechanisms for instantiating products without adequately supporting development of software assets that are adaptable and reusable.To address this problem, we provide a CASE tool, called VULCAN, that provides architecture models/patterns that are adaptable/reusable and also supports mechanisms for instantiating products from assets. We have applied VULCAN to various product lines including glucose management systems and elevator control systems, and we could experience that maintainability of the assets has improved substantially because a large portion of the assets are specifications rather than low-level code and product-specific code is generated from the specifications.},

abstract = {Consumers, industry, and government entities are becoming increasingly concerned about the issue of global warming. With this in mind, manufacturers have begun to develop products with consideration of low-carbon. In recent years, many companies are utilizing product families to satisfy various customer needs with lower costs. However, little research has been conducted on the development of a product family that considers environmental factors. In this paper, a low-carbon product family design that integrates environmental concerns is proposed. To this end, a new method of platform planning is investigated with considerations of cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission of a product family simultaneously. In this research, a low-carbon product family design problem is described at first, and then a GHG emission model of product family is established. Furthermore, to support low-carbon product family design, an optimization method is applied to make a significant trade-off between cost and GHG emission to implement a feasible platform planning. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated through a case study. We present a new planning method of product platform, called low-carbon product family design.We establish a bi-objective optimization model that minimizes costs and greenhouse gas emission of a product family.An optimization method is proposed to solve the bi-objective optimization problem.Our case study shows that there is a tradeoff between cost and GHG emission in product platform planning.},

More cost-effective and agile as they are than traditional development methods for producing families of similar products, SPLMs still seem to be heavy weight in nature. In SPLMs, significant up-front commitments are involved in development of a flexible product platform, which will be modified into a range of products sharing common features. Agile Methods AMs share similar goals with SPLMs, e.g., on rapidly delivering high quality software that meets the changing needs of stakeholders. However, they appear to differ significantly practices. The purpose of this work is to compare Agile and Software Product line approaches from fundamental goals/principles, engineering, software quality assurance, sand project management perspectives, etc. The results of the study can be used to determine the feasibility of tailoring a software product line approach with Agile practices, resulting in a lighter-weight approach that provides mass customization, reduced time-to-market, and improved customer satisfaction.},

abstract = {Context: ''Reuse'' and ''Model Based Development'' are two prominent trends for improving industrial development efficiency. Product lines are used to reduce the time to create product variants by reusing components. The model based approach provides the opportunity to enhance knowledge capture for a system in the early stages in order to be reused throughout its lifecycle. This paper describes how these two trends are combined to support development and support of a simulator product line for the SAAB 39 Gripen fighter aircraft. Objective: The work aims at improving the support (in terms of efficiency and quality) when creating simulation model configurations. Software based simulators are flexible so variants and versions of included models may easily be exchanged. The objective is to increase the reuse when combining models for usage in a range of development and training simulators. Method: The research has been conducted with an interactive approach using prototyping and demonstrations, and the evaluation is based on an iterative and a retrospective method. Results: A product line of simulator models for the SAAB 39 Gripen aircraft has been analyzed and defined in a Product Variant Master. A configurator system has been implemented for creation, integration, and customization of stringent simulator model configurations. The system is currently under incorporation in the standard development process at SAAB Aeronautics. Conclusion: The explicit and visual description of products and their variability through a configurator system enables better insights and a common understanding so that collaboration on possible product configurations improves and the potential of software reuse increases. The combination of application fields imposes constraints on how traditional tools and methods may be utilized. Solutions for Design Automation and Knowledge Based Engineering are available, but their application has limitations for Software Product Line engineering and the reuse of simulation models.},

In SPL, a feature tree portrays various types of features as well as captures the relationships among them. This paper applies BN in modeling and analyzing features in a feature tree. Various feature analysis rules are first modeled and then verified in BN. The verification confirms the definition of the rules and thus these rules can be used in various decision making stages in SPL.},

abstract = {In software product lines (SPL), i.e., a family of similar software systems sharing common and variable artifacts, modeling evolution and reasoning about it is challenging, as not only a single system, but rather a set of system variants as well as their interdependencies change. An integrated modeling formalism for variability and evolution is required to allow the capturing of evolution operations that are applied to SPL artifacts, and to facilitate the impact analysis of evolution on the artifact level. Delta modeling is a flexible transformational variability modeling approach, where the variability and commonality between variants are explicitly documented and analyzable by means of transformations modeled as deltas. In this paper, we lift the notion of delta modeling to capture both, variability and evolution, by deltas. We evolve a delta model specifying a set of variants by applying higher-order deltas. A higher-order delta encapsulates evolution operations, i.e., additions, removals, or modifications of deltas, and transforms a delta model in its new version. In this way, we capture the complete evolution history of delta-oriented SPLs by higher-order delta models. By analyzing each higher-order delta application, we are further able to reason about the impact and, thus, the changes to the specified set of variants. We prototypically implement our formalism and show its applicability using a system from the automation engineering domain.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPL) are generally specified using a Feature Model (FM), an artifact designed in the early stages of the SPL development life cycle. This artifact can quickly become too complex, which makes it challenging to maintain an SPL. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the artifact's maintainability continuously. The literature brings some approaches that evaluate FM maintainability through the aggregation of maintainability measures. Machine Learning (ML) models can be used to create these approaches. They can aggregate the values of independent variables into a single target data, also called a dependent variable. Besides, when using white-box ML models, it is possible to interpret and explain the ML model results. This work proposes white-box ML models intending to classify the FM maintainability based on 15 measures. To build the models, we performed the following steps: (i) we compared two approaches to evaluate the FM maintainability through a human-based oracle of FM maintainability classifications; (ii) we used the best approach to pre-classify the ML training dataset; (iii) we generated three ML models and compared them against classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and AUC-ROC; and, (iv) we used the best model to create a mechanism capable of providing improvement indicators to domain engineers. The best model used the decision tree algorithm that obtained accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.81, F1-Score of 0.79, and AUC-ROC of 0.91. Using this model, we could reduce the number of measures needed to evaluate the FM maintainability from 15 to 9 measures.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering practices offer desirable characteristics such as rapid product development, reduced time-to-market, and more affordable development costs as a result of systematic representation of the variabilities of a domain of discourse that leads to methodical reuse of software assets. The development lifecycle of a product line consists of two main phases: domain engineering, which deals with the understanding and formally modeling of the target domain, and application engineering that is concerned with the configuration of a product line into one concrete product based on the preferences and requirements of the stakeholders. The work presented in this paper focuses on the application engineering phase and builds both the theoretical and technological tools to assist the stakeholders in (a) understanding the complex interactions of the features of a product line; (b) eliciting the utility of each feature for the stakeholders and hence exposing the stakeholders' otherwise implicit preferences in a way that they can more easily make decisions; and (c) dynamically building a decision model through interaction with the stakeholders and by considering the structural characteristics of software product line feature models, which will guide the stakeholders through the product configuration process. Initial exploratory empirical experiments that we have performed show that our proposed approach for helping stakeholders understand their feature preferences and its associated staged feature model configuration process is able to positively impact the quality of the end results of the application engineering process within the context of the limited number of participants. In addition, it has been observed that the offered tooling support is able to ease the staged feature model configuration process.},

Architectural styles help to improve the Product Line Architecture (PLA) design by providing a better organization of its elements, which results in some benefits, like flexibility, extensibility and maintainability. The PLA design can also be improved by using a search based optimization approach, taking into account different metrics, such as cohesion, coupling and feature modularization. However, the application of search operators changes the PLA organization, and consequently may violate the architectural styles rules, impacting negatively in the architecture understanding. To overcome such limitation, this work introduces a set of search operators to be used in the search based design with the goal of preserving the architectural styles during the optimization process. Such operators consider rules of the layered and client/server architectural styles, generally used in the search based design of conventional architectures and PLAs. The operators are implemented and evaluated in the context of MOA4PLA, a Multi-objective Optimization Approach for PLA Design. Results from an empirical evaluation show that the proposed operators contribute to obtain better solutions, preserving the adopted style and also improving some software metric values.},

abstract = {To keep the software development for vehicles cost efficient, software components are reused for different variants as well as for succeeding generations. Furthermore, cost reductions are achieved by software sharing between the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and the suppliers. However, as a consequence of the blackboxed view caused by software sharing, no common detailed software product line architecture specification for the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) software exists, as it would be required for analyzing the quality of the product line architecture, planning changes on the product line architecture, checking the compliance between the product architecture and the product line architecture, and therefore, avoiding architecture erosion. Thus, after several product generations, software erosion is growing steadily, resulting in an increasing effort of reusing software components, and planning of further development. Here, we propose an approach for repairing an eroded software consisting of a set of product architectures by applying strategies for recovery and discovery of the product line architecture. Furthermore, we give a methodology for a long-term manageable, plannable, and reuseable software product line architecture for automotive software systems.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software systems distinguished by the set of features each one provides. The commonly large number of variants that can be derived from an SPL poses a unique set of challenges, because it is not feasible to test all the individual variants. Over the last few years many approaches for SPL testing have been devised. They usually select a set of variants to test based on some covering criterion. A problem when evaluating these testing approaches is properly comparing them to one another. Even though some benchmarks have been proposed, they focus on covering criteria and do not consider fault data in their analysis. Considering the dire lack of publicly available fault data, in this paper we present the first results of our ongoing project to introduce simulated faults into SPLs along with using evolutionary techniques for synthesizing unit test cases for SPL examples.},

On behalf of the government and based on promotional directives, KfW grants retail loans to small and medium enterprises, business founders, self-employed professionals, municipalities and private individuals. The promotional directives, called programs, define mandatory and optional properties of these loans. We have now successfully built a feature model from these properties.Our feature model will be presented with its outstanding characteristic, which is an additional subtree containing the programs as features. Complete and correct cross-tree constraints will also allow us to analyze and scope the portfolio, reduce complexity, and speed-up time-to-market. This is the advent of product line development at KfW.In order to standardize our portfolio, we have subsequently developed tools on top of the feature model, namely, a browser-based, multi-user configurator assisting non-technical-affine users in their product design, and a generator producing complete product documentation from the feature model and partial configurations. More applications are currently underway.This is our story of applying Software Product Line Engineering in banking, a domain where it is unusual or even unknown. We share our ideas, analyses, progress, and findings where the results have been thrilling us for the past two years and will continue to do so.},

abstract = {Product lines that use automated tools to configure shared assets (e.g., software or requirements or test cases or user documentation) based on product descriptions have long been known to bring about substantial development cost avoidance when compared to clone-and-own or product-specific development techniques. Now, however, it can be shown that the cost avoidance for configuring multiple shared assets is superlinear -- that is, the overall cost avoidance exceeds the sum of the that brought about by working with each of the shared assets in isolation. That is, a product line that configures (for example) requirements and code will avoid more cost than the sum of code-based plus requirements-based cost avoidance. In addition, we also observe a superlinear effect in terms of the number of products in the portfolio as well.

abstract = {The goals of cross-product reuse in a software product line (SPL) are to mitigate production costs and improve the quality. In addition to reuse across products, due to the evolutionary development process, a SPL also exhibits reuse across releases. In this paper, we empirically explore how the two types of reuse--reuse across products and reuse across releases--affect the quality of a SPL and our ability to accurately predict fault proneness. We measure the quality in terms of post-release faults and consider different levels of reuse across products (i.e., common, high-reuse variation, low-reuse variation, and single-use packages), over multiple releases. Assessment results showed that quality improved for common, low-reuse variation, and single-use packages as they evolved across releases. Surprisingly, within each release, among preexisting (`old') packages, the cross-product reuse did not affect the change and fault proneness. Cross-product predictions based on pre-release data accurately ranked the packages according to their post-release faults and predicted the 20 % most faulty packages. The predictions benefited from data available for other products in the product line, with models producing better results (1) when making predictions on smaller products (consisting mostly of common packages) rather than on larger products and (2) when trained on larger products rather than on smaller products.},

abstract = {The Product Line Architecture (PLA) of a Software Product Line (SPL) is the core architecture that represents a high-level design for all the products of an SPL, including variation points and variants. If PLA documentation is missing, it can be recovered by reverse engineering the products. The recovered PLA is a relevant asset for developers and architects, that can be used to drive specific activities of SPL development and evolution, such as, understanding its structure and its variation points, and assessing reuse. This paper presents an exploratory study that investigated the effectiveness of recovered PLAs to address variability identification and support reuse assessment. We recovered the PLA of 15 open source SPL projects using the PLAR, a tool that supports PLA recovery and assessment based on information extracted from SPL products' source code. For each project, reuse assessment was supported by existing reuse metrics. The yielded results revealed that the number of products used in PLA recovery affected the variability identification, and the number of optional features affected the components reuse rate. These findings suggest that a minimum set of representative products should be identified and selected for PLA recovery, and the component reuse rate is a candidate metric for SPL reuse assessment.},

Delta Modeling (DM) is a transformational approach for implementing MBSPLs by adding, removing or modifying model elements through delta modules to activate individual features. To date, the applicability of DM to real-world MBSPLs is severely hindered due to the resulting complex network of interrelated delta modules in which errors are hard to identify and fix without unintentionally harming overall consistency. To address this challenge, we present a set of analyses to identify problems in a network of delta modules as well as a construction kit to assemble refactorings to remedy these problems and simplify the network. We give a modeling-language independent formalization of delta modules based on graph transformation concepts. This is the basis for our analyses which, in turn, build the basis for our refactorings to prevent unintended side-effects.},

abstract = {The architectural decision-making process is a complex and crucial endeavor in companies that develop large and distributed software systems. In this process, choosing and evaluating a solution for each architectural issue depends on decision drivers. The drivers are mainly the business factors (e.g., cost, time-to-market, etc.) and software quality attributes (e.g., security, adaptability, etc.). This paper examines whether there is agreement among experts in associating (i.e., relating) architectural issues with relevant quality attributes. We conducted a survey with 37 experts from several industrial domains who, at least once a month, make one or more architectural decisions. The results show there is poor agreement among these experts in identifying and scoring relevant quality attributes for each architectural issue. Poor agreement implies that the associating task is subjective, and that experts inconsistently define and interpret the relevance of various quality attributes for a given architectural issue that may hurt the sustainability of their architectural decisions. This paper suggests that practitioners in their decision-making should employ approaches that are more systematic. The approaches should be supported by methods and tools designed to diminish the biases of intuitive, experience-based approaches of associating architectural issues with quality attributes.},

Search-based approaches can provide automated discovery of near-optimal PLAs and make its design less dependent on human architects.

In this sense, we review existing architecture representations proposed by related work, but all of them need to be extended to encompass specific characteristics of SPL. Then, the use of such representations for PLA is discussed and, based on the performed analysis, we introduce a novel direct PLA representation for search-based optimization. Some implementation aspects are discussed involving implementation details about the proposed PLA representation, constraints and impact on specific search operators. Ongoing work addresses the application of specific search operators for the proposed representation and the definition of a fitness function to be applied in a multi-objective search-based approach for the PLA design.},

abstract = {Reuse of software is a promising approach to improving the efficiency of software development regarding time, cost and quality. Reuse requires a systematic approach. The best results are achieved if we focus on systems in a specific domain, so-called product line. The key difference between the conventional software engineering and software product line engineering is variant management. The main idea of software product line is to identify the common core functionality which can be implemented once and reused afterwards for all members of the product line. To facilitate this reuse opportunity the domain engineering phase makes the domain model comprising the common as well as variant requirements. In principle, common requirements among systems in a family are easy to handle. However, problem arises during handling variants. Different variants have dependencies on each other; a single variant can affect several variants of the domain model. These problems become complex when the volume of information grows in a domain and there are a lot of variants with several interdependencies. Hence, a separate model is required for handling the variants. This paper presents a mechanism, which we call, Unified Tabular Method to facilitate the management of variant dependencies in product lines. The tabular method consists of a variant part to model the variants and their dependencies, and a decision table to depict the customization decision regarding each variant while deriving customized products. Tabular method alleviates the problem of possible explosion of variant combinations and facilitates the tracing of variant information in the domain model},

The approach can support product line differences in platforms and functions, and generate both product line code and product code.

The main idea of SPL is to identify the common core functionality that can be implemented once and reused afterwards. A variant model has also to be developed to manage the variants of the SPL. Usually, a domain model consisting of the common and variant requirements is developed during domain engineering phase to alleviate the reuse opportunity. The authors present a product line model comprising of a variant part for the management of variant and a decision table to depict the customization of decision regarding each variant. Feature diagrams are widely used to model SPL variants. Both feature diagram and our variant model, which is based on tabular method, lacks logically sound formal representation and hence, not amenable to formal verification. Formal representation and verification of SPL has gained much interest in recent years. This chapter presents a logical representation of the variant model by using first order logic. With this representation, the table based variant model as well as the graphical feature diagram can now be verified logically. Besides applying first-order-logic to model the features, the authors also present an approach to model and analyze SPL model by using semantic web approach using OWL-DL. The OWL-DL representation also facilitates the search and maintenance of feature models and support knowledge sharing within a reusable engineering context. Reasoning tools are used to verify the consistency of the feature configuration for both logic-based and semantic web-based approaches.},

To make this possible, software designers should be able to predict quality attributes by reasoning on a model of the system under development. Although there exists a variety of quality-driven analysis techniques for software systems, only a few work address software product lines. This paper describes how probabilistic model checking techniques and tools can be used to verify non-functional properties of different configurations of a software product line. We propose a model-based approach that enables software engineers to assess their design solutions for software product lines in the early stages of development. Furthermore, we discuss how the analysis time can be surprisingly reduced by applying parametric model checking instead of classic model checking. The results show that the parametric approach is able to substantially alleviate the verification time and effort required to analyze non-functional properties of software product lines.},

This problem scales if cloning is used in classes that derive products in a Software Product Line, because these classes can impact in several features and products. However, it is hard to know to which extent cloning in customization classes can impact in a project. We conduct a study, within an SPL that generates mobile software for over 150 countries, to analyze cloning practices and how cloned parts relate to the maintainability of customization classes. We collect and identify clones inside customization classes during a period of 13 months, involving 70 customization classes and 5 branches. In parallel, we collect the respective issues from the issue tracking tool of the SPL project, obtaining over 140 issues related to customization classes. We then confront the time spent to solve each issue with its nature (i.e., if it relates to cloned code or not). As first result, we verify that issues related to cloning take in average 136% more time to be solved. Our study helps to understand how cloning relates to maintainability in the context of mass customization, giving insights about cloned code evolution and its impacts in a software product line project.},

abstract = {ContextThe development of distributed software systems has become an important problem for the software engineering community. Service-based applications are a common solution for this kind of systems. Services provide a uniform mechanism for discovering, integrating and using these resources. In the development of service based applications not only the functionality of services and compositions should be considered, but also conditions in which the system operates. These conditions are called non-functional requirements (NFR). The conformance of applications to NFR is crucial to deliver software that meets the expectations of its users. ObjectiveThis paper presents the results of a systematic mapping carried out to analyze how NFR have been addressed in the development of service-based applications in the last years, according to different points of view. MethodOur analysis applies the systematic mapping approach. It focuses on the analysis of publications organized by categories called facets, which are combined to answer specific research questions. The facets compose a classification schema which is part of the contribution and results. ResultsThis paper presents our findings on how NFR have been supported in the development of service-based applications by proposing a classification scheme consisting in five facets: (i) programming paradigm (object/service oriented); (ii) contribution (methodology, system, middleware); (iii) software process phase; (iv) technique or mathematical model used for expressing NFR; and (v) the types of NFR addressed by the papers, based on the classification proposed by the ISO/IEC 9126 specification. The results of our systematic mapping are presented as bubble charts that provide a quantitative analysis to show the frequencies of publications for each facet. The paper also proposes a qualitative analysis based on these plots. This analysis discusses how NFR (quality properties) have been addressed in the design and development of service-based applications, including methodologies, languages and tools devised to support different phases of the software process. ConclusionThis systematic mapping showed that NFR are not fully considered in all software engineering phases for building service based applications. The study also let us conclude that work has been done for providing models and languages for expressing NFR and associated middleware for enforcing them at run time. An important finding is that NFR are not fully considered along all software engineering phases and this opens room for proposing methodologies that fully model NFR. The data collected by our work and used for this systematic mapping are available in https://github.com/placidoneto/systematic-mapping_service-based-app_nfr.},

abstract = {Although software product lines are widely used in practice, their maintenance is challenging. Features as units of behaviour can be heavily scattered across the source code of a product line, hindering modular reasoning. To alleviate this problem, feature interfaces aim at enhancing modular reasoning about features. However, considering all members of a feature interface is often cumbersome, especially due to the large number of members arising in practice. To address this problem, we present an approach to group members of a feature interface based on their mutual dependencies. We argue that often only a subset of all interface members is relevant to a maintenance task. Therefore, we propose a graph representation that is able to capture the collaboration between members and apply a clustering algorithm to it to group highly-related members and segregate non-related members. On a set of ten versions of a real-world product line, we evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, by comparing the two types of feature interfaces (segregated vs. original interfaces) with co-change information from the version-control system. We found a potential reduction of 62% of the interface members to be considered during maintenance. This way, the effort to reason about features can be reduced.},

abstract = {In the development of a Software Product Line (SPL), it is useful to compare various products in order to identify reusable assets and synthesize them in an optimized way. Current differencing approaches provide the difference on a low level thus still leaves the SPL practitioner considerable manual synthesis work. This paper presents a comparison approach based on Common Variability Language (CVL), which is able to identify the difference on a higher conceptual level. We believe that our CVL Compare approach will offer better model comparison support in the context of identifying and synthesizing SPLs.},

International standards have emerged, but they remain at a quite abstract level, mostly setting terminology.This paper reports intermediate results in an effort aimed at defining a global model of CBTC, by mixing semi-formal modelling and product line engineering. The effort has been based on an in-depth market analysis, not limiting to particular aspects but considering as far as possible the whole picture.

abstract = {In a product line engineering, several studies have been made on analysis of feature which determines commonality and variability of product. Fundamentally, because the studies are based on developer's intuition and domain expert's experience, stakeholders lack common understanding of feature and a feature analysis is informal and subjective. Moreover, the reusability of software products, which were developed, is insufficient. This paper proposes an approach to analyzing commonality and variability of features using semantic-based analysis criteria which is able to change feature model of specific domain to featureontology. For the purpose, first feature attributes were made, create a feature model following the Meta model, transform it into feature-ontology, and save it to Meta feature-ontology repository. Henceforth, when we construct a feature model of the same product line, commonality and variability of the features can be extracted, comparing it with Meta feature ontology through a semantic similarity analysis method, which is proposed. Furthermore, a tool for a semantic similarity-comparing algorithm was implemented and an experiment with an electronic approval system domain in order to show the efficiency of the approach Was conducted. A Meta feature model can definitely be created through this approach, to construct a high-quality feature model based on common understanding of a feature. The main contributions are a formulating a method of extracting commonality and variability from features using ontology based on semantic similarity mapping and a enhancement of reusability of feature model.},

abstract = {Context: Numerous approaches are available for modeling product lines and their variability. However, the long-term impacts of model-based development on maintenance effort and model complexity can hardly be investigated due to a lack of empirical data. Conducting empirical research in product line engineering is difficult as companies are typically reluctant to provide access to data from their product lines. Also, many benefits of product lines can be measured only in longitudinal studies, which are difficult to perform in most environments. Objective: In this paper, we thus aim to explore the benefit of simulation to investigate the evolution of model-based product lines. Method: We present a simulation approach for exploring the effects of product line evolution on model complexity and maintenance effort. Our simulation considers characteristics of product lines (e.g., size, dependencies in models) and we experiment with different evolution profiles (e.g., technical refactoring vs. placement of new products). Results: We apply the approach in a simulation experiment that uses data from real-world product lines from the domain of industrial automation systems to demonstrate its feasibility. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that simulation contributes to understanding the effects of maintenance and evolution in model-based product lines.},

abstract = {Software product lines (SPLs) are used in industry to develop families of similar software systems. Legacy systems, either highly configurable or with a story of versions and local variations, are potential candidates for reconfiguration as SPLs using reengineering techniques. Existing SPLs can also be restructured using specific refactorings to improve their internal quality. Although many contributions (including industrial experiences) can be found in the literature, we lack a global vision covering the whole life cycle of an evolving product line. This study aims to survey existing research on the reengineering of legacy systems into SPLs and the refactoring of existing SPLs in order to identify proven approaches and pending challenges for future research in both subfields. We launched a systematic mapping study to find as much literature as possible, covering the diverse terms involved in the search string (restructuring, refactoring, reengineering, etc. always connected with SPLs) and filtering the papers using relevance criteria. The 74 papers selected were classified with respect to several dimensions: main focus, research and contribution type, academic or industrial validation if included, etc. We classified the research approaches and analyzed their feasibility for use in industry. The results of the study indicate that the initial works focused on the adaptation of generic reengineering processes to SPL extraction. Starting from that foundation, several trends have been detected in recent research: the integrated or guided reengineering of (typically object-oriented) legacy code and requirements; specific aspect-oriented or feature-oriented refactoring into SPLs, and more recently, refactoring for the evolution of existing product lines. A majority of papers include academic or industrial case studies, though only a few are based on quantitative data. The degree of maturity of both subfields is different: Industry examples for the reengineering of the legacy system subfield are abundant, although more evaluation research is needed to provide better evidence for adoption in industry. Product line evolution through refactoring is an emerging topic with some pending challenges. Although it has recently received some attention, the theoretical foundation is rather limited in this subfield and should be addressed in the near future. To sum up, the main contributions of this work are the classification of research approaches as well as the analysis of remaining challenges, open issues, and research opportunities.},

We improve the performance of the multi-objective optimization of SPLs in Alloy by several orders of magnitude with two techniques.First, we rewrite the model to remove binary relations that map to integers, which enables removing most of the integer atoms from the universe. SPL models often require using large bitwidths, hence the number of integer atoms in the universe can be orders of magnitude more than the other atoms. In our approach, the tuples for these integer-valued relations are computed outside the sat solver before returning the solution to the user. Second, we add a checkpointing facility to Kodkod, which allows the multi-objective optimization algorithm to reuse previously computed internal sat solver state, after backtracking.Together these result in orders of magnitude improvement in using Alloy as a multi-objective optimization tool for software product lines.},

Simultaneously, incidence relation of platform parameters could be taken as relaxation constraints, and genetic algorithm is applied to solve the leader-follower correlation optimisation model of the product family.

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) engineering implements self-adaptive systems by dynamically binding or unbinding features at runtime according to a feature model. However, these features may interact in unexpected and undesired ways leading to critical consequences for the DSPL. Moreover, (re)configurations may negatively affect the runtime system's architectural qualities, manifesting architectural bad smells. These issues are challenging to detect due to the combinatorial explosion of the number of interactions amongst features. As some of them may appear at runtime, we need a runtime approach to their analysis and mitigation. This thesis introduces the Behavioral Map (BM) formalism that captures information from different sources (feature model, code) to automatically detect these issues. We provide behavioral map inference algorithms. Using the Smart Home Environment (SHE) as a case study, we describe how a BM is helpful to identify critical feature interactions and architectural smells. Our preliminary results already show promising progress for both feature interactions and architectural bad smells identification at runtime.},

abstract = {Context: During the definition of software product lines (SPLs) it is necessary to choose the components that appropriately fulfil a product's intended functionalities, including its quality requirements (i.e., security, performance, scalability). The selection of the appropriate set of assets from many possible combinations is usually done manually, turning this process into a complex, time-consuming, and error-prone task. Objective: Our main objective is to determine whether, with the use of modeling tools, we can simplify and automate the definition process of a SPL, improving the selection process of reusable assets. Method: We developed a model-driven strategy based on the identification of critical points (sensitivity points) inside the SPL architecture. This strategy automatically selects the components that appropriately match the product's functional and quality requirements. We validated our approach experimenting with different real configuration and derivation scenarios in a mobile healthcare SPL where we have worked during the last three years. Results: Through our SPL experiment, we established that our approach improved in nearly 98% the selection of reusable assets when compared with the unassisted analysis selection. However, using our approach there is an increment in the time required for the configuration corresponding to the learning curve of the proposed tools. Conclusion: We can conclude that our domain-specific modeling approach significantly improves the software architect's decision making when selecting the most suitable combinations of reusable components in the context of a SPL.},

In particular, when maintaining a SPL feature, developers need to know which parts of other dependent features might be affected by this maintenance. Otherwise, further maintenance problems can be introduced in the SPL implementation. However, the identification and understanding of the so-called feature dependencies in the source code are an exhaustive and error-prone task. In fact, developers often ignore unconsciously feature dependencies while reasoning about SPL maintenance. To overcome this problem, this PhD research aims at understanding the properties of feature dependencies in the source code that exert impact on SPL maintenance. Furthermore, we propose a way to structure and segregate feature interfaces in order to help developers to identify and understand feature dependencies, thus reducing the effort and avoiding undesirable side effects in SPL maintenance.},

abstract = {Conventional methods for product family architecture design are informal and limit the support for architecture communication, synthesis and documentation.A formal computational approach requires the integration to configuration systems, improved generic models and extended structural analysis methods.Product family architectures can be modelled interchangeably with generic design-structure matrixes, generic node-link diagrams and product variant masters.Supportive tools automate the documentation and formalize the synthesis of architectures, thereby making any decision about a preferred solution explicit and transparent. With product customization companies aim at creating higher customer value and stronger economic benefits. The profitability of the offered variety relies on the quality of the developed product family architectures and their consistent implementation in configuration systems. Yet existing methods are informal, providing limited support for domain experts to communicate, synthesize and document architectures effectively. In single product design explicit visual models such as design structure matrices and node-link diagrams have been used in combination with structural analysis methods to overcome the limitation of the informal approach. Drawing on thereto established best practises, this paper evaluates and extends the relevant methods and modelling techniques, to create a consistent and formal approach for the design and customization of entire product families. To validate it's applicability, the approach is tested on a case study at a manufacturing company offering bespoke industrial applications. A generic modelling method termed the integrated design model (IDM) is developed and complemented with a computational structural analysis method, to assist domain experts in their daily work. When combined with a configuration system, the presented IDM tool automates the documentation and formalizes the synthesis of architectures, thereby making any decision about a preferred solution explicit and transparent.},

abstract = {Meshing tools are highly complex software for generating and managing geometrical discretizations. Due to their complexity, they have generally been developed by end users - physicists, forest engineers, mechanical engineers - with ad hoc methodologies and not by applying well established software engineering practices. Different meshing tools have been developed over the years, making them a good application domain for Software Product Lines (SPLs). This paper proposes building a domain model that captures the different domain characteristics such as features, goals, scenarios and a lexicon, and the relationships among them. The model is partly specified using a formal language. The domain model captures product commonalities and variabilities as well as the particular characteristics of different SPL products. The paper presents a rigorous process for building the domain model, where specific roles, activities and artifacts are identified. This process also clearly establishes consistency and completeness conditions. The usefulness of the model and the process are validated by using them to generate a software product line of Tree Stem Deformation (TSD) meshing tools. We also present Meshing Tool Generator, a software that follows the SPL approach for generating meshing tools belonging to the TSD SPL. We show how an end user can easily generate three different TSD meshing tools using Meshing Tool Generator.},

abstract = {Modularity benefits, including the independent maintenance and comprehension of individual modules, have been widely advocated. However, empirical assessments to investigate those benefits have mostly focused on source code, and thus, the relevance of modularity to earlier artifacts is still not so clear (such as requirements and design models). In this paper, we use a multimethod technique, including designed experiments, to empirically evaluate the benefits of modularity in the context of two approaches for specifying product line use case scenarios: PLUSS and MSVCM. The first uses an annotative approach for specifying variability, whereas the second relies on aspect-oriented constructs for separating common and variant scenario specifications. After evaluating these approaches through the specifications of several systems, we find out that MSVCM reduces feature scattering and improves scenario cohesion. These results suggest that evolving a product line specification using MSVCM requires only localized changes. On the other hand, the results of six experiments reveal that MSVCM requires more time to derive the product line specifications and, contrasting with the modularity results, reduces the time to evolve a product line specification only when the subjects have been well trained and are used to the task of evolving product line specifications.},

Software product line (SPL) engineering has been applied in several domains, especially in large-scale software development. Given the benefits experienced and reported, SPL engineering has increasingly garnered interest from small to medium-sized companies. It is possible to find a wide range of studies reporting on the challenges of running a SPL project in large companies. However, very little reports exist that consider the situation for small to medium-sized enterprises and these studies try develop universal truths for SPL without lessons learned from empirical evidence need to be contextualized. This study is a step towards bridging this gap in contextual evidence by characterizing the weaknesses discovered in the scoping (SC) and requirements (RE) disciplines of SPL. Moreover, in this study we conducted a case study in a small to medium sized enterprises (SMEs) to justify the use of agile methods when introducing the SPL SC and RE disciplines through the characterization of their bottlenecks. The results of the characterization indicated that ineffective communication and collaboration, long iteration cycles, and the absence of adaptability and flexibility can increase the effort and reduce motivation during project development. These issues can be mitigated by agile methods.},

abstract = {This paper details the application of Software Product Lines (SPL)16 and Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)15 to the software defined radio domain. More specifically it is an experience report emphasizing the synergy 17 resulting from combining MDE and SPL technologies. The software defined radio domain has very unique characteristics as its systems typically are a confluence of a number of typically challenging aspects of software development. To name a few, these systems are usually described by modifiers such as, embedded, real-time, distributed, object-oriented, portable, heterogeneous, multithreaded, high performance, dynamic, resource-constrained, safety-critical, secure, networked, component based and fault-tolerant. Each one of these modifiers by themselves carries with it a set of unique challenges, but building systems characterized by all of these modifiers all at the same time makes for a daunting task in software development. In addition to all of these, it is quite common in these embedded systems for components to have multiple implementations that must run on disparate processing elements. With all of this taken into account, it stands to reason that these systems could and should benefit greatly from advances in software technology such as product line engineering, domain-specific modeling and model-driven engineering. It is our experience that one big benefit to the software development industry is the combination of the Software Product Lines and Model Driven Engineering technologies.},

abstract = {In product line engineering individual products are derived from the domain artifacts of the product line. The reuse of the domain artifacts is constraint by the product line variability. Since domain artifacts are reused in several products, product line engineering benefits from the verification of domain artifacts. For verifying development artifacts, model checking is a well-established technique in single system development. However, existing model checking approaches do not incorporate the product line variability and are hence of limited use for verifying domain artifacts. In this paper we present an extended model checking approach which takes the product line variability into account when verifying domain artifacts. Our approach is thus able to verify that every permissible product (specified with I/O-automata) which can be derived from the product line fulfills the specified properties (specified with CTL). Moreover, we use two examples to validate the applicability of our approach and report on the preliminary validation results.},

abstract = {Component reuse is a crucial remanufacturing strategy that assists manufacturers to achieve sustainable supply chain management. However, few manufacturers obtain economic benefits from component reuse strategies due to the demand for increasing product variety and its related complex cost structure. In this paper, we propose an integrated quantitative decision model to assess the economic aspects of component reuse for remanufacturing management. Given numerous cost factors, such as component manufacturing, reverse logistics, reprocessing, disposal and penalty costs, we derive the optimal acquisition cost to retrieve end-of-life products for component reuse. Then, we identify the component commonality effects to quantify the component reuse rate from a variety of end-of-life products. Finally, our models and results are demonstrated through an industrial case study. Accordingly, the cost savings from reusing components could be achieved by 25&nbsp;% of the manufacturing cost offered to acquire the used products from customers at a low reverse logistics cost. Based on the 80&nbsp;% yield rate observed in the case study, the commonality of components in a product family would affect 35&nbsp;% of the total cost savings of component reuse for remanufacturing.},

abstract = {A feature model represents a set of variants as configurable features and dependencies between them. During variant configuration, (de)selection of a feature may entail that other features must or cannot be selected. A Modal Implication Graph (MIG) enables efficient decision propagation to perform automatic (de)selection of subsequent features. In addition, it facilitates other configuration-related activities such as t-wise sampling. Evolution of a feature model may change its configuration logic, thereby invalidating an existing MIG and forcing a full recomputation. However, repeated recomputation of a MIG is expensive, and thus hampers the overall usefulness of MIGs for frequently evolving feature models. In this paper, we devise a method to incrementally compute updated MIGs after feature model evolution. We identify expensive steps in the MIG construction algorithm, enable them for incremental computation, and measure performance compared to a full rebuild of a complete MIG within the evolution histories of four real-world feature models. Results show that our incremental method can increase the speed of MIG construction by orders of magnitude, depending on the given scenario and extent of evolutionary changes.},

There is a need for a universal variability management approach to be consistent and scalable; it should provide traceability between variations at different levels of abstraction and across various generic development artifacts; and there should be a means for visualizing variability. Focusing specifically on the aspect of traceability in the context of such an approach, we define a conceptual variability model that captures variability information in a third dimension, and allows a 1-to-1 mapping of variability between the problem space and the solution space. Decision models, of which the feature model is most popular, are commonly used for, amongst others, managing traceability of variation. These, however, usually reside in a two dimensional space. We analyze the feature model in a small case study with regards to our conceptual variability model, and present our findings.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is nowadays one of the most promising IT technologies, since it provides seemingly unlimited resources on demand at low costs. Hence, different types of applications have been migrated to IaaS environments, e.g. multi-tier (distributed) applications. However, in order to benefit from such characteristics, cloud configurations (i.e. virtual resource configurations) should be designed accordingly to the necessities of the applications. Furthermore, such configurations have to provide the required resources not only at the application deployment-time, but also during the whole application execution time. Hence, adaptive paradigms are required when designing solutions to cloud applications with dynamic resource requirements. Software Product Lines (SPLs) provide great flexibility and a high level of abstraction to describe complete system configurations. Even though SPLs are not commonly used to describe changes after an initial product (configuration) has been created, their inherent characteristics can enable producing the required virtual resource configuration to adapt applications after their initial deployment, i.e., at runtime. In this paper, we present an approach to create and adapt cloud configurations at the IaaS level by using SPLs. We focus on the architectural design of our solution as well as on the possible implementation challenges we could face.},

Neither domain engineering nor requirements engineering handles such co-evolution of requirements and contexts explicitly, making it especially hard to reason about the impact of co-changes in complex scenarios. Objective: In this paper, we propose a problem-oriented and value-based analysis method for variability evolution analysis. The method takes into account both kinds of changes (requirements and contexts) during the life of an evolving software product line. Method: The proposed method extends the core requirements engineering ontology with the notions to represent variability-intensive problem decomposition and evolution. On the basis of problemorientation, the analysis method identifies candidate changes, detects influenced features, and evaluates their contributions to the value of the SPL. Results and Conclusion: The process of applying the analysis method is illustrated using a concrete case study of an evolving enterprise software system, which has confirmed that tracing back to requirements and contextual changes is an effective way to understand the evolution of variability in the software product line.},

As engineering, management and validation of SPLs is far from trivial, special solutions for software product line engineering (SPLE) have a continuous momentum in both academic and industry. In general, it is hard to judge when to reasonably favor SPLE over alternative solutions that are more common in the industry. In this paper, we illustrate how we as Elinvar manage variability within our WealthTech Platform as a Service (PaaS) at different granularity levels, and discuss methods for SPLE in this context. More in detail, we share our techniques and concepts to address configuration management, and show how we manage a single microservice SPL including inter-service communication. Finally, we provide insights into platform solutions by means of packages for our clients. We end with a discussion on SPLE techniques in context of service SPLs and our packaging strategy. We conclude that while we are good to go with industry-standard approaches for microservice SPLs, the variability modeling and analysis advantages within SPLE is promising for our packaging strategy.},

The underlying idea is to retest only some of the products that conform to the software product line architecture and to infer, using assume-guarantee reasoning, the correctness of the other products. Assume-guarantee reasoning moreover permits the retesting of only those components that are affected by the changes.},

Our PLiC approach resembles the fact that, in practice, the domain of a large product line is divided into sub-domains. A PLiC (product line component) packages all results (configuration, generation, and implementation assets) of a sub-domain and offers interfaces for configuration and generation. With our approach we tackle the challenges of using multiple and different types of configuration models and text files, give support for automated product generation, and integrate feature modeling to support application engineering as an extensive development task.},

Specifically, to make an architecture design, presented practices include: understanding relevant domains, requirements engineering, architecture definition. The strengths and weaknesses of Face book architecture are evaluated with the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM). As a result of applying a framework for SPL practice, layered view and component-based view are illustrated along with variabilities represented by Product Line UML-based Software Engineering (PLUS) and Orthogonal Variability Model (OVM). Based on the analysis of requirements of SNS, additional services such as file sharing and instant messaging are represented as optional components. In case of Face book, three key quality attributes, i.e., availability, scalability, and privacy are analyzed by using quality attribute utility tree. We identified that Face book employs client-server architecture. Through ATAM, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) approach promoting privacy is explained.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineers put a lot of effort to ensure that, through the setting of a large number of possible configuration options, products are acceptable and well-tailored to customers' needs. Unfortunately, options and their mutual interactions create a huge configuration space which is intractable to exhaustively explore. Instead of testing all products, machine learning is increasingly employed to approximate the set of acceptable products out of a small training sample of configurations. Machine learning (ML) techniques can refine a software product line through learned constraints and a priori prevent non-acceptable products to be derived. In this paper, we use adversarial ML techniques to generate adversarial configurations fooling ML classifiers and pinpoint incorrect classifications of products (videos) derived from an industrial video generator. Our attacks yield (up to) a 100% misclassification rate and a drop in accuracy of 5%. We discuss the implications these results have on SPL quality assurance.},

abstract = {Quality attributes that add new behavior to the functional software architecture are known as functional quality attributes (FQAs). These FQAs are applied to pieces of software from small components to entire systems, usually crosscutting some of them. Due to this crosscutting nature, modeling them separately from the base application has many advantages (e.g. reusability, less coupled architectures). However, different applications may require different configurations of an FQA (e.g. different levels of security), so we need a language that: (i) easily expresses the variability of the FQAs at the architectural level; and that (ii) also facilitates the automatic generation of architectural configurations with custom-made FQAs. In this sense, the Common Variability Language (CVL) is extremely suited for use at the architectural level, not requiring the use of a particular architectural language to model base functional requirements. In this paper we propose a method based on CVL to: (i) model separately and generate FQAs customized to the application requirements; (ii) automatically inject customized FQA components into the architecture of the applications. We quantitatively evaluate our approach and discuss its benefits with a case study.},

Even though most of the tools focus on architecture and usability they don't take into account the end user background. For instance some end users are domain experts, experienced software developers, and others have very limited computer skills. Furthermore current EUD approaches do not address reuse. In this paper we present XANA, an EUD framework that extends existing EUD tools with Software Product Line (SPL) concepts. The framework targets two types of users: the application designers and the end users. Application designers create the SPL for end users. End users select SPL features and derive applications for their smart spaces. XANA promotes reuse by allowing end users to reuse features and components to create applications. We illustrate its use with examples in a smart home setting.},

COPLIMO is an economic model that relies on COCOMO II to estimate the benefits of adopting a product line approach compared to developing the products one by one. Although COPLIMO is an ideal economic model to support decision making on the incremental development of a product line, it makes some simplifying assumptions that may produce high distortions in the estimates (e.g., COPLIMO takes for granted that all the products have the same size). This paper proposes a COPLIMO reformulation that avoids such assumptions and, consequently, improves the accuracy of the estimates. To support our proposal, we present an algorithm that infers the additional information that our COPLIMO reformulation requires from feature diagrams, which is a widespread notation to model the domain of a product line.},

The results of the analysis show that the core and application modules of the CFS are unit tested in isolation using a stub framework developed by the CFS team. The application developers can unit test their code without waiting for the core modules to be completed, and vice versa. The analysis found that this unit testing approach incorporates many practical and useful solutions such as allowing for unit testing without requiring hardware and special OS features in-the-loop by defining stub implementations of dependent modules. These solutions are worth considering when deciding how to design the testing architecture for a SPL.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is a paradigm that advocates the reusability of software engineering assets and the rapid development of new applications for a target domain. These objectives are achieved by capturing the commonalities and variabilities between the applications of the target domain and through the development of comprehensive and variability-covering feature models. The feature models developed within the software product line development process need to cover the relevant features and aspects of the target domain. In other words, the feature models should be elaborate representations of the feature space of that domain. Given that feature models, i.e., software product line feature models, are developed mostly by domain analysts by sifting through domain documentation, corporate records and transcribed interviews, the process is a cumbersome and error-prone one. In this paper, we propose a decision support platform that assists domain analysts throughout the domain engineering lifecycle by: (1) automatically performing natural language processing tasks over domain documents and identifying important information for the domain analysts such as the features and integrity constraints that exist in the domain documents; (2) providing a collaboration platform around the domain documents such that multiple domain analysts can collaborate with each other during the process using a Wiki; (3) formulating semantic links between domain terminology with external widely used ontologies such as WordNet in order to disambiguate the terms used in domain documents; and (4) developing traceability links between the unstructured information available in the domain documents and their formal counterparts within the formal feature model representations. Results obtained from our controlled experimentations show that the decision support platform is effective in increasing the performance of the domain analysts during the domain engineering lifecycle in terms of both the coverage and accuracy measures.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the software industry is faced with challenges regarding complexity, time to market, quality standards and evolution. To face those challenges, two strategies that are gaining interest both in academy and industry are Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Software Product Lines (SPL). While SOA aims at building applications from an orchestration of services, SPL consists in building a set of core-assets and a derivation strategy based on such assets. Adopting such approaches involves important challenges with regard to existing software artifacts that must be transformed in order to respect an architecture that focus on modularity and reuse. This paper presents an industrial experience of such transformation. We propose a non-intrusive reverse engineering process for the development of modular services obtained automatically from existing software artifacts, and a variability-driven derivation process to assembly products out of such services. To validate our approach, we have implemented the reverse engineering and derivation processes using real software JEE artifacts from a component framework of reusable functionalities in several different enterprise applications. The results show important benefits in terms of the development time and flexibility.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is about producing a set of similar products in a certain domain. A variability model documents the variability amongst products in a product line. The specification of variability can be extended with quality information, such as measurable quality attributes (e.g., CPU and memory consumption) and constraints on these attributes (e.g., memory consumption should be in a range of values). However, the wrong use of constraints may cause anomalies in the specification which must be detected (e.g., the model could represent no products). Furthermore, based on such quality information, it is possible to carry out quality-aware analyses, i.e., the product line engineer may want to verify whether it is possible to build a product that satisfies a desired quality. The challenge for quality-aware specification and analysis is threefold. First, there should be a way to specify quality information in variability models. Second, it should be possible to detect anomalies in the variability specification associated with quality information. Third, there should be mechanisms to verify the variability model to extract useful information, such as the possibility to build a product that fulfils certain quality conditions (e.g., is there any product that requires less than 512 MB of memory?). In this article, we present an approach for quality-aware analysis in software product lines using the orthogonal variability model (OVM) to represent variability. We propose to map variability represented in the OVM associated with quality information to a constraint satisfaction problem and to use an off-the-shelf constraint programming solver to automatically perform the verification task. To illustrate our approach, we use a product line in the automotive domain which is an example that was created in a national project by a leading car company. We have developed a prototype tool named FaMa-OVM, which works as a proof of concepts. We were able to identify void models, dead and false optional elements, and check whether the product line example satisfies quality conditions.},

This paper investigates the issue of nonfunctional requirement tradeoff analysis for software product lines at the architecture design stage, and proposes an architectural approach to assist architects in making optimal revision decisions based on nonfunctional tradeoff analysis results. In particular, the nonfunctional requirement supported in the approach at this stage is performance. The little's law has been adopted to support performance analysis for software product line architecture design. A Unified Modeling Language profile is also developed to support performance modeling for software product line architecture design, thus to facilitate architectural performance analysis.},

Customers are often interested not only in particular functionalities (i.e., features), but also in non-functional quality attributes, such as performance, reliability, and footprint. Measuring quality attributes of all products of a product line usually does not scale. In this research-in-progress report, we propose a systematic approach aiming at efficient and scalable prediction of quality attributes of products. To this end, we establish predictors for certain categories of quality attributes (e.g., a predictor for high memory consumption) based on software and network measures, and receiver operating characteristic analysis. We use these predictors to guide a sampling process that takes the assets of a product line as input and determines the products that fall into the category denoted by the given predictor (e.g., products with high memory consumption). We propose to use predictors to make the process of finding "acceptable" products more efficient. We discuss and compare several strategies to incorporate predictors in the sampling process.},

Additionally, software systems evolve over time in order to adjust to unanticipated changes in their application environment. In modern software development, software architecture modeling is an important means to deal with system complexity by architectural decomposition. This leads to the need of architectural description languages that can represent spatial and temporal variability. In this paper, we present delta modeling of software architectures as a uniform modeling formalism for architectural variability in space and in time. In order to avoid degeneration of the product line model under system evolution, we present refactoring techniques to maintain and improve the quality of the variability model. Using a running example from the automotive domain, we evaluate our approach by carrying out a case study that compares delta modeling with annotative variability modeling.},

In a changing world, modern software demands more and more adaptive features, many of them performed dynamically, and the requirements on the software architecture to support adaptation capabilities of systems are increasing in importance. Today, many embedded system families and application domains such as ecosystems, service-based applications, and self-adaptive systems demand runtime capabilities for flexible adaptation, reconfiguration, and post-deployment activities. However, as traditional software product line architectures fail to provide mechanisms for runtime adaptation and behavior of products, there is a shift toward designing more dynamic software architectures and building more adaptable software able to handle autonomous decision-making, according to varying conditions. Recent development approaches such as Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) attempt to face the challenges of the dynamic conditions of such systems but the state of these solution architectures is still immature. In order to provide a more comprehensive treatment of DSPL models and their solution architectures, in this research work we provide an overview of the state of the art and current techniques that, partially, attempt to face the many challenges of runtime variability mechanisms in the context of Dynamic Software Product Lines. We also provide an integrated view of the challenges and solutions that are necessary to support runtime variability mechanisms in DSPL models and software architectures.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) usually involves a shared set of core assets and a series of application products. To ensure consistency, the evolution of the core assets and all the application products should be coordinated and synchronized under a unified evolution process. Therefore, SPL evolution often involves cross-product propagation and synchronization besides application derivation based on core assets, presenting quite different characteristic from the evolution of individual software products. As software architectures, including the product line architecture (PLA) and application architectures, play a central role in SPL engineering and evolution, architecture-based evolution analysis is a natural way for analyzing and managing SPL evolution. In this paper, we explore common practices of architecture evolution and the rationale behind in industrial SPL development. To this end, we conduct a case study with Wingsoft examination system product line (WES-PL), an industrial product line with an evolution history of eight years and more than 10 application products. In the case study, we reviewed the evolution history of WES-PL architecture and analyzed several typical evolution cases. Based on the historical analysis, we identify some special problems in industrial SPL practice from the aspect of architecture evolution and summarize some useful experiences about SPL evolution decisions to complement classical SPL methodology. On the other hand, we also propose some possible improvements for the evolution management in WES-PL.},

abstract = {Software product lines rely on developing reusable artifacts and defining their variability in models to support and accelerate the derivation of individual products. A major challenge in product lines is the continuous evolution of both the reusable artifacts and derived products. Products that have been derived from a product line have to be updated regularly, e.g., after bugfixes or the development of new features. Changes to reusable artifacts and variability models have to be propagated to derived products. The aim of our research is to provide automated support for the evolution of products derived from product lines by capturing and replaying configuration decisions. Our PUPLE (Product Updates in Product Line Engineering) approach supports updating derived products after changes to the product line they have been derived from. It exploits the structure of variability models and uses change-tracking data to minimize user intervention. The paper first explores how different types of product line changes influence the derived products. It then presents extensions to our decision-oriented product line approach DOPLER to support product line evolution. We evaluate the feasibility of the PUPLE approach with evolution tasks that were performed by engineers of an industry partner on a product line of an Eclipse-based tool suite with six derived products. We conclude with lessons learned and limitations of our approach.},

abstract = {Reliability is important to software product-line developers since many product lines require reliable operation. It is typically assumed that as a software product line matures, its reliability improves. Since post-deployment failures impact reliability, we study this claim on an open-source software product line, Eclipse. We investigate the failure trend of common components (reused across all products), highreuse variation components (reused in five or six products) and low-reuse variation components (reused in one or two products) as Eclipse evolves. We also study how much the common and variation components change over time both in terms of addition of new files and modification of existing files. Quantitative results from mining and analysis of the Eclipse bug and release repositories show that as the product line evolves, fewer serious failures occur in components implementing commonality, and that these components also exhibit less change over time. These results were roughly as expected. However, contrary to expectation, components implementing variations, even when reused in five or more products, continue to evolve fairly rapidly. Perhaps as a result, the number of severe failures in variation components shows no uniform pattern of decrease over time. The paper describes and discusses this and related results.},

However, migrating existing, customised product copies to a product line is still an open issue due to the required comprehension of differences among products and SPL design decisions. Most existing SPL approaches are focused on forward engineering. Only few aim to handle SPL evolution, but even those lack support of variability reverse engineering, which is necessary for migrating product copies to a product line. In this paper, we present how component architecture information can be used to enhance a variabilty reverse engineering process to target this challenge and show the relevance of component architecture in the individual requirements on the resulting SPL.

abstract = {Product lines are often employed for the facilitation of software re-use, rapid application development and increase in productivity. Despite the numerous advantages of software product lines, the task of testing them is a cumbersome process due to the fact that the number of applications that need to be tested is exponential to the number of features represented in the product line. In this paper, we attempt to reduce the number of required tests for testing a software product line while at the same time preserving an acceptable fault coverage. For this purpose, we introduce eight coverage criteria based on the transformation of software product line feature models into formal context-free grammars. The theoretical foundation for the proposed coverage criteria is based on the development of equivalence partitions on the software product line configuration space and the use of boundary value analysis for test suite generation. We have performed experiments on several SPLOT feature models, the results of which show that the test suite generation strategies based on the proposed coverage criteria are effective in significantly reducing the number of required tests and at the same time maintaining a high fault coverage ratio.},

abstract = {Model-based product line engineering applies the reuse practices from product line engineering with graphical modeling for the specification of software intensive systems. Variability is usually described in separate variability models, while the implementation of the variable systems is specified in system models that use modeling languages such as SysML. Most of the SysML modeling tools with variability support, implement the annotation-based modeling approach. Annotated product line models tend to be error-prone since the modeler implicitly describes every possible variant in a single system model. To identifying variability-related inconsistencies, in this paper, we firstly define restrictions on the use of SysML for annotative modeling in order to avoid situations where resulting instances of the annotated model may contain ambiguous model constructs. Secondly, inter-feature constraints are extracted from the annotated model, based on relations between elements that are annotated with features. By analyzing the constraints, we can identify if the combined variability- and system model can result in incorrect or ambiguous instances. The evaluation of our prototype implementation shows the potential of our approach by identifying inconsistencies in the product line model of our industrial partner which went undetected through several iterations of the model.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) seek to achieve gains in productivity and time to market. Many companies in several domains are constantly adopting SPLs. Dealing with SPLs begin after companies find themselves with successful variants of a product in a particular domain. The adoption of an SPL-based approach in the automotive industry may provide a significant return on investment. To switch to an SPL-based approach, practitioners lack a reengineering approach that supports SPL migration and evolution in a systematic fashion.This paper presents a practical evolution-based approach to migrate and evolve a set of variants of a given product into an SPL and describes a case study from the automotive domain. The case study considers the need to handle the classical sensor variants family (CSVF) at Bosch Company.Using this study, we performed a contributed step toward future switch of the CSVF into the SPL. We investigated the applicability of the proposed evolution-based approach with a real variants family (using the textual requirements of the CSVF) and we evaluated our approach using several data collection methods. The results reveal that our approach can be suitable for the automotive domain in the case study.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) engineering is a software engineering paradigm that exploits the commonality between similar software products to reduce life cycle costs and time-to-market. Many SPLs are critical and would benefit from efficient verification through model checking. Model checking SPLs is more difficult than for single systems, since the number of different products is potentially huge. In previous work, we introduced Featured Transition Systems (FTS), a formal, compact representation of SPL behaviour, and provided efficient algorithms to verify FTS. Yet, we still face the state explosion problem, like any model checking-based verification. Model abstraction is the most relevant answer to state explosion. In this paper, we define a novel simulation relation for FTS and provide an algorithm to compute it. We extend well-known simulation preservation properties to FTS and thus lay the theoretical foundations for abstraction-based model checking of SPLs. We evaluate our approach by comparing the cost of FTS-based simulation and abstraction with respect to product-by-product methods. Our results show that FTS are a solid foundation for simulation-based model checking of SPL.},

abstract = {ContextPrevious work by researchers on 3years of early data for an Eclipse product has identified some predictors of failure-prone files that work well. Eclipse has also been used previously by researchers to study characteristics of product line software. ObjectiveThe work reported here investigates whether classification-based prediction of failure-prone files improves as the product line evolves. MethodThis investigation first repeats, to the extent possible, the previous study and then extends it by including four more recent years of data, comparing the prominent predictors with the previous results. The research then looks at the data for three additional Eclipse products as they evolve over time. The analysis compares results from three different types of datasets with alternative data collection and prediction periods. ResultsOur experiments with a variety of learners show that the difference between the performance of J48, used in this work, and the other top learners is not statistically significant. Furthermore, new results show that the effectiveness of classification significantly depends on the data collection period and prediction period. The study identifies change metrics that are prominent predictors across all four releases of all four products in the product line for the three different types of datasets. From the product line perspective, prediction of failure-prone files for the four products studied in the Eclipse product line shows statistically significant improvement in accuracy but not in recall across releases. ConclusionAs the product line matures, the learner performance improves significantly for two of the three datasets, but not for prediction of post-release failure-prone files using only pre-release change data. This suggests that it may be difficult to detect failure-prone files in the evolving product line. At least in part, this may be due to the continuous change, even for commonalities and high-reuse variation components, which we previously have shown to exist.},

abstract = {The recent trend of switching from single software product development to lines of software products in the software industry has made the software product line concept viable. As a result of its popularity, a methodology is required for the process assessment of software product lines. Although researchers and practitioners understand that current software process assessment approaches cannot be directly applied to assess the software product line process, apart from some initial conceptual work, no direct methodology has yet been proposed. The primary purpose of this research is to study the software product line process and to put forward a Process Maturity Model for Software Product Line in order to fill the research gap of a process maturity assessment methodology. The maturity models for business, organization, and architecture are proposed in this research so as to cover the three essential dimensions of the software product line process. Three separate empirical investigations are conducted to determine certain key factors that contribute to and have an impact on the performance of the business, organization, and architecture dimensions of the software product line. The methodology to evaluate an organization's maturity profile once the assessment results of the individual dimensions like business, architecture, process, and organization are evident is also an integral feature of this  Process Maturity Model for Software Product Line. This work further contributes to defining the overall maturity level scales for the software product line process. The Process Maturity Model for Software Product Line will assist organizations in carrying out process assessment of the software product line in order to determine the capability of the organization to define, manage, and control the software product line process.

abstract = {Software companies need to provide a large set of features satisfying functional and non-functional requirements of diverse customers, thereby leading to variability in space. Feature location techniques have been proposed to support software maintenance and evolution in space. However, so far only one feature location technique also analyses the evolution in time of system variants, which is required for feature enhancements and bug fixing. Specifically, existing tools for managing a set of systems over time do not offer proper support for keeping track of feature revisions, updating existing variants, and creating new product configurations based on feature revisions. This paper presents four challenges concerning such capabilities for feature (revision) location and composition of new product configurations based on feature/s (revisions). We also provide a benchmark containing a ground truth and support for computing metrics. We hope that this will motivate researchers to provide and evaluate tool-supported approaches aiming at managing systems evolving in space and time. Further, we do not limit the evaluation of techniques to only this benchmark: we introduce and provide instructions on how to use a benchmark extractor for generating ground truth data for other systems. We expect that the feature (revision) location techniques maximize information retrieval in terms of precision, recall, and F-score, while keeping execution time and memory consumption low.},

abstract = {One expected characteristic in modern systems is self-adaptation, the capability of monitoring and reacting to changes into the environment. A particular case of self-adaptation is affective-driven self-adaptation. Affective-driven self-adaptation is about having consciousness of user’s affects (emotions) and drive self-adaptation reacting to changes in those affects. Most of the previous work around self-adaptive systems deals with performance, resources, and error recovery as variables that trigger a system reaction. Moreover, most effort around affect recognition has been put towards offline analysis of affect, and to date only few applications exist that are able to infer user’s affect in real-time and trigger self-adaptation mechanisms. In response to this deficit, this work proposes a software product line approach to jump-start the development of affect-driven self-adaptive systems by offering the definition of a domain-specific architecture, a set of components (organized as a framework), and guidelines to tailor those components. Study cases with systems for learning and gaming will confirm the capability of the software product line to provide desired functionalities and qualities.},

abstract = {Context: Variability is the ability of a software artifact (e.g., a system, component) to be adapted for a specific context, in a preplanned manner. Variability not only affects functionality, but also quality attributes (e.g., security, performance). Service-based software systems consider variability in functionality implicitly by dynamic service composition. However, variability in quality attributes of service-based systems seems insufficiently addressed in current design practices. Objective: We aim at (a) assessing methods for handling variability in quality attributes of service-based systems, (b) collecting evidence about current research that suggests implications for practice, and (c) identifying open problems and areas for improvement. Method: A systematic literature review with an automated search was conducted. The review included studies published between the year 2000 and 2011. We identified 46 relevant studies. Results: Current methods focus on a few quality attributes, in particular performance and availability. Also, most methods use formal techniques. Furthermore, current studies do not provide enough evidence for practitioners to adopt proposed approaches. So far, variability in quality attributes has mainly been studied in laboratory settings rather than in industrial environments. Conclusions: The product line domain as the domain that traditionally deals with variability has only little impact on handling variability in quality attributes. The lack of tool support, the lack of practical research and evidence for the applicability of approaches to handle variability are obstacles for practitioners to adopt methods. Therefore, we suggest studies in industry (e.g., surveys) to collect data on how practitioners handle variability of quality attributes in service-based systems. For example, results of our study help formulate hypotheses and questions for such surveys. Based on needs in practice, new approaches can be proposed.},

Although several solutions have been proposed for this type of application, reuse is not systematically used throughout the software development lifecycle. Then, in this paper we propose an approach for the development of a mobile and context-aware Software Product Line (SPL). A SPL for the mobile and context-ware mobile guide domain is presented in order to illustrate the steps of the proposed approach. Furthermore, the lessons learned in the SPL development are discussed. Both approach and SPL are the main contributions of this paper.},

abstract = {Feature location is a traceability recovery activity to identify the implementation elements associated to a characteristic of a system. Besides its relevance for software maintenance of a single system, feature location in a collection of systems received a lot of attention as a first step to re-engineer system variants (created through clone-and-own) into a Software Product Line (SPL). In this context, the objective is to unambiguously identify the boundaries of a feature inside a family of systems to later create reusable assets from these implementation elements. Among all the case studies in the SPL literature, variants derived from ArgoUML SPL stands out as the most used one. However, the use of different settings, or the omission of relevant information (e.g., the exact configurations of the variants or the way the metrics are calculated), makes it difficult to reproduce or benchmark the different feature location techniques even if the same ArgoUML SPL is used. With the objective to foster the research area on feature location, we provide a set of common scenarios using ArgoUML SPL and a set of utils to obtain metrics based on the results of existing and novel feature location techniques.},

abstract = {The quality attributes of a system are determined, to a large extend, by the decisions taken early on in the development process, noticeably affecting the specification of its software architecture. This is especially true for attributes such as security, usability, context awareness, etc., that have strong functional implications -- i.e. they require the incorporation of Specific functionality to the application architecture in order to satisfy them. Our approach models functional quality attributes considering that: (1) they are complex enough so as to be modeled by a large set of related concerns and the compositions among them. For instance, security includes authentication, access control, privacy, encryption, auditing, etc; (2) the same quality attributes are required by several applications, and thus should be modeled as separate, ready-to-use (re)usable architectural solutions that final applications can incorporate without "being previously prepared" for it; and (3) not all the concerns that are part of a quality attribute need to be instantiated for a particular application (e.g. only the authentication and access control concerns of security are required). In order to consider all the above requirements, in this paper we present a software product line approach that permits modeling the variability of quality attributes using feature models, and generating different configurations of their software architecture depending on the particular concerns required by each application.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a family of related programs of a domain. The programs of an SPL are distinguished in terms of features, which are end-user visible characteristics of programs. Based on a selection of features, stakeholders can derive tailor-made programs that satisfy functional requirements. Besides functional requirements, different application scenarios raise the need for optimizing non-functional properties of a variant. The diversity of application scenarios leads to heterogeneous optimization goals with respect to non-functional properties (e.g., performance vs. footprint vs. energy optimized variants). Hence, an SPL has to satisfy different and sometimes contradicting requirements regarding non-functional properties. Usually, the actually required non-functional properties are not known before product derivation and can vary for each application scenario and customer. Allowing stakeholders to derive optimized variants requires us to measure non-functional properties after the SPL is developed. Unfortunately, the high variability provided by SPLs complicates measurement and optimization of non-functional properties due to a large variant space. With SPL Conqueror, we provide a holistic approach to optimize non-functional properties in SPL engineering. We show how non-functional properties can be qualitatively specified and quantitatively measured in the context of SPLs. Furthermore, we discuss the variant-derivation process in SPL Conqueror that reduces the effort of computing an optimal variant. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by means of nine case studies of a broad range of application domains (e.g., database management and operating systems). Moreover, we show that SPL Conqueror is implementation and language independent by using SPLs that are implemented with different mechanisms, such as conditional compilation and feature-oriented programming.},

abstract = {Display Omitted Integrated product family and closed-loop supply chain design.A cooperative negotiation embedded NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization problems is proposed.Effect analysis of environmental penalty, quantity of demand and marginal cost of remanufacturing. Product family design is a popular approach adopted by manufacturers to increase their product varieties in order to satisfy the needs of various markets. In recent years, because of increasing environmental concerns in societies and strict regulations of environmental protection, quite a number of manufacturers adopted remanufacturing strategy in their product development in response to the challenges. Remanufacturing of used products unavoidably involves a closed-loop supply chain system. To achieve the best outcomes, the supply chain design should be considered in product family design process. In this research, a multi-objective optimization model of integrated product family and closed loop supply chain design is formulated based on a cooperative game model for minimizing manufacturers total cost and maximize suppliers total payoffs. Since the optimization problem could be a large- scale one and involves mixed continuous-discrete variables, a new version of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), namely cooperative negotiation embedded NSGA-II (NSGA-CO), is proposed to solve the optimization model. Simulation tests are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed NSGA-CO. The test results indicate that the proposed NSGA-CO outperforms NSGA-II in solving various scale of multi-objective optimization problems in terms of convergence. With the formulated optimization model and the proposed NSGA-CO, a case study of integrated product family and supply chain design is conducted to investigate the effects of environmental penalty, quantity of demand and marginal cost of remanufacturing on used product return rate, manufacturers and suppliers profits and joint payoff.},

abstract = {The Product-Line Architecture (PLA) is a fundamental SPL artifact. However, PLA design is a people-intensive and non-trivial task, and to find the best architecture can be formulated as an optimization problem with many objectives. We found several approaches that address search-based design of software architectures by using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. However, such approaches have not been applied to PLAs. Considering such fact, in this work, we explore the use of these approaches to optimize PLAs. An extension of existing approaches is investigated, which uses specific metrics to evaluate the PLA characteristics. Then, we performed a case study involving one SPL. From the experience acquired during this study, we can relate some lessons learned, which are discussed in this work. Furthermore, the results point out that, in the case of PLAs, it is necessary to use SPL specific measures and evolutionary operators more sensitive to the SPL context.},

abstract = {The capability of product family design meets new requirements of customer-driven market nowadays. In order to improve the market competence, enterprises need design a certain product family with better quality, lower cost and less time spending as its best, while these three optimal goals are contradictory in most instances. In this paper, a novel multi-objective collaborative optimization algorithm, Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm with Hill Climbing algorithm (NSGA-HC), is proposed for product family design, which can trade off local bias of the single-factor algorithm. Secondly, in terms of a better product family designing scheme, a Cycle Subsystem Model with Features is structured, which not only considers product features as an essential factor influencing product performance but also regards each subsystem as individual for product family design. In addition, an industrial field example is demonstrated as a multi-objective optimal problem to validate the proposed model and algorithm. Finally, an experimental comparison shows that this novel algorithm has higher efficiency and avoids local extremum.},

abstract = {A microservice implements a small unit of functionality that it provides through a network using lightweight protocols. So, microservices can be combined to fulfill tasks and implement features of a larger software system---resembling a variability mechanism in the context of a software product line (SPL). Microservices and SPLs have similar goals, namely facilitating reuse and customizing, but they are usually employed in different contexts. Any developer who has access to the network can provide a microservice for any task, while SPLs are usually intended to implement features of a specific domain. Due to their different concepts, using microservices to implement an SPL or adopting SPL practices (e.g., variability management) for microservices is a challenging cross-area research problem. However, both techniques can complement each other, and thus tackling this problem promises benefits for organizations that employ either technique. In this paper, we reason on the importance of advancing in this direction, and sketch six concrete challenges to initiate research, namely (1) feature identification, (2) variability modeling, (3) variable microservice architectures, (4) interchangeability, (5) deep customization, and (6) re-engineering an SPL. We intend these challenges to serve as a starting point for future research in this cross-area research direction---avoiding that the concepts of one area are reinvented in the other.},

abstract = {We propose to integrate performance analysis in the early phases of the model-driven development process for Software Product Lines (SPL). We start with a multi-view UML model of the core family assets representing the commonality and variability between different products, which we call the SPL model. We add another perspective to the SPL model, annotating it with generic performance specifications expressed in the standard UML profile MARTE, recently adopted by OMG. The runtime performance of a product is affected by factors contained in the UML model of the product (derived from the SPL model), but also by external factors depending on the implementation and execution environments. The external factors not contained in the SPL model need to be eventually represented in the performance model. In order to do so, we propose to represent the variability space of different possible implementation and execution environments through a so called "performance completion (PC) feature model". These PC features are mapped to MARTE performance-related stereotypes and attributes attached to the SPL model elements. A first model transformation realized in the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL) derives the UML model of a specific product with concrete MARTE annotations from the SPL model. A second transformation generates a Layered Queueing Network (LQN) performance model for the given product by applying an existing transformation named PUMA, developed in previous work. The proposed technique is illustrated with an e-commerce case study. A LQN model is derived for a product and the impact of different levels of secure communication channels on its performance is analyzed by using the LQN model.},

They aim at handling the commonality and variability of these products. SPLs reduce the development cost, time-to-market, and increase overall quality of the product variants.But Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) can find the development of an SPL to be expensive and challenging, especially the process regarding the domain engineering. They can be forced to hire or train dedicated SPL-experts to work on the SPL development. This extra cost can be a significant obstacle toward the adoption of this technology by these enterprises.In this paper we present our work on an new approach to reduce and facilitate the adoption of the SPL techniques in SMEs. The goal of this approach is to automatically and incrementally build SPLs. This is based on an original combination of existing extractive and reactive approaches.We advocate the need for new solutions to facilitate the adoption of SPL technology by SMEs. We discuss a global solution based on an original combination of the existing extractive and reactive approaches. Our solution is a new approach that automatically and incrementally build SPLs. We present our global solution under the form of five research questions, of which we discuss the motivations and the methodologies.

abstract = {Self-adaptive systems have recently been receiving much attention because of their ability to cope with the changes of environment, failures, and unanticipated events. These systems need an adaptation mechanism, which automatically computes the possible configurations, and decides the most appropriate configuration to fit the environment. In particular, the satisfaction of non-functional requirements must be considered when selecting the best reconfiguration. However, there are trade-off problems among non-functional requirements. Moreover, the adaptation mechanisms are typically developed separately from the components to be implemented, and it complicates the construction of such systems. We propose (1) a feature-oriented analysis technique, which can identify adaptation points, and calculate the contribution to non-functional goals of the configuration; (2) a component specification model, which extends an architectural description language for self-adaptation; (3) a reconfiguration framework aimed to reduce the complexity of the reconfiguration and generate the best configuration at run-time. We evaluate the feasibility of our framework by four different scenarios, and show that our framework reduces the complexity of the reconfiguration, and solves the trade-off problem among non-functional requirements.},

abstract = {When variability is implemented into a single variability-rich system with object-oriented techniques (e.g., inheritance, overloading, design patterns), the variation points and variants usually do not align with the domain features. It is then very hard and time consuming to manually identify these variation points to manage variability at the implementation level. symfinder is a toolchain to automatically identify and visualize these variability implementation locations inside a single object-oriented code base. For the identification part, it relies on the notion of symmetry between classes or methods to characterize uniformly some implementation techniques such as inheritance, overloading, or design patterns like Factory. The toolchain also generates an interactive Web-based visualization in which classes that are variation points are nodes linked together through their inheritance relationships, while the size, color, and texture of the nodes are used to represent some metrics on the number of overloaded constructors or methods. As a result, the visualization enables one to discern zones of interest where variation points are strongly present and to get relevant information over concerned classes. The toolchain, publicly available with its source code and an online demo, has been applied to several large open source projects.},

abstract = {In many variability-intensive systems, variability is implemented in code units provided by a host language, such as classes or functions, which do not align well with the domain features. Annotating or creating an orthogonal decomposition of code in terms of features implies extra effort, as well as massive and cumbersome refactoring activities. In this paper, we introduce an approach for identifying and visualizing the variability implementation places within the main decomposition structure of object-oriented code assets in a single variability-rich system. First, we propose to use symmetry, as a common property of some main implementation techniques, such as inheritance or overloading, to identify uniformly these places. We study symmetry in different constructs (e.g., classes), techniques (e.g., subtyping, overloading) and design patterns (e.g., strategy, factory), and we also show how we can use such symmetries to find variation points with variants. We then report on the implementation and application of a toolchain, symfinder, which automatically identifies and visualizes places with symmetry. The publicly available application to several large open-source systems shows that symfinder can help in characterizing code bases that are variability-rich or not, as well as in discerning zones of interest w.r.t. variability.},

abstract = {A Software Product Line (SPL) is a family of related software systems distinguished by the different sets of features each system provides. Over the last decade, the substantial benefits of SPL practices have been extensively documented and corroborated both in academia and industry. Several architecture methods have been proposed that employ different artifacts for expressing the components of a SPL, their properties and relationships. Of crucial importance for any SPL architecture method is to guarantee that the variability, for instance as expressed in feature models, is not only preserved but also kept consistent across all artifacts used. In this research challenge paper we argue that Safe Composition - the guarantee that all programs of a product line are type safe - can be leveraged to address this guarantee for structural properties of SPL architectures and the challenges that that entails.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is one of the main techniques used in Software Product Line Engineering to manage the variability within the products of a family. Concrete products of the family can be generated through a configuration process. The configuration process selects and/or removes features from the feature model according to the stakeholders' requirements. Selecting the right set of features for one product from amongst all of the available features in the feature model is a complex task because: 1) the multiplicity of stakeholders' functional requirements; 2) the positive or negative impact of features on non-functional properties; and 3) the stakeholders' preferences w.r.t. the desirable non-functional properties of the final product. Many configurations techniques have already been proposed to facilitate automated product derivation. However, most of the current proposals are not designed to consider stakeholders' preferences and constraints especially with regard to non-functional properties. We address the software product line configuration problem and propose a framework, which employs an artificial intelligence planning technique to automatically select suitable features that satisfy both the stakeholders' functional and non-functional preferences and constraints. We also provide tooling support to facilitate the use of our framework. Our experiments show that despite the complexity involved with the simultaneous consideration of both functional and non-functional properties our configuration technique is scalable.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that software measures provide an appropriate mechanism for understanding, monitoring, controlling, and predicting the quality of software development projects. In software product lines (SPL), quality is even more important than in a single software product since, owing to systematic reuse, a fault or an inadequate design decision could be propagated to several products in the family. Over the last few years, a great number of quality attributes and measures for assessing the quality of SPL have been reported in literature. However, no studies summarizing the current knowledge about them exist. This paper presents a systematic literature review with the objective of identifying and interpreting all the available studies from 1996 to 2010 that present quality attributes and/or measures for SPL. These attributes and measures have been classified using a set of criteria that includes the life cycle phase in which the measures are applied; the corresponding quality characteristics; their support for specific SPL characteristics (e.g., variability, compositionality); the procedure used to validate the measures, etc. We found 165 measures related to 97 different quality attributes. The results of the review indicated that 92% of the measures evaluate attributes that are related to maintainability. In addition, 67% of the measures are used during the design phase of Domain Engineering, and 56% are applied to evaluate the product line architecture. However, only 25% of them have been empirically validated. In conclusion, the results provide a global vision of the state of the research within this area in order to help researchers in detecting weaknesses, directing research efforts, and identifying new research lines. In particular, there is a need for new measures with which to evaluate both the quality of the artifacts produced during the entire SPL life cycle and other quality characteristics. There is also a need for more validation (both theoretical and empirical) of existing measures. In addition, our results may be useful as a reference guide for practitioners to assist them in the selection or the adaptation of existing measures for evaluating their software product lines.},

abstract = {Feature models are widely used for modelling variability present in a Software Product Line family. We propose using cardinality-based feature models and clonable features to model and manage the evolution of the structural variability present in pervasive systems, composed by a large variety of heterogeneous devices. The use of clonable features increases the expressiveness of feature models, but also greatly increases the complexity of the resulting configurations. So, supporting the evolution of product configurations becomes an intractable task to do it manually. In this paper, we propose a model driven development process to propagate changes made in an evolved feature model, into existing configurations. Furthermore, our process allows us to calculate the effort needed to perform the evolution changes in the customized products. To do this, we have defined two operators, one to calculate the differences between two configurations and another to create a new configuration from a previous one. Finally, we validate our approach, showing that by using our tool support we can generate new configurations for a family of products with thousands of cloned features.},

abstract = {Creating and managing valid configurations is one of the main tasks in software product line engineering. Due to the often complex constraints from a feature model, some kind of automated configuration generation is required to facilitate the configuration process for users and developers. For instance, decision propagation can be applied to support users in configuring a product from a software product line (SPL) with less manual effort and error potential, leading to a semi-automatic configuration process. Furthermore, fully-automatic configuration processes, such as random sampling or t-wise interaction sampling can be employed to test or to optimize an SPL. However, current techniques for automated configuration generation still do not scale well to SPLs with large and complex feature models. Within our thesis, we identify current challenges regarding the efficiency and effectiveness of the semi- and fully-automatic configuration process and aim to address these challenges by introducing novel techniques and improving current ones. Our preliminary results show already show promising progress for both, the semi- and fully-automatic configuration process.},

Many different tools have been employed in this effort, such as mass customization, modularity, delayed differentiation, commonality, platforms, product families, and so on. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how fuzzy logic has been applied and how it can help to improve the entire process of product family development. Given its powerful capability to represent aspects that binary variables cannot, we show how fuzzy logic has been used to take advantage by considering the vague parameters related to the human character in different processes. Our aim is to contribute to the understanding and improvement of product family development process by identifying essential applications of fuzzy logic. An extended overview of the product family development process is provided, and also this work highlights the role of fuzzy logic in it. Fourteen fuzzy logic tools and thirteen topics into the product family development process are identified and summarized as a framework to analyze the role of fuzzy logic and at the same time to identify further application opportunities.},

Although functional performance specifications and adequacy of various design forms can be measured directly and objectively, many designers and engineers struggle with clearly evaluating product criteria requiring subjective consumer input; the fact that these inputs change over time further complicates the process. To appropriately evaluate product criteria, an effective design decision-making analysis is required. In this study, we propose a methodology to assure effective elicitation of needs and their inclusion in design decision making and illustrate it using a mobile phone product family design scenario. First, consumer perceived utility of design features is gathered using a questionnaire (500+ responses) and then modeled using multi- attribute utility theory to facilitate the evaluation of a product family while responding to needs across customer clusters shaped by demographics. The methodology goal is to determine the relative goodness of a product family in comparison to its competition. We also compare and evaluate the application of the proposed method to conjoint analysis.},

Hence, a core asset is a key element of PLE, and therefore the reusability of the core asset largely determines the success of PLE projects. However, current quality models to evaluate reusability do not adequately address the unique characteristics of core assets in PLE. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for evaluating the reusability of core assets. We first identify the key characteristics of core assets, and derive a set of quality attributes that characterizes the reusability of core assets. Then, we define metrics for each quality attribute and finally present practical guidelines for applying the evaluation framework in PLE projects. Using the proposed framework, the reusability of core assets can be more effectively and precisely evaluated.},

The majority of existing work treats software engineering problems from a single or bi-objective point of view, where the main goal is to maximize or minimize one or two objectives. However, most software engineering problems are naturally complex in which many conflicting objectives need to be optimized. Software refactoring is one of these problems involving finding a compromise between several quality attributes to improve the quality of the system while preserving the behavior. To this end, we propose a novel representation of the refactoring problem as a many-objective one where every quality attribute to improve is considered as an independent objective to be optimized. In our approach based on the recent NSGA-III algorithm, the refactoring solutions are evaluated using a set of 8 distinct objectives. We evaluated this approach on one industrial project and seven open source systems. We compared our findings to: several other many-objective techniques (IBEA, MOEA/D, GrEA, and DBEA-Eps), an existing multi-objective approach a mono-objective technique and an existing refactoring technique not based on heuristic search. Statistical analysis of our experiments over 31 runs shows the efficiency of our approach.},

Configuration Management is a mature discipline for that purpose. However traditional configuration management does not address product line evolution scenarios explicitly. Over time this can lead to great evolution management effort. This paper presents an infrastructure - in particular its validation - that sits on top of traditional configuration management and is tailored to evolution scenarios in Product Line Engineering.

There, the software product line scoping is one of most essential and complex activities because (1) a correct scope for the line has a high impact in its success and (2) it implies an interdisciplinary activity involving stakeholders with different visions about the products. In this paper, we report an exploratory study aimed to identify problems related to the collaborative work at scoping SPL in practice. We studied problems related to the participation and interaction of stakeholders in projects where groups of students must develop SPLs of serious video games for training employees in a company. Our study revealed problems related to low levels of communication, participants with different project objectives and stakeholders requesting different types of programs. Problems that are exacerbated by the staff rotation and inconveniences scheduling working sessions. In addition, our study revealed other problems regarding developers misunderstandings the artifacts related to the scope and their use in the further development activities. In this paper, we also present the first version of a collaborative method for SPL scoping, which seeks to combine scoping practices with collaborative patterns and thinkLets, with this combination we seek the effective participation of the required roles in this activity.},

abstract = {In order to improve software quality and reduce costs and deadlines, many companies are adopting Software Product Line approaches. As a consequence of globalization, another common practice is the adoption of Global Software Development approaches, which seek to find more qualified workforce and more attractive costs in companies distributed around the world. Taking into account the benefits of both approaches, the ramework proposed in this paper has the goal of aiding the management of global software teams involved in the implementation phase of an SPL project, providing recommendations on how to allocate the teams to the set of software components, which are initially specified in the SPL architecture and must be subsequently implemented.},

abstract = {A software product line is a family of programs where each program is defined by a unique combination of features. Product lines, like conventional programs, can be checked for safety properties through execution monitoring. However, because a product line induces a number of programs that is potentially exponential in the number of features, it would be very expensive to use existing monitoring techniques: one would have to apply those techniques to every single program. Doing so would also be wasteful because many programs can provably never violate the stated property. We introduce a monitoring technique dedicated to product lines that, given a safety property, statically determines the feature combinations that cannot possibly violate the property, thus reducing the number of programs to monitor. Experiments show that our technique is effective, particularly for safety properties that crosscut many optional features.},

abstract = {The proper configuration of systems has become a fundamental factor to avoid cybersecurity risks. Thereby, the analysis of cybersecurity vulnerabilities is a mandatory task, but the number of vulnerabilities and system configurations that can be threatened is extremely high. In this paper, we propose a method that uses software product line techniques to analyse the vulnerable configuration of the systems. We propose a solution, entitled AMADEUS, to enable and support the automatic analysis and testing of cybersecurity vulnerabilities of configuration systems based on feature models. AMADEUS is a holistic solution that is able to automate the analysis of the specific infrastructures in the organisations, the existing vulnerabilities, and the possible configurations extracted from the vulnerability repositories. By using this information, AMADEUS generates automatically the feature models, that are used for reasoning capabilities to extract knowledge, such as to determine attack vectors with certain features. AMADEUS has been validated by demonstrating the capacities of feature models to support the threat scenario, in which a wide variety of vulnerabilities extracted from a real repository are involved. Furthermore, we open the door to new applications where software product line engineering and cybersecurity can be empowered.},

abstract = {Mass customization efforts are challenged by an unpredictable growth or shrink in the market segments and shortened product life cycles which result in an opportunity loss and reduced profitability; hence we propose a concept of sustainable mass customization to address these challenges where an economically infeasible product for a market segment is replaced by an alternative superior product variant nearly at the cost of mass production. This concept provides sufficient time to restructure the product family architecture for the inclusion of a new innovative product variant while fulfilling the market segments with the customer delight and an extended profitability. To implement the concept of sustainable mass customization we have proposed the notions of generic-bill-Of-products (GBOP: list of product variants agreed for the market segments), its interface with generic-supply-chain-structure and strategic decisions about opening or closing of a market segment as an optimization MILP (mixed integer linear program) model including logistics and GBOP constraints. Model is tested with the varying market segments demands, sales prices and production costs against 1 to 40 market segments. Simulation results provide us an optimum GBOP, its respective segments and decisions on the opening or closing of the market segments to sustain mass customization efforts.},

abstract = {Product line-based software engineering is a paradigm that models the commonalities and variabilities of different applications of a given domain of interest within a unique framework and enhances rapid and low cost development of new applications based on reuse engineering principles. Despite the numerous advantages of software product lines, it is quite challenging to comprehensively test them. This is due to the fact that a product line can potentially represent many different applications; therefore, testing a single product line requires the test of its various applications. Theoretically, a product line with n software features can be a source for the development of 2n application. This requires the test of 2n applications if a brute-force comprehensive testing strategy is adopted. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary testing approach based on Genetic Algorithms to explore the configuration space of a software product line feature model in order to automatically generate test suites. We will show through the use of several publicly-available product line feature models that the proposed approach is able to generate test suites of O(n) size complexity as opposed to O(2n) while at the same time form a suitable tradeoff balance between error coverage and feature coverage in its generated test suites.},

To migrate a family of legacy software products into SPL for effective reuse, one has to understand commonality and variability among existing products variants. The existing techniques rely on manual identification and modeling of variability, and the analysis based on those techniques is performed at several mutually independent levels of abstraction. We propose a sandwich approach that consolidates feature knowledge from top-down domain analysis with bottom-up analysis of code similarities in subject software products. Our proposed method integrates model differencing, clone detection, and information retrieval techniques, which can provide a systematic means to reengineer the legacy software products into SPL based on automatic variability analysis.},

abstract = {Context: In large software organizations with a product line development approach, system test planning and scope selection is a complex task. Due to repeated testing: across different testing levels, over time (test for regression) as well as of different variants, the risk of redundant testing is large as well as the risk of overlooking important tests, hidden by the huge amount of possible tests. Aims: This study assesses the amount and type of overlaid manual testing across feature, integration and system test in such context, it explores the causes of potential redundancy and elaborates on how to provide decision support in terms of visualization for the purpose of avoiding redundancy. Method: An in-depth case study was launched including both qualitative and quantitative observations. Results: A high degree of test overlay is identified originating from distributed test responsibilities, poor documentation and structure of test cases, parallel work and insufficient delta analysis. The amount of test overlay depends on which level of abstraction is studied. Conclusions: Avoiding redundancy requires tool support, e.g. visualization of test design coverage, test execution progress, priorities of coverage items as well as visualized priorities of variants to support test case selection.},

abstract = {Companies are often forced to customize their software products. Thus, a common practice is to clone and adapt existing systems to new customer requirements. With the extractive approach, those derived variants can be migrated into a software product line. However, changing to a new development process is risky and may result in unnecessary costs. Therefore, companies apply cost estimations to predict whether another development approach is beneficial. Existing cost models for software-product-line engineering focus on development from scratch. Contrarily, the extractive approach is more common in practice but specialized models are missing. Thus, in this work we focus on product-line extraction from a set of legacy systems. We i) describe according cost factors, ii) put them in context with the development process and cost curves, and iii) identify open challenges in product-line economics. This way, our work supports cost estimations for the extractive approach and provides a basis for further research.},

A configuration-based setup along with automatic documentation functionality allows different experiments and supports their easy reproduction.Here, we describe KernelHaven as a product line analysis research tool and highlight its basic approach as well as its fundamental capabilities. In particular, we describe available information extraction and processing plug-ins and how to combine them. On this basis, researchers and interested professional users can rapidly conduct a first set of experiments. Further, we describe the concepts for extending KernelHaven by new plug-ins, which reduces development effort when realizing new experiments.},

abstract = {The cost of a Software Product Line (SPL) development project sometimes exceeds the initially planned cost, because of requirements volatility and poor quality. In this paper, we propose a cost overrun simulation model for time-boxed SPL development. The model is an enhancement of a previous model, specifically now including: consideration of requirements volatility, consideration of unplanned work for defect correction during product projects, and nominal project cost overrun estimation. The model has been validated through stochastic simulations with fictional SPL project data, by comparing generated unplanned work effort to actual change effort, and by sensitivity analysis. The result shows that the proposed model has reasonable validity to estimate nominal project cost overruns and its variability. Analysis indicates that poor management of requirements and quality will almost double estimation error, for the studied simulation settings.},

Furthermore, the existence of a BDD representing the configuration space of a product line removes the need to employ SAT or #SAT solvers for their analysis. Recent work has shown that the performance of state-of-the-art BDD libraries is significantly lower than previously reported and hypothesized. In this work, we provide an assessment of the state-of-the-art of BDD scalability in this domain and explain why previous results on the scalability of BDDs do not apply to more recent product-line instances.},

abstract = {Often, either to expand the target market or to satisfy specific new requirements, software systems inside a company are cloned, refactored, and customized, generating new derived software systems. Although this is a practical solution, it is not effective in the long-term because of the high maintenance costs when maintaining each of these derived software systems. Software product lines (SPLs) were proposed to reduce these costs; however, the lack of integration between variability realization mechanisms and version control systems reduces its attractiveness in the software development industry, especially in small and medium software companies. In this paper we propose an approach to integrate the conditional compilation mechanism used to implement the SPL variabilities and the Git version control system used to manage software versions in order to increase the attractiveness of the SPLs in the industry. The proposed solution also could be seen as a method to manage software system families' evolution in space and time.},

When a software system grow fast, configuring a product becomes a costly and error-prone activity due to the amount of features available for configuration. This process becomes more complex when for each feature, there is more than one component that implements it. Currently the tools available for configuration management do not have automated mechanisms to facilitate the optimal components selection that meet the functions required by a given product. In this paper, we introduce a prototype component-based recommender system called RESDEC (REcommender System that suggest implementation Components from selecteD fEatures) designed to manage the best implementation components alternatives. Our tool is validated using WordPress-based websites where the implementation components are represented by plugins and the recommendations generated by RESDEC help interested parties in the search and efficient plugins selection to configure websites.},

This activity becomes even much more challenging in Software Product Line (SPL) systems due to the variability of failures in SPL systems. These unexpected behaviors are caused by variability faults which can only be exposed under some combinations of system features. Although localizing bugs in non-configurable code has been investigated in-depth, variability fault localization in SPL systems still remains mostly unexplored. To approach this challenge, we propose a benchmark for variability fault localization with a large set of 1,570 buggy versions of six SPL systems and baseline variability fault localization performance results. Our hope is to engage the community to propose new and better approaches to the problem of variability fault localization in SPL systems.},

abstract = {Composition of requirements models in Software Product Line (SPL) development enables stakeholders to derive the requirements of target software products and, very important, to reason about them. Given the growing complexity of SPL development and the various stakeholders involved, their requirements are often specified from heterogeneous, partial views. However, existing requirements composition languages are very limited to generate specific requirements views for SPL products. They do not provide specialized composition rules for referencing and composing elements in recurring requirements models, such as use cases and activity models. This paper presents a multi-view composition language for SPL requirements, the Variability Modeling Language for Requirements (VML4RE). This language describes how requirements elements expressed in different models should be composed to generate a specific SPL product. The use of VML4RE is illustrated with UML-based requirements models defined for a home automation SPL case study. The language is evaluated with additional case studies from different application domains, such as mobile phones and sales management.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) have been around since the late 1970s and have established themselves as a way to deal with product variability. Tens of companies around the globe can pay testament to their advantages. Practitioners, however, have lamented the lack of data on other practitioners' experiences that would help them in the SPL journey. This work intends to analyze the application of SPLs in industry in the last 20 years. We departed from 194 industrial studies that were published at the Software Product Line Conference, the premier venue for SPL research. After the filtering process we selected 66 primary studies, from 43 different companies and 15 countries. The studies were classified to answer three research questions: (i) which contexts have SPLs been applied in?, (ii) what phenomena have been reported? and, (iii) what evidences have been collected in terms of obtained benefits, encountered issues and lessons learned? Regarding the context, SPLs have mainly been reported in USA and Germany (50%) and are used to develop embedded systems (76%). The most cited reason to adopt SPLs is the need to increase product variants (42.42%). As for the phenomena, the most reported problem area is adoption (39.39%). Last, as for evidences the most cited benefit is a cost reduction (53.03%), the issue is evolution (13.13%) and the learned lesson is that architecture is essential (24.24%). We believe the findings will be of interest to the community as a whole in quest to bridge the gap between industry and academia while balancing rigor, authenticity and relevance.},

abstract = {The Logistics Specification and Analysis Tool (LSAT) is a modelbased engineering tool used for design-space exploration of flexible manufacturing systems. LSAT provides domain specific languages to model a manufacturing system and means to analyze the productivity characteristics of such a system. In LSAT, developers can specify a system and model its deterministic operations as a set of activities. Given a set of activities, it is possible to construct an individual activity sequence that represents one valid system execution, and with minor variations in the specification individual systems can be obtained. To avoid modeling each variant separately, which means cloning and maintaining the common parts, new functionality is needed to deal with the variability of system specifications. In this study, we aim to establish integration between LSAT and product line engineering techniques. Specifically, we provide a realization of a toolchain including variability representation of LSAT realization artifacts and automated variant derivation for the LSAT model variants. Delta modeling, a transformational variability realization mechanism, is employed to model the variability within LSAT realization artifacts. Using the toolchain, we develop an industry-related case for a product line, the so called Extended Twilight System, a Cyber Physical System (CPS) inspired by the CPSs of our industrial partner.},

abstract = {Software product lines are widely used in the software industries to increase the re-usability and to decrease maintenance cost. On the other hand, systematic reviews are widely used in the software engineering research community to provide the overview of the research field and practitioners guidelines. Researchers have conducted many systematic studies on the different aspects of SPLs. To the best of our knowledge, till now there is no tertiary study conducted on systematic studies of SPL related research topics. In this paper, we aim at conducting a systematic mapping study of existing systematic studies to report the overview of the findings for researchers and practitioners. We performed snowballing and automated search to find out the relevant systematic studies. As a result, we analyzed 60 relevant studies to answer 5 research questions. The main focus of this tertiary study is to highlight the research topics, type of published reviews, active researchers and publication forums. Additionally, we highlight some of the limitations of the systematic studies. The important finding of this study is that the research field is well matured as the systematic studies covered a wide range of research topics. Another important finding is that many studies provided information for practitioners as well as researchers which is a notable improvement in the systematic reviews. However, many studies failed to assess the quality of the primary studies which is the major limitation of the existing systematic studies.},

abstract = {The possible variability of project delay is useful information to understand and mitigate the project delay risk. However, it is not sufficiently considered in the literature concerning effort estimation and simulation in software product line development. In this paper, we propose a project delay simulation model by introducing a random variable to represent the variability of adaptive rework. The model has been validated through stochastic simulations by comparing generated adaptive rework to an actual change effort distribution, and by sensitivity analysis. The result shows that the proposed model is capable of producing reasonable variability of adaptive rework, and consequently, variability of project delay. Analysis of our model indicates that the strength of dependency has a larger impact than the number of residual defects, for the studied simulation settings. However, high levels of adaptive rework variability did not have great impact on overall project delay.},

abstract = {Background: Previous research on three years of early data for an Eclipse product identified some predictors of failure-prone files that work well for that data set. Additionally, Eclipse has been used to explore characteristics of product line software in previous research.Aims: To assess whether change metrics are good predictors of failure-prone files over time for the family of products in the evolving Eclipse product line.Method: We repeat, to the extent possible, the decision tree portion of the prior study to assess our ability to replicate the method, and then extend it by including four more recent years of data. We compare the most prominent predictors with the previous study's results. We then look at the data for three additional Eclipse products as they evolved over time. We explore whether the set of good predictors change over time for one product and whether the set differs among products.Results: We find that change metrics are consistently good and incrementally better predictors across the evolving products in Eclipse. There is also some consistency regarding which change metrics are the best predictors.Conclusion: Change metrics are good predictors for failure-prone files for the Eclipse product line. A small subset of these change metrics is fairly stable and consistent across products and releases.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the merits and challenges of adopting software product line engineering (SPLE) as the main development process for an automotive Hall Effect sensor. This versatile component is integrated into a number of automotive applications with varying safety requirements (e.g., windshield wipers and brake pedals).This paper provides a detailed explanation as to why the process of safety assessment and verification of the Hall Effect sensor is currently cumbersome and repetitive: it must be repeated entirely for every automotive application in which the sensor is to be used. In addition, no support is given to the engineer to select and configure the appropriate safety solutions and to explain the safety implications of his decisions.To address these problems, we present a tailored SPLE-based approach that combines model-driven development with advanced model composition techniques for applying and reasoning about specific safety solutions. In addition, we provide insights about how this approach can reduce the overall complexity, improve reusability, and facilitate safety assessment of the Hall Effect sensor.},

abstract = {Although software product lines (PLs) can bring significant productivity and quality improvements through strategic reuse, bootstrapping existing products into a PL, and extending a PL with more products, is often risky and expensive. These kinds of PL derivation and evolution might require substantial effort and can easily affect the behavior of existing products. To reduce these problems, we propose a notion of product line refactoring and associated transformation templates that should be part of a PL refactoring catalogue. We discuss how the notion guides and improves safety of the PL derivation and evolution processes; the transformation templates, particularly when automated, reduce the effort needed to perform these processes.},

abstract = {Context: Verification techniques such as model checking are being applied to ensure that software systems achieve desired quality levels and fulfill their functional and non-functional specification. However, applying these techniques to software product lines is a twofold challenge, given the exponential blowup of the number of products and the state-explosion problem inherent to model checking. Current product-line verification techniques leverage symbolic model checking and variability information to optimize the analysis but still face limitations that make them costly or infeasible. In particular, state-of-the-art verification techniques for product-line reliability analysis are enumerative which hinders their applicability, given the latent blowup of the configuration space.Objective: Our objectives are the following: (a) we present a method to efficiently compute the reliability of all configurations of a compositional or annotation-based software product line from its UML behavioral models, (b) we provide a tool that implements the proposed method, and (c) we report on an empirical study comparing the performance of different reliability analysis strategies for software product lines.Method: We present a novel feature-family-based analysis strategy to compute the reliability of all products of a (compositional or annotation-based) software product line. The strategy employs a divide-and-conquer approach over UML behavioral models endowed with probabilistic and variability information. The feature-based step of our strategy divides the behavioral models into smaller feature-dependent fragments that can be analyzed more efficiently. Such analysis consists of creating a probabilistic model for each behavioral fragment and analyzing such model using a parametric model checker that returns an expression denoting its reliability. Parameters in such expression represent the reliabilities of fragments on which it depends at runtime. The family-based step performs the reliability computation for all configurations at once (conquer) by evaluating reliability expressions in terms of a suitable variational data structure. This step solves the expression computed for each behavioral fragment taking into account (a) the fragment's variability information and (b) the reliability values already computed for the fragments on which it depends. The result is an Algebraic Decision Diagram (ADD) whose terminals different than zero represent the reliability value of valid (partial) configurations for the fragment. Therefore, the ADD computed for the last evaluated fragment contains the reliability values for all valid configurations of the software product line.Results: We performed an experiment to compare our feature-family-based and other four state-of-the-art evaluation strategies (product-based, family-based, feature-product-based and family-product-based). The subjects were variations of six publicly available product lines, whose configuration spaces were progressively increased. The empirical results show that our feature-family-based strategy outperforms, in terms of time and space, the other four state-of-the-art strategies. In addition, it is the only one that could be scaled to a 220-fold increase in the size of the configuration space.Conclusion: Our feature-family-based strategy leverages both feature-based and family-based strategies by taming the size of the models to be analyzed (due to the decomposition of behavioral models into fragments) and by avoiding the products enumeration inherent to some state-of-the-art analysis methods by using ADDs to represent both variability and reliability values.Journal paper: This paper was published at the Information and Software Technology Journal.

abstract = {Several approaches to define Variability Models (VM) of non-functional requirements or quality attributes have been proposed. However, these approaches have focused on specific quality attributes rather than more general non-functional aspects established by standards such as ISO/IEC 25010 for software evaluation and quality. Thus, developing specific software products by selecting features and at the same time measuring the level of compliance with a standard/guideline is a challenge. In this work, we present the definition of an accessibility VM based on the web content accessibility guides (WCAG) 2.1 W3C recommendation, to obtain a quantitative measure to improve or construct specific SPL products that require to be accessibility-aware. This paper is specially focused on illustrating the experience of measuring the accessibility in a software product line (SPL) in order to check if it is viable measuring products and recommending improvements in terms of features before addressing the construction of accessibility-aware products. The adoption of the VM accessibility has been putted into practice through a pilot case study, the MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) initiative of the Universidad T\'{e}cnica Particular de Loja. The conduction of this pilot case study has allowed us to illustrate how it is possible to model and measure the accessibility in SPL using accessibility VM, as well as to recommend accessibility configuration improvements for the construction of new or updated MOOC platforms.},

abstract = {Configurable software systems can be adapted or configured according to a set of features to increase reuse and productivity. The testing process is essential because configurations that fail may potentially hurt user experience and degrade the reputation of a project. However, testing configurable systems is very challenging due to the number of configurations to run with each test, leading to a combinatorial explosion in the number of configurations and tests. Currently, several testing techniques and tools have been proposed to deal with this challenge, but their potential practical application remains mostly unexplored. To encourage the research area on testing configurable systems, researchers and practitioners should be able to try out their solutions in common datasets. In this paper, we propose a dataset with 22 configurable software systems and an extensive test suite. Moreover, we report failures found in these systems and source code metrics to allow evaluating candidate solutions. We hope to engage the community and stimulate new and existing approaches to the problem of testing configurable systems.},

abstract = {The Industry 4.0 initiative envisions the flexible and optimized production of customized products on Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) that consist of subsystems coordinated to conduct complex production processes. Hence, accurate CPPS modeling requires integrating the modeling of variability for Product-Process-Resource (PPR) aspects. Yet, current variability modeling approaches treat structural and behavioral variability separately, leading to inaccurate CPPS production models that impede CPPS engineering and optimization. This paper proposes a PhD project for integrated variability modeling of PPR aspects to improve the accuracy of production models with variability for CPPS engineers and production optimizers. The research project follows the Design Science approach aiming for the iterative design and evaluation of (a) a framework to categorize currently incomplete and scattered models and methods for PPR variability modeling as a foundation for an integrated model; and (b) a modeling approach for more accurate integrated PPR variability modeling. The planned research will provide the Software Product Line (SPL) and CPPS engineering research communities with (a) novel models, methods, and insights on integrated PPR variability modeling, (b) open data from CPPS engineering use cases for common modeling, and (c) empirical data from field studies for shared analysis and evaluation.},

abstract = {Although Software Product Lines are recurrently praised as an efficient paradigm for systematic reuse, practical adoption remains challenging. For bottom-up Software Product Line adoption, where a set of artefact variants already exists, practitioners lack end-to-end support for chaining (1) feature identification, (2) feature location, (3) feature constraints discovery, as well as (4) reengineering approaches. This challenge can be overcome if there exists a set of principles for building a framework to integrate various algorithms and to support different artefact types. In this paper, we propose the principles of such a framework and we provide insights on how it can be extended with adapters, algorithms and visualisations enabling their use in different scenarios. We describe its realization in BUT4Reuse (Bottom--Up Technologies for Reuse) and we assess its generic and extensible properties by implementing a variety of extensions. We further empirically assess the complexity of integration by reproducing case studies from the literature. Finally, we present an experiment where users realize a bottom-up Software Product Line adoption building on the case study of Eclipse variants.},

abstract = {A Software Product Line (SPL) is a family of similar programs (called variants) generated from a common artifact base. A Multi SPL (MPL) is a set of interdependent SPLs (i.e., such that an SPL's variant can depend on variants from other SPLs). MPLs are challenging to model and implement efficiently, especially when different variants of the same SPL must coexist and interoperate. We address this challenge by introducing variability modules (VMs), a new language construct. A VM represents both a module and an SPL of standard (variability-free), possibly interdependent modules. Generating a variant of a VM triggers the generation of all variants required to fulfill its dependencies. Then, a set of interdependent VMs represents an MPL that can be compiled into a set of standard modules. We illustrate VMs by an example from an industrial modeling scenario, formalize them in a core calculus, provide an implementation for the Java-like modeling language ABS, and evaluate VMs by case studies.},

abstract = {[Context &amp; Motivation] Developing new software systems based on a software product line (SPL) in so-called application engineering (AE) projects is still a time-consuming and expensive task. Especially when a large number of customer-specific requirements exists, there is still no systematic support for efficiently aligning these non-anticipated requirements with SPL characteristics early on. [Question/problem] In order to improve this process significantly, sound knowledge about an SPL must be available when guiding the requirements elicitation during AE. Thus, an appropriate reflection of SPL characteristics in process-supporting artifacts is indispensable for actually supporting a requirements engineer in this task. [Principal ideas/results] In this paper, a validated template for elicitation instructions that aims at providing a requirements engineer with knowledge about an underlying SPL in an appropriate manner is presented. This template consists of predefined text blocks and algorithms that explain how SPL-relevant product and process knowledge can be systematically reflected into capability-aware elicitation instructions. [Contribution] By using such elicitation instructions, requirements engineers are enabled to elicit requirements in an AE project more effectively.},

abstract = {Smart IT has an increasing influence on the control of daily life. For instance, smart grids manage power supply, autonomous automobiles take part in traffic, and assistive robotics support humans in production cells. We denote such systems as Cyber-physical Systems (CPSs), where cyber addresses the controlling software, while physical describes the controlled hardware. One key aspect of CPSs is their capability to adapt to new situations autonomously or with minimal human intervention. To achieve this, CPSs reuse, reorganize and reconfigure their components during runtime. Some components may even serve in different CPSs and different situations simultaneously. The hardware of a CPS usually consists of a heterogeneous set of variable components. While each component can be designed as a software product line (SPL), which is a well established approach to describe software and hardware variability, it is not possible to describe CPSs' variability solely on a set of separate, non-interacting product lines. To properly manage variability, a CPS must specify dependencies and interactions of its separate components and cope with variable environments, changing requirements, and differing safety properties. In this paper, we i) propose a classification of variability aspects, ii) point out current challenges in variability modeling, and iii) sketch open research questions. Overall, we aim to initiate new research directions for variable CPSs based on existing product-line techniques.},

abstract = {It is commonly accepted that quality attributes shape the architecture of a system. There are several means via which the architecture can support certain quality attributes. For example, to deal with reliability the system can be decomposed into a number of fault containment units, thus avoiding fault propagation. In addition to structural issues of architecture, qualities also influence architectural rules and guidelines, such as coding standards. In this paper we will focus on design aspects as a means of supporting quality attributes. An example of a design aspect is error handling functionality, which supports reliability. Quality attributes play a role in the problem domain; design aspects are elements in the solution domain.We will use an industrial case to illustrate our ideas. The discussion ranges from how design aspects are defined in the architecture based on quality attributes, to how design aspects can be used to verify the realized system against the prescribed architecture. The industrial case is a product family of medical imaging systems. For this product family, the family members are constructed from a component-based platform. Here, it is especially useful to achieve aspect-completeness of components, allowing system composition without worrying about individual design aspects.},

We developed a structural analysis method of variability for multiple product lines using an extended model of OVM (Orthogonal Variability Model). Together with the variability analysis method, we propose an agile application development method to refine development items according to variability dependency based on the analysis, and develop them incrementally.

abstract = {Variability models are used to build configurators. Configurators are programs that guide users through the configuration process to reach a desired configuration that fulfils user requirements. The same variability model can be used to design different configurators employing different techniques. One of the elements that can change in a configurator is the configuration workflow, i.e., the order and sequence in which the different configuration elements are presented to the configuration stakeholders. When developing a configurator, a challenge is to decide the configuration workflow that better suites stakeholders according to previous configurations. For example, when configuring a Linux distribution, the configuration process start by choosing the network or the graphic card, and then other packages with respect to a given sequence. In this paper, we present COnfiguration workfLOw proceSS mIning (COLOSSI), an automated technique that given a set of logs of previous configurations and a variability model can automatically assist to determine the configuration workflow that better fits the configuration logs generated by user activities. The technique is based on process discovery, commonly used in the process mining area, with an adaptation to configuration contexts. Our proposal is validated using existing data from an ERP configuration environment showing its feasibility. Furthermore, we open the door to new applications of process mining techniques in different areas of software product line engineering.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) engineering is a software development approach that takes advantage of the commonality and variability between products from a family, and supports the generation of specific products by reusing a set of core family assets. This paper proposes a UML model transformation approach for software product lines to derive a performance model for a specific product. The input to the proposed technique, the "source model", is a UML model of a SPL with performance annotations, which uses two separate profiles: a "product line" profile from literature for specifying the commonality and variability between products, and the MARTE profile recently standardized by OMG for performance annotations. The source model is generic and therefore its performance annotations must be parameterized. The proposed derivation of a performance model for a concrete product requires two steps: a) the transformation of a SPL model to a UML model with performance annotations for a given product, and b) the transformation of the outcome of the first step into a performance model. This paper focuses on the first step, whereas the second step will use the PUMA transformation approach of annotated UML models to performance models, developed in previous work. The output of the first step, named "target model", is a UML model with MARTE annotations, where the variability expressed in the SPL model has been analyzed and bound to a specific product, and the generic performance annotations have been bound to concrete values for the product. The proposed technique is illustrated with an e-commerce case study.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) seamlessly becomes integrated into many aspects of daily life, and in the case of healthcare, it arises in the shape of eHealth IoT systems. Evidently, the design of such systems must apply best practices when it comes to security and privacy, in addition to ensuring compliance with various national and international regulations. When it comes to the required functionality, commonalities and variations can effectively be managed in a product line approach that involves deriving specific application architecture variants from a common reference architecture.This paper illustrates and discusses a specific problem encountered in the establishment of a software product-line in this specific context: the adoption of systematic security and privacy threat modeling and risk assessment approaches introduces a variation space that is very difficult to capture in a proactive product-line approach. One of the main causes for this is that threat assessment itself suffers from the problem of threat explosion, i.e. combinatorial explosions of threats that have to be investigated and systematically mitigated. The highlighted divergence of the security and privacy threats across architectural variants is illustrated in the specific case of an industry IoT-based e-health software product line.},

abstract = {With highly fragmented market and increased competition, platform-based product family design has been recognized as an effective method to construct a product line that satisfies diverse customer's demands while aiming to keep design and production cost-effective. The success of the resulting product family often relies on properly resolving the inherent tradeoff between commonality across the family and performance loss. In this paper, a systematic multi-platforming product family approach is proposed to design a scale-based product family. In the light of the basic premise that increased commonality implies enhanced manufacturing efficiency, we present an effective platform decision strategy to quantify family design configuration using a commonality index that couples design varieties with production variation. Meanwhile, unlike many existing methods that assume a single given platform configuration, the proposed method addresses the multi-platforming configuration across the family, and can generate alternative product family solutions with different levels of commonality. A modified genetic algorithm is developed to solve the aggregated multiobjective optimization problem and an industrial example of a planetary gear train for drills is given to demonstrate the proposed method.},

The definition of an economically useful product line approach requires two things: analyzing return on investment (ROI) expectations of a product line and understanding the effort required for building reusable assets. We did a clone analysis to provide the basis for effort estimation for merge potential assessment of existing variants. We also report on a case study with ECS.

Such a process provides the means for the reuse of software assets which can considerably reduce the development time and the cost of software products. A comprehensive strategy for the evaluating the maturity of a software product family process is needed due to growing popularity of this concept in the software industry. In this paper, we propose a five-level maturity scale for software product family process. We also present a fuzzy inference system for evaluating maturity of software product family process using the proposed maturity scale. This research is aimed at establishing a comprehensive and unified strategy for process evaluation of a software product family.

abstract = {Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice widely adopted in the industry to allow frequent integration of code changes. During the CI process, many test cases are executed multiple times a day, subject to time constraints. In this scenario, a learning-based approach, named COLEMAN, has been successfully applied. COLEMAN allows earlier execution of the most promising test cases to reveal faults. This approach considers CI particularities such as time budget and volatility of test cases, related to the fact that test cases can be added/removed along the CI cycles. In the CI of Highly Configuration System (HCS), many product variants must be tested, each one with different configuration options, but having test cases that are common to or reused from other variants. In this context, we found, by analogy, another particularity, the volatility of variants, that is, some variants can be included/discontinued along CI cycles. Considering this context, this work introduces two strategies for the application of COLEMAN in the CI of HCS: the Variant Test Set Strategy (VTS) that relies on the test set specific for each variant, and the Whole Test Set Strategy (WST) that prioritizes the test set composed by the union of the test cases of all variants. Both strategies are evaluated in a real-world HCS, considering three test budgets. The results show that the proposed strategies are applicable regarding the time spent for prioritization. They perform similarly regarding early fault detection, but WTS better mitigates the problem of beginning without knowledge, and is more suitable when a new variant to be tested is added.},

Seeing the duality between products and processes, we propose to exploit flexibility provided by the product-line engineering approach for modeling business processes as a Business Process Line (BPL) in order to capture process variability, promote reuse and integration and provide the capacity to anticipate process changes. To support process evolution and consistency, we suggest the use of decision tables to elicit, track and manage all the emerging decision points during business process modeling, with the purpose of maintaining the relationships among business needs, environmental changes and process tasks. In a real case study we practiced the proposed methodology by leveraging the synergy of feature models, variability mechanisms and decision tables.

In particular, we provide the following contributions: (1) to shift existing product lines towards a model-based approach, we support the (semi-) automated extraction of models from existing requirement, test, and implementation artefacts; (2) to cope with the complexity of artefacts and their interrelations in industrial product lines, we support the generation of context-specific views. These views support developers, e.g., in analysing complex dependencies between different artefacts; (3) finally, we support automated product derivation based on an integrated hardware abstraction layer. Most of the presented concepts have been inspired by challenges arising in the industrial application of product line techniques in the model-based engineering of embedded systems. We report on experiences gathered during the application of the techniques to a prototypical product line (on a rapid prototyping platform in the university lab) and to industrial sample cases (at the industry partner).},

abstract = {Process models for software product-line engineering focus on proactive adoption scenarios---that is, building product-line platforms from scratch. They comprise the two phases domain engineering (building a product-line platform) and application engineering (building individual variants), each of which defines various development activities. Established more than two decades ago, these process models are still the de-facto standard for steering the engineering of platforms and variants. However, observations from industrial and open-source practice indicate that the separation between domain and application engineering, with their respective activities, does not fully reflect reality. For instance, organizations rarely build platforms from scratch, but start with developing individual variants that are re-engineered into a platform when the need arises. Organizations also appear to evolve platforms by evolving individual variants, and they use contemporary development activities aligned with technical advances. Recognizing this discrepancy, we present an updated process model for engineering software product lines. We employ a method for constructing process theories, building on recent literature as well as our experiences with industrial partners to identify development activities and the orders in which these are performed. Based on these activities, we synthesize and discuss the new process model, called promote-pl. Also, we explain its relation to modern software-engineering practices, such as continuous integration, model-driven engineering, or simulation testing. We hope that our work offers contemporary guidance for product-line engineers developing and evolving platforms, and inspires researchers to build novel methods and tools aligned with current practice.},

abstract = {Taxonomy-Based Software Construction (TABASCO) applies extensive domain analyses to create conceptual hierarchies of algorithmic domains. Those are used as basis for the implementation of software toolkits. The monolithic structure of TABASCO-based toolkits restricts their adoption on resource-constrained or special-purpose devices. In this paper, we address this problem by applying Software Product Line (SPL) techniques to TABASCO-based toolkits: We use software taxonomies as input to creating a conceptual representation of variability as feature models of an SPL. We apply the variability realization mechanism delta modeling to transform realization artifacts, such as source code, to only contain elements for a particular selection of features. Our method is suitable for proactive, reactive and extractive SPL development so that it supports a seamless adoption and evolution of an SPL approach for TABASCO-based toolkits. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method with three case studies by proactively, reactively and extractively transforming TABASCO-based toolkits to SPLs, which allow derivation of variants with custom-tailored functionality.},

abstract = {A key aspect for effective variability modeling of Software Product Lines (SPL) is to harmonize the need to achieve separation of concerns with the need to satisfy consistency of requirements and constraints. Techniques for variability modeling such as feature models used together with use scenarios help to achieve separation of stakeholders' concerns but ensuring their joint consistency is largely unsupported. Therefore, inconsistent assumptions about system's expected use scenarios and the way in which they vary according to the presence or absence of features reduce the models usefulness and possibly renders invalid SPL systems. In this paper we propose an approach to check consistency -- the verification of semantic relationships among the models -- between features and use scenarios that realize them. The novelty of this approach is that it is specially tailored for the SPL domain and considers complex composition situations where the customization of use scenarios for specific products depends on the presence or absence of sets of features. We illustrate our approach and supporting tools using variant constructs that specify how the inclusion of sets of variable features (that refer to uncommon requirements between products of a SPL) adapt use scenarios related to other features.},

abstract = {The Software Product Line (SPL) configuration field is an active area of research and has attracted both practitioners and researchers attention in the last years. A key part of an SPL configuration is a feature model that represents features and their dependencies (i.e., SPL configuration rules). This model can be extended by adding Non-Functional Properties (NFPs) as feature attributes resulting in Extended Feature Models (EFMs). Configuring products from an EFM requires considering the configuration rules of the model and satisfying the product functional and non-functional requirements. Although the configuration of a product arising from EFMs may reduce the space of valid configurations, selecting the most appropriate set of features is still an overwhelming task due to many factors including technical limitations and diversity of contexts. Consequently, configuring large and complex SPLs by using configurators is often beyond the users' capabilities of identifying valid combinations of features that match their (non-functional) requirements. To overcome this limitation, several approaches have modeled the product configuration task as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposed constraint programming algorithms to automatically derive a configuration. Although these approaches do not require any user intervention to guarantee the optimality of the generated configuration, due to the NP-hard computational complexity of finding an optimal variant, exact approaches have inefficient exponential time. Thus, to improve scalability and performance issues, we introduced the adoption of a greedy heuristic algorithm and a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). Our experiment results show that our proposed heuristics found optimal solutions for all instances where those are known. For the instances where optimal solutions are not known, the greedy heuristic outperformed the best solution obtained by a one-hour run of the exact algorithm by up to 67.89%. Although the BRKGA heuristic slightly outperformed the greedy heuristic, it has shown larger running times (especially on the largest instances). Therefore, to ensure a good user experience and enable a very fast configuration task, we extended a state-of-the-art configurator with the proposed greedy heuristic approach.},

abstract = {Software product line modeling has received a great deal of attention for its potential in fostering reuse of software artifacts across development phases. Research on the testing phase, has focused on identifying the potential for reuse of test cases across product line instances. While this offers potential reductions in test development effort for a given product line instance, it does not focus on and leverage the fundamental abstraction that is inherent in software product lines - variability.In this paper, we illustrate how rich software product line modeling notations can be mapped onto an underlying relational model that captures variability in the feasible product line instances. This relational model serves as the semantic basis for defining a family of coverage criteria for testing of a product line. These criteria make it possible to accumulate test coverage information for the product line itself over the course of multiple product line instance development efforts. Cumulative coverage, in turn, enables targeted testing efforts for new product line instances. We describe how combinatorial interaction testing methods can be applied to define test configurations that achieve a desired level of coverage and identify challenges to scaling such methods to large, complex software product lines.},

abstract = {In Software Product Lines (SPL), feature extraction from software requirements specifications has been subject to intense research in order to assist domain analysis in a time-saving way. Although various approaches are proposed to extract features, there still exists a gap to achieve the complete view of features, that is, how to figure out the intention of a feature. Feature terms as the smallest units in a feature can be regarded as vital indicators for describing a feature. Automated feature term extraction can provide key information regarding the intention of a feature, which improves the efficiency of domain analysis. In this paper, we propose an approach to train prediction models by using machine learning techniques to identify feature terms. To this end, we extract candidate terms from requirement specifications in one domain and take six attributes of each term into account to create a labeled dataset. Subsequently, we apply seven commonly used machine algorithms to train prediction models on the labeled dataset. We then use these prediction models to predict feature terms from the requirements belonging to the other two different domains. Our results show that (1) feature terms can be predicted with high accuracy of ≈ 90% within a domain (2) prediction across domains leads to a decreased but still good accuracy (≈ 80%), and (3) machine learning algorithms perform differently.},

In this paper we call such situation `global product family,' and first characterizes its components and complexity. Following this, we proposes a mathematical model for the simultaneous design problem of module commonalization strategies under the given product architecture and supply chain configuration through selection of manufacturing sites for module production, assembly and final distribution as an instance of the problems. In the model, the choice of modules and various sites are represented with 0-1 design variables with the volume of production and transportation represented with non-negative continuous design variables, and the objective defined on total cost. An optimization method is configured with a genetic algorithm and a simplex method for such a mixed integer programming problem. Some numerical case studies are included to determine the validity and promise of the developed mathematical model and algorithm. Finally, we conclude with some discussion of future work.},

abstract = {A plethora of variability modeling approaches has been developed in the last 30 years, e.g., feature modeling, decision modeling, Orthogonal Variability Modeling (OVM), and UML-based variability modeling. While feature modeling approaches are probably the most common and well-known group of variability modeling approaches, even within that group multiple variants have been developed, i.e., there is not just one type of feature model. Many variability modeling approaches have been demonstrated as useful for a certain purpose, e.g., domain analysis or configuration of products derived from a software product line. Nevertheless, industry frequently develops their own custom solutions to manage variability. The (still growing) number of modeling approaches simply makes it difficult to find, understand, and eventually pick an approach for a specific (set of) systems or context. In this paper, we discuss usage scenarios, required capabilities and challenges for an approach for (semi-)automatically transforming variability models. Such an approach would support researchers and practitioners experimenting with and comparing different variability models and switching from one modeling approach to another. We present the key components of our envisioned approach and conclude with a research agenda.},

abstract = {A product line is an approach for systematically managing configuration options of customizable systems, usually by means of features. Products are generated by utilizing configurations consisting of selected features. Product-line evolution can lead to unintended changes to product behavior. We illustrate that updating configurations after product-line evolution requires decisions of both, domain engineers responsible for product-line evolution as well as application engineers responsible for configurations. The challenge is that domain and application engineers might not be able to talk to each other. We propose a formal foundation and a methodology that enables domain engineers to guide application engineers through configuration evolution by sharing knowledge on product-line evolution and by defining configuration update operations. As an effect, we enable knowledge transfer between those engineers without the need to talk to each other. We evaluate our method by providing formal proofs that show product behavior of configurations can be preserved for typical evolution scenarios.},

abstract = {Since the definition of feature models in 1990, a large number of language constructs have emerged. Each language construct usually comes with its own abstract and concrete syntax, its semantics, and even its complete language dialect and tool support. Nowadays, there is a consensus in the Software Product Line community about a need for defining a common variability modeling language. But the fact of the matter is that it is very complex to achieve a good compromise between how expressive the language should be and the effort of developing practical tools for a language with all possible language constructs. In this paper, we propose an extensible model-driven engineering approach for defining the abstract syntax of feature modeling language constructs that could be tailored to different needs and domains. We formalize our approach as a set of modular and reusable metamodels that allows practitioners to decide which subset of language constructs to use through: (1) generating a new variability language; and (2) managing feature models with different level of expressiveness. We provide an instantiation and implementation of our approach.},

In this work, we explore the use of product line engineering in the emerging programming domain of synthetic biology. In synthetic biology, living organisms are programmed to perform new functions or improve existing functions. These programs are designed and constructed using small building blocks made out of DNA. We conjecture that there are families of products that consist of common and variable DNA parts, and we can leverage product line engineering to help synthetic biologists build, evolve, and reuse these programs. As a first step towards this goal, we perform a domain engineering case study that leverages an open-source repository of more than 45,000 reusable DNA parts. We are able to identify features and their related artifacts, all of which can be composed to make different programs. We demonstrate that we can successfully build feature models representing families for two commonly engineered functions. We then analyze an existing synthetic biology case study and demonstrate how product line engineering can be beneficial in this domain.},

abstract = {The importance of cyber-physical systems is growing very fast, being part of the Internet of Things vision. These devices generate data that could collapse the network and can not be assumed by the cloud. New technologies like Mobile Cloud Computing and Mobile Edge Computing are taking importance as solution for this issue. The idea is offloading some tasks to devices situated closer to the user device, reducing network congestion and improving applications performance (e.g., in terms of latency and energy). However, the variability of the target devices' features and processing tasks' requirements is very diverse, being difficult to decide which device is more adequate to deploy and run such processing tasks. Once decided, task offloading used to be done manually. Then, it is necessary a method to automatize the task assignation and deployment process. In this thesis we propose to model the structural variability of the deployment infrastructure and applications using feature models, on the basis of a SPL engineering process. Combining SPL methodology with Edge Computing, the deployment of applications is addressed as the derivation of a product. The data of the valid configurations is used by a task assignment framework, which determines the optimal tasks offloading solution in different network devices, and the resources of them that should be assigned to each task/user. Our solution provides the most energy and latency efficient deployment solution, accomplishing the QoS requirements of the application in the process.},

abstract = {With the advent of various services and applications of Semantic Web, semantic annotation has emerged as an important research topic. The application of semantically annotated ontology had been evident in numerous information processing and retrieval tasks. One of such tasks is utilizing the semantically annotated ontology in product design which is able to suggest many important applications that are critical to aid various design related tasks. However, ontology development in design engineering remains a time consuming and tedious task that demands considerable human efforts. In the context of product family design, management of different product information that features efficient indexing, update, navigation, search and retrieval across product families is both desirable and challenging. For instance, an efficient way of retrieving timely information on product family can be useful for tasks such as product family redesign and new product variant derivation when requirements change. However, the current research and application of information search and navigation in product family is mostly limited to its structural aspect which is insufficient to handle advanced information search especially when the query targets at multiple aspects of a product. This paper attempts to address this problem by proposing an information search and retrieval framework based on the semantically annotated multi-facet product family ontology. Particularly, we propose a document profile (DP) model to suggest semantic tags for annotation purpose. Using a case study of digital camera families, we illustrate how the faceted search and retrieval of product information can be accomplished. We also exemplify how we can derive new product variants based on the designer's query of requirements via the faceted search and retrieval of product family information. Lastly, in order to highlight the value of our current work, we briefly discuss some further research and applications in design decision support, e.g. commonality analysis and variety comparison, based on the semantically annotated multi-facet product family ontology.},

abstract = {The Common Variability Language (CVL) has become a reference in the specification and resolution of variability in the last few years. Despite the multiple advantages of CVL (orthogonal variability, architecture variability resolution, MOF-compliant, standard proposed,...), several approaches require extending and/or modifying the CVL approach in different ways in order to fulfill the industrial needs for variability modeling in Software Product Lines. However, the community lacks a tool that would enable proposed extensions and the integration of novel approaches to be put into practice. Existing tools that provide support for CVL are incomplete or are mainly focused on the variability model's editor, instead of executing the resolution of the variability over the base models. Moreover, there is no API that allows direct interaction with the CVL engine to extend or use it in an independent application. In this paper, we identify the extension points of the CVL approach with the goal of making the CVL engine more flexible, and to help software architects in the task of resolving the variability of their products. The practical tool presented here is a working implementation of the CVL engine, that can be extended through a proposed API.},

abstract = {Software product line supports structured reuse of software artifacts in order to realize the maintenance and evolution of the typically large number of variants, which promotes the industrialization of software development, especially for software-intensive products. However, for a legacy system, it is non-trivial to gain information about commonalities and differences of the variants. Meanwhile, software requirements specifications as the initial artifacts can be used to achieve this information to generate a domain model. Unfortunately, manually analyzing these requirements is time-consuming and inefficient. To address this problem, we explored the usage of feature extraction techniques to automatically extract domain knowledge from requirements to assist domain engineers. In detail, we applied Doc2Vec and a clustering algorithm to process the requirements for achieving the initial feature tree. Moreover, we utilized key words/phrases extraction techniques to provide key information to domain engineers for further analyzing the extraction results. In particular, we developed a GUI to support the extraction process. The empirical evaluation indicates that most of the extracted features and terms are beneficial to improve the process of feature extraction.},

abstract = {A large number of software products may be derived from an original single product. Although software product line engineering is advocated as an effective approach to maintaining such a family of products, re-engineering existing products requires developers to understand the evolution history of the products. This can be challenging because developers typically only have access to product source code. In this research, we propose to extract a Product Evolution Tree that approximates the evolution history from source code of products. Our key idea is that two successive products are the most similar to one another in the evolution history. We construct a Product Evolution Tree as a minimum spanning tree whose cost function is defined by the number of similar files between products. As an experiment, we extracted Product Evolution Trees from 6 datasets of open-source projects. The result showed that 53% to 92% of edges in the extracted trees were consistent with the actual evolution history of the projects.},

abstract = {Families of related MATLAB/Simulink systems commonly emerge ad hoc using clone-and-own practices. Extractively migrating systems towards a software product line (SPL) can be a remedy. A feature model (FM) represents all potential configurations of an SPL, ideally, in non-technical domain terms. However, yielding a sensible FM from automated synthesis remains a major challenge due to domain knowledge being a prerequisite for features to be adequate abstractions. In incremental reverse engineering, subsequent generation of FMs may further overwrite changes and design decisions made during previous manual FM refinement.In this paper, we propose an approach to largely automate the synthesis of a suitable FM from a set of cloned MATLAB/Simulink models as part of reverse engineering an SPL. We fully automate the extraction of an initial, i.e., a technical, FM that closely aligns with realization artifacts and their variability, and further provide operations to manually refine it to incorporate domain knowledge. Most importantly, we provide concepts to capture such operations and to replay them on a structurally different technical FM stemming from a subsequent reverse engineering increment that included further systems of the portfolio. We further provide an implementation and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using two MATLAB/Simulink data sets from the automotive domain.},

Designers of variability-rich software face the challenge of reasoning about the impact of selecting such features on the quality attributes of the resulting software variant. Attributed feature models have been proposed to model such features and their impact on quality attributes, but existing variability modelling languages and tools have limited or no support for such models and the complex multi-objective optimization problem that arises. This paper presents ClaferMoo, a language and tool that addresses these shortcomings. ClaferMoo uses type inheritance to modularize the attribution of features in feature models and allows specifying multiple optimization goals. We evaluate an implementation of the language on a set of attributed feature models from the literature, showing that the optimization infrastructure can handle small-scale feature models with about a dozen features within seconds.},

abstract = {A Software Product Line (SPL) consists of a systematic reuse strategy to construct systems with less effort as long as they belong to the same family that share the same components and belong to the same domain of Marketplace. In this context, to support large-scale reuse, components of a Software Product Line should be easy to maintain. Thus, developers should be more concerned with anomalies known as code smells and more than that, co-occurrences known as Inter-smell deserve to be further studied to verify their real impact on maintainability in SPL. Thus, this paper conducts a study to investigate the impact of Inter-smell occurrences on maintainability in MobileMedia and Health Watcher SPLs. The results show that the presence of co-occurrences of Inter-smell did not negatively impact the maintenance of MobileMedia and Health Watcher SPLs, unlike results found in other studies in the literature, and even more, our results indicate that the metric Lack of Cohesion of Methods is one of the most important for the maintainability of object-oriented SPLs.},

abstract = {Along the last decade, several studies considered green software design as a key development concern to improve the energy efficiency of software. Yet, few techniques address this concern for Software Product Lines (SPL). In this paper, we therefore introduce two approaches to measure and reduce the energy consumption of a SPL by analyzing a limited set of products sampled from this SPL. While the first approach relies on the analysis of individual feature consumptions, the second one takes feature interactions into account to better mitigate energy consumption of resulting products.Our experimental results on a real-world SPL indicate that both approaches succeed to produce significant energy improvements on a large number of products, while consumption data was modeled from a small set of sampled products. Furthermore, we show that taking feature interactions into account leads to more products improved with higher energy savings per product.},

abstract = {We present BURST, a benchmarking platform for uniform random sampling techniques. With BURST, researchers have a flexible, controlled environment in which they can evaluate the scalability and uniformity of their sampling. BURST comes with an extensive --- and extensible --- benchmark dataset comprising 128 feature models, including challenging, real-world models of the Linux kernel. BURST takes as inputs a sampling tool, a set of feature models and a sampling budget. It automatically translates any feature model of the set in DIMACS and invokes the sampling tool to generate the budgeted number of samples. To evaluate the scalability of the sampling tool, BURST measures the time the tool needs to produce the requested sample. To evaluate the uniformity of the produced sample, BURST integrates the state-of-the-art and proven statistical test Barbarik. We envision BURST to become the starting point of a standardisation initiative of sampling tool evaluation. Given the huge interest of research for sampling algorithms and tools, this initiative would have the potential to reach and crosscut multiple research communities including AI, ML, SAT and SPL.},

abstract = {Testing configurable systems is a challenging task due to the combinatorial explosion problem. Sampling is a promising approach to reduce the testing effort for product-based systems by finding a small but still representative subset (i.e., a sample) of all configurations for testing. The quality of a generated sample wrt. evaluation criteria such as run time of sample generation, feature coverage, sample size, and sampling stability depends on the subject systems and the sampling algorithm. Choosing the right sampling algorithm for practical applications is challenging because each sampling algorithm fulfills the evaluation criteria to a different degree. Researchers keep developing new sampling algorithms with improved performance or unique properties to satisfy application-specific requirements. Comparing sampling algorithms is therefore a necessary task for researchers. However, this task needs a lot of effort because of missing accessibility of existing algorithm implementations and benchmarks. Our platform AutoSMP eases practitioners and researchers lifes by automatically executing sampling algorithms on predefined benchmarks and evaluating the sampling results wrt. specific user requirements. In this paper, we introduce the open-source application of AutoSMP and a set of predefined benchmarks as well as a set of T-wise sampling algorithms as examples.},

abstract = {In model-driven engineering of applications, the quality of the software architecture is realized and preserved in the successive stages of its lifecycle through model transformations. However, limited support for reuse in contemporary model transformation techniques forces developers of product line architectures to reinvent transformation rules for every variant of the product line, which can adversely impact developer productivity and in turn degrade the quality of the resulting software architecture for the variant. To overcome these challenges, this paper presents the MTS (Model-transformation Templatization and Specialization generative transformation process, which promotes reuse in model transformations through parameterization and specialization of transformation rules. MTS defines two higher order transformations to capture the variability in transformation rules and to specialize them across product variants. The core idea behind MTS is realized within a graphical model transformation tool in a way that is minimally intrusive to the underlying tool's implementation. The paper uses two product line case studies to evaluate MTS in terms of reduction in efforts to define model transformation rules as new variants are added to the product line, and the overhead in executing the higher order transformations. These metrics provide an indirect measure of how potential degradation in the quality of software architectures of product lines caused due to lack of reuse can be alleviated by MTS.},

abstract = {The specialization of the configuration space of a software system has been considered for targeting specific configuration profiles, usages, deployment scenarios, or hardware settings. The challenge is to find constraints among options' values that only retain configurations meeting a performance objective. Since the exponential nature of configurable systems makes a manual specialization unpractical, several approaches have considered its automation using machine learning, i.e., measuring a sample of configurations and then learning what options' values should be constrained. Even focusing on learning techniques based on decision trees for their built-in explainability, there is still a wide range of possible approaches that need to be evaluated, i.e., how accurate is the specialization with regards to sampling size, performance thresholds, and kinds of configurable systems. In this paper, we compare six learning techniques: three variants of decision trees (including a novel algorithm) with and without the use of model-based feature selection. We first perform a study on 8 configurable systems considered in previous related works and show that the accuracy reaches more than 90% and that feature selection can improve the results in the majority of cases. We then perform a study on the Linux kernel and show that these techniques performs as well as on the other systems. Overall, our results show that there is no one-size-fits-all learning variant (though high accuracy can be achieved): we present guidelines and discuss tradeoffs.},

SPLs represent a long-term investment so that their ongoing evolution becomes paramount and requires careful planning. While existing approaches enable to create an evolution plan for an SPL on feature-model (FM) level, they assume the plan to be rigid and do not support retroactive changes. In this paper, we present a method that enables to create and retroactively adapt an FM evolution plan while preventing undesired impacts on its structural and logical consistency. This method is founded in structural operational semantics and linear temporal logic. We implement our method using rewriting logic, integrate it within an FM tool suite and perform an evaluation using a collection of existing FM evolution scenarios.},

abstract = {Vulnerabilities in software systems result from faults, which occur at different stages in a software's life cycle, for example, in the design (i.e., undesired feature-interactions), the development (i.e., buffer overflows), or the operation (i.e., configuration errors). Various databases provide detailed information about vulnerabilities in software systems or the way to exploit it, but face severe limitations. The information is scattered across these databases, fluctuates in quality and granularity, and provides only an insight into a single vulnerability per entry. Even for a single software system it is challenging for any security-related stakeholder to determine the threat level, which consists of all vulnerabilities of the software system and its environment (i.e., operating system). Manual vulnerability management is feasible only to a limited extend if we want to identify all configurations that are affected by vulnerabilities, or determine a system's threat level and the resulting risk we have to deal with. For variant-rich systems, we also have to deal with variability, allowing different stakeholders to understand the threats to their particular setup. To deal with this variability, we propose vulnerability feature models, which offer a homogeneous view on all vulnerabilities of a software system. These models and the resulting analyses offer advantages in many disciplines of the vulnerability management process. In this paper, we report the research plan for our project, in which we focus on the model-based evaluation of vulnerabilities. This includes research objectives that take into account the design of vulnerability feature models, their application in the process of vulnerability management, and the impact of evolution, discovery, and verification of vulnerabilities.},

abstract = {In software product lines, engineers use variability models to explicitly represent commonalities and variability. A plethora of variability modeling approaches have been proposed in the last 30 years, and there is no standard variability modeling approach the community agrees on. Well-known approaches such as feature modeling or decision modeling exist in many different variants, most of which have been shown to be useful for at least one specific use case. Due to this variety of approaches researchers and practitioners alike struggle to find, understand, and eventually pick the right approach for a specific context or (set of) system(s). Practitioners in industry often develop custom solutions to manage the variability of various artifacts, like requirements documents or design spreadsheets. In this paper, we report on our ongoing research towards developing a framework for (semi-)automatically transforming variability models. Our approach supports researchers and practitioners experimenting with and comparing different variability modeling approaches and switching from one modeling approach to another. We present the research questions guiding our research and discuss the current status of our work as well as future work.},

The traditional case is that variants are created with ad-hoc reuse (e.g., copy-paste-modify to quickly respond to different customer needs) and practitioners want to reengineer them to an SPL. Several industrial cases have been presented in the literature to motivate the interest of the extraction and many case studies are used to validate methods and techniques for different activities during this adoption process.However, there is no catalog or repository that gather together case studies and artefacts related to extractive SPL adoption. In this paper we present ESPLA, a catalog of Extractive SPL Adoption case studies that aims to foster the advance of this field by providing comprehensive information about case studies that will be otherwise scattered in the literature. Researchers, practitioners and educators can use this catalog to find the case studies that better fit to their particular needs. Currently, ESPLA contains information about 123 case studies and it is intended to be a catalog that can be updated and extended by the community.},

abstract = {The impact of the Internet of Things (IoT) on the modern industrial and commercial systems is hard to be underestimated. Almost every domain favours from the benefits that IoT brings, and healthcare does not make an exception. This is also clearly demonstrated by a widespread adoption of eHealth systems that often arise from software product lines. Nevertheless, the benefits that IoT brings come together with new threats and risks.An eHealth system that processes many types of sensitive data sets the context for this thesis. Security and privacy gain crucial importance for successful operation and broad user acceptance of the system because of the properties of the data flows that it initiates and operates. However, due to a large number of feature combinations that originate from the software product line nature of the eHealth system in question, a combinatorial explosion of relevant configurations makes reaching security and privacy goals more difficult. Furthermore, another combinatorial explosion of threats and corresponding mitigation strategies for every configuration complicates the situation even further. Nonetheless, configurations that meet specific risk budgets need to be in place.Within this thesis, a new threat and risk management (TRM) framework will be provided. It is based on STRIDE and LINDDUN methodologies, and it will overcome existing limitations by employing components on feature space modelling, risk-driven scoring, configuration decision support, and regulatory compliance. Research outcomes that have been reached so far show promising developments on the vital framework components.},

To reduce these costs, migrating cloned legacy systems towards a software product line promises to enable systematic reuse and customization. For both, managing and migrating cloned systems, it remains a challenge to identify and map features in the systems. In this paper, we i) propose a semi-automatic process to identify and map features between legacy systems, ii) suggest a corresponding visualization approach, and iii) assess our process on a case study. The results indicate that our process is suitable to identify features and present commonalities and variability in cloned systems.

abstract = {A major goal of the software architecture discipline is to develop an environment that promotes the reuse of components across separate software projects. One of the areas that would most benefit from this reuse is in product families of similar software products. Many organizations are in the business of creating several closely related products, whether it be a line of cell phones, cameras, printers, or a banking software suite, each product will need very similar software, with only slight modifications based on the version being produced. In this case, two aspects are needed in order to improve the production of such organizations. First, a common architecture foundation should be shared by each of the products. Second, there should be at least some small amount of basic code at the core of each product that can be reused without modification.In this paper, we will examine current methods of software architecture styles and propose a best method for describing the architecture so that the core components can be reused in many products. Next, we will determine the best practices for describing how the components can be reused, specifically what should be included in both high level and low level documentation. Finally, we will look at software implementation details of how this strategy could be practically applied to projects in the software development industry.},

abstract = {The variability of a Software Product Line is usually both described in the problem space (by using a variability model) and in the solution space (i.e., the system implementation). If the two spaces are not aligned, wrong decisions can be done regarding the system configuration. In this work, we consider the case in which the variability model is not aligned with the solution space, and we propose an approach to automatically repair (possibly) faulty constraints in variability models. The approach takes as input a variability model and a set of combinations of features that trigger conformance faults between the model and the real system, and produces the repaired set of constraints as output. The approach consists of three major phases. First, it generates a test suite and identifies the condition triggering the faults. Then, it modifies the constraints of the variability model according to the type of faults. Lastly, it uses a logic minimization method to simplify the modified constraints. We evaluate the process on variability models of 7 applications of various sizes. An empirical analysis on these models shows that our approach can effectively repair constraints among features in an automated way.},

abstract = {Software performance is an important non-functional quality attribute and software performance evaluation is an essential activity in the software development process. Especially in embedded real-time systems, software design and evaluation are driven by the needs to optimize the limited resources, to respect time deadlines and, at the same time, to produce the best experience for end-users. Software product family architectures add additional requirements to the evaluation process. In this case, the evaluation includes the analysis of the optimizations and tradeoffs for the whole products in the family. Performance evaluation of software product family architectures requires knowledge and a clear understanding of different domains: software architecture assessments, software performance and software product family architecture. We have used a scenario-driven approach to evaluate performance and dynamic memory management efficiency in one Nokia software product family architecture. In this paper we present two case studies. Furthermore, we discuss the implications and tradeoffs of software performance against evolvability and maintenability in software product family architectures.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) are a well-accepted approach for self-adapting Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) at run-time. The DSPL approaches make decisions supported by performance models, which capture system features' contribution to one or more optimization goals. Combining performance models with Multi-Objectives Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) as decision-making mechanisms is common in DSPLs. However, MOEAs algorithms start solving the optimization problem from a randomly selected population, not finding good configurations fast enough after a context change, requiring too many resources so scarce in CPSs. Also, the DSPL engineer must deal with the hardware and software particularities of the target platform in each CPS deployment. And although each system instantiation has to solve a similar optimization problem of the DSPL, it does not take advantage of experiences gained in similar CPS. Transfer learning aims at improving the efficiency of systems by sharing the previously acquired knowledge and applying it to similar systems. In this work, we analyze the benefits of transfer learning in the context of DSPL and MOEAs testing on 8 feature models with synthetic performance models. Results are good enough, showing that transfer learning solutions dominate up to 71% of the non-transfer learning ones for similar DSPL.},

abstract = {Software and System Product Lines (SSPL) are the state-of-the-art for systematically reusing a common set of core assets in the development of similar products in a product family. A large number of SSPL success stories have been published in the last decade and commercial tool support is also available. SSPLs promise to reduce cost, to shorten time-to-market for new features, and to increase product quality by systematically reusing core assets in the development of three or more systems. However, an open challenge is SSPL engineering for safety-relevant systems such as automotive, avionic, or industrial automation systems. Safety-relevant systems have to be developed, analyzed, and certified according to safety standards such as IEC 61508. These standards demand the application of safety analyses such as Fault Tree Analysis and Failure Mode and Effect Analysis. Starting the safety analysis of each product variant of a SSPL from scratch is complex and very time-consuming. However, there are only few convincing cases, where SSPL approaches have been followed in safety engineering. To pave the way for a broader adoption of SSPL approaches, this paper reports practical experiences with industrial-strength methods and tools along an adaptive cruise control SSPL. The paper demonstrates how commercial tools can be used (i) to analyze safety-related aspects already in the architectural design, (ii) to model the results as component integrated component fault trees (C2FT), and (iii) to systematically reuse C2FT in the safety analysis of a concrete product. The results of the case study show that C2FT (i) can be easily integrated into a feature-oriented development process of SSPL, (ii) facilitate early consideration of safety in domain engineering, and (iii) reduce effort and complexity of safety analyses in application engineering.},

Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools have been used for a lexical analysis aimed at ambiguity indicators detection, and we have studied the necessary adaptations to those tools for pointing at potential variability, essentially by adding specific dictionaries for variability. We have identified also some syntactic rules able to detect potential variability, such as disjunction between nouns or pairs of indicators in a subordinate proposition. This paper describes a new prototype NLP tool, based on the spaCy library, specifically designed to detect variability. The prototype is shown to preserve the same recall exhibited by previously used lexical tools, with a higher precision.},

Despite its practical relevance, CPP has many drawbacks. Because of that it is very difficult to understand the variability implemented using CPP. To facilitate this task we provide an innovative analytics tool which bridges the gap between feature models as more abstract representations of variability and its concrete implementation with the means of CPP. It allows to interactively explore the entities of a source program with respect to the variability realized by conditional compilation. Thus, it simplifies tracing and understanding the effect of enabling or disabling feature flags.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is a technique for capturing commonality and variability. Feature models symbolize a representation of the possible application configuration space, and can be customized based on specific domain requirements and stakeholder goals. Most feature model configuration processes neglect the need to have a holistic approach towards the integration and satisfaction of the stakeholder's soft and hard constraints, and the application-domain integrity constraints. In this paper, we will show how the structure and constraints of a feature model can be modeled uniformly through Propositional Logic extended with concrete domains, called P(N). Furthermore, we formalize the representation of soft constraints in fuzzy P(N) and explain how semi-automated feature model configuration is performed. The model configuration derivation process that we propose respects the soundness and completeness properties.},

Several works have shown how to predict the effect of run-time options on performance. However it is yet to be studied how these prediction models behave when the software is built with different compile-time options. For instance, is the best run-time configuration always the best w.r.t. the chosen compilation options? In this paper, we investigate the effect of compile-time options on the performance distributions of 4 software systems. There are cases where the compiler layer effect is linear which is an opportunity to generalize performance models or to tune and measure runtime performance at lower cost. We also prove there can exist an interplay by exhibiting a case where compile-time options significantly alter the performance distributions of a configurable system.},

Software product families are series of related products that make intensive reuse of already developed components. Object-oriented design promotes reusability, so it is specially suited for designing the structure of product families. In this paper we present an object-oriented design of a product family of meshing tools, where all family members share the software structure. By instantiating the structure with particular algorithms and parameters, we can easily produce different tools of the family. A good family design allows us not only to combine existing algorithms but also to easily incorporate new ones, improving software family evolution. We show how the family design is used for the generation of finite element and finite volume meshing tools, as well as a new tool for image processing.},

Presented almost three decades ago, dozens of different variations and extensions to the original feature-modeling notation have been proposed, together with hundreds of variability management techniques building upon feature models. Unfortunately, despite several attempts to establish a unified language, there is still no emerging consensus on a feature-modeling language that is both intuitive and simple, but also expressive enough to cover a range of important usage scenarios. There is not even a documented and commonly agreed set of such scenarios.Following an initiative among product-line engineering researchers in September 2018, we present 14 usage scenarios together with examples and requirements detailing each scenario. The scenario descriptions are the result of a systematic process, where members of the initiative authored original descriptions, which received feedback via a survey, and which we then refined and extended based on the survey results, reviewers' comments, and our own expertise. We also report the relevance of supporting each usage scenario for the language, as perceived by the initiative's members, prioritizing each scenario. We present a roadmap to build and implement a first version of the envisaged common language.},

abstract = {Language development is inherently complex. With the support of a suitable language development environment most computer scientists could develop their own domain-specific language (DSL) with relative ease. Yet, when the DSL is the result of a configuration over a language product line (LPL)---a special software product line (SPL) of compilers/interpreters and corresponding IDE services---they fail to provide adequate support. An environment for LPL engineering should facilitate the underlying process involving three distinct roles: a language engineer developing the LPL, a language deployer configuring a language product, and a language user using the language product. Neither IDEs nor SPLE environments can cater all three roles and fully support the LPL engineering process with distributed, incremental development, configuration, and deployment of language variants. In this paper, we present an LPL engineering process for the distributed, incremental development of LPLs and an integrated language product line development environment supporting this process, catering the three roles, and ensuring the consistency among all artifacts of the LPL: language components implementing a language feature, the feature model, language configurations and the resulting language products. To create such an environment, we married the Neverlang language workbench and AiDE its LPL engineering environment with the FeatureIDE SPL engineering environment. While Neverlang supports the development of LPLs and deployment of language products, AiDE generates the feature model for the LPL under development, whereas FeatureIDE handles the feature configuration. We illustrate the applicability of the LPL engineering process and the suitability of our development environment for the three roles by showcasing its application for teaching programming with a growable language. In there, an LPL for Javascript was developed/refactored, 15 increasingly complex language products were configured/updated and finally deployed.},

In product line development, the problem area is divided into the domain engineering and application engineering for delivering diverse products. Now, the development of automotive software requires agility and extreme diversity. Conventional simple product line model could not accommodate the requirements. Therefore, we developed an agile development method for automotive multiple product lines. First, we propose an agile development method for multiple product lines by iteratively reusing process assets in application engineering. To manage the diversity of the products derived from the multiple product lines, we propose a management method which integrates the portfolio management and product development management into the agile development method. We applied the proposed method to the development of multiple product lines for our automotive software systems, and demonstrated a reduction of the cost and complexity of the multiple product lines, and improvement of on-time delivery.},

abstract = {Many product families are modest in the sense that they consist of a sequence of incremental products with, at any point in time, only a few distinct products available and minimal variations among the products. Such product families, nevertheless, are often large, complex systems, widely deployed, and possessing stringent safety and performance requirements. This paper describes a case study that tends to confirm the value of using a product-line approach for the architectural design of a modest product family. The paper describes the process, design alternatives, and lessons learned, both positive and negative, from the architectural design of one such family of medical image analysis products. Realized benefits included identifying previously unrecognized common behavior and sets of features that were likely to change together, aligning the architecture with specific market needs and with the organization, and reducing unplanned dependencies. Most interesting were the unanticipated benefits, including decoupling the product-family architecture from the order of implementation of features, and using the product-family architecture as a 'guiding star' with subsequent releases moving toward, rather than away from, the planned architecture.},

abstract = {Summary form only given. A product line is a family of similar products with variations in features and functions. Product Line Engineering (PLE) is an engineering discipline for product lines using a shared set of engineering assets, a managed set of features, and an efficient means of production. It takes advantage of the commonality shared across the family while efficiently and systematically managing the variation among the products. PLE can trace its roots in software back to the 1970s; its roots in manufacturing go back centuries. But only the relatively recent (2000s or so) advent of industrial-strength automation and methodology has enabled Systems and Software PLE to emerge as a reliably repeatable engineering paradigm. It is worth studying because of the phenomenal improvements in product time to market, engineering productivity, portfolio scalability, and system quality that PLE has shown, over and over, to bring to organizations that apply it. This talk explains the fundamentals of modern PLE, shares some brief case studies, and discusses how the underpinnings of formal methods and notations are enabling PLE to achieve its remarkable results.},

The approach is based on a feature-modelling technique that directly deals with flexibility of reusable software assets in software product line engineering. We also propose a Hybrid between Passive/Active Behaviours (Hy-PAB) architecture model to support two extreme sets of behaviours for DFD: an active coordinating behaviour that controls the interactions with other features, and a passive subordinating behaviour that allows other features to control their interactions with other features.},

abstract = {Managing the evolution of system families in space and time, i.e., system variants and their revisions is still an open challenge. The software product line (SPL) approach can support the management of product variants in space by reusing a common set of features. However, feature changes over time are often necessary due to adaptations and/or bug fixes, leading to different product versions. Such changes are commonly tracked in version control systems (VCSs). However, VCSs only deal with the change history of source code, and, even though their branching mechanisms allow to develop features in isolation, VCS does not allow propagating changes across variants. Variation control systems have been developed to support more fine-grained management of variants and to allow tracking of changes at the level of files or features. However, these systems are also limited regarding the types and granularity of artifacts. Also, they are cognitively very demanding with increasing numbers of revisions and variants. Furthermore, propagating specific changes over variants of a system is still a complex task that also depends on the variability-aware change impacts. Based on these existing limitations, the goal of this doctoral work is to investigate and define a flexible and unified approach to allow an easy and scalable evolution of SPLs in space and time. The expected contributions will aid the management of SPL products and support engineers to reason about the potential impact of changes during SPL evolution. To evaluate the approach, we plan to conduct case studies with real-world SPLs.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering (SPLE) enables systematic reuse in development of a family of related software systems by explicitly defining commonalities and variabilities among the individual products in the family. Nowadays, SPLE is used in a variety of complex domains such as avionics and automotive. As such domains include safety critical systems which exhibit probabilistic behavior, there is a major need for modeling and verification approaches dealing with probabilistic aspects of systems in the presence of variabilities. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model, Discrete Time Markov Chain Family (DTMCF), which compactly represents the probabilistic behavior of all the products in the product line. We also provide a probabilistic model checking method to verify DTMCFs against Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) properties. This way, instead of verifying each product individually, the whole family is model checked at once, resulting in the set of products satisfying the desired property. This reduces the required cost for model checking by eliminating redundant processing caused by the commonalities among the products.},

abstract = {Variability management is an important issue for the software-intensive systems domain. Such an issue is essential for the success of software product line (SPL) adoption strategies. Although it is a well-discussed subject in the SPL community, there is a lack of tool support for environments that handle UML-based SPL variabilities, as several variability management approaches take UML as a basis, specially its profiling mechanism. Such environments might handle variabilities for several reasons, such as, evaluating SPLs, defining and applying metrics based on a SPL modeling, and automating the product generation. Therefore, this paper presents the SMartyParser, a parser for processing UML-based SPL models. Such models can be obtained, in the XMI format, from every UML specification-compliant tool. Such a parser provides several services to make it easier the handling of variability data in a particular SPL environment/tool. SMartyParser was built by taking the Open Core framework as a basis for processing XMI files. A parser use example is presented by taking into account the SPL Arcade Game Maker UML models.},

abstract = {Feature models are widely used for describing the variability of a software product line. A feature model contains a tree of features and a set of constraints over these features, which define valid feature combinations. In the industrial practice, large feature models containing hundreds of features and constraints are common. Furthermore, in a hierarchical product line a feature model can be related to other feature models through inter-model constraints. Due to the model size and complexity, understanding industrial feature models is a challenging task.In this paper, we describe the feature model understanding challenges reported by feature model developers at Robert Bosch GmbH. To support the developers in model understanding, we extend the idea of a feature implication graph to feature relation graph by abstracting groups of implications to feature relations. A transitively closed relation graph shows all modeled and implicit feature relations and spans all related feature models. The graph is also used to identify modeling problems, such as false optional or dead features, and to show the derivation of any implicit relation or problem from the modeled constraints. In a case study at Bosch, we evaluate the use of feature relation graph for model understanding. We propose further use cases of the graph, supporting model maintenance, evolution and configuration.},

abstract = {The proliferation of cyber-physical systems has encouraged the emergence of new technologies and paradigms to improve the performance of IoT-based applications. Edge Computing proposes using the nearby devices in the frontier/Edge of the access network for deploying application tasks. However, the functionality of cyberphysical systems, which is usually distributed in several devices and computers, imposes specific requirements on the infrastructure to run properly. The evolution of an application to meet new user requirements and the high diversity of hardware and software technologies in the edge can complicate the deployment of evolved applications.The aim of our approach is to apply Multi Layer Feature Models, which capture the variability of applications and the infrastructure, to support the deployment in edge-based environments of cyber-physical systems applications. This separation can support the evolution of application and infrastructure. Considering that IoT/Edge/Cloud infrastructures are usually shared by many applications, the SPL deployment process has to assure that there will be enough resources for all of them, informing developers about the alternatives of deployment. Prior to its deployment and leaning on the infrastructure feature models, the developer can calculate what is the configuration of minimal set of devices supporting application requirements of the evolved application. In addition, the developer can find which is the application configuration that can be hosted in the current evolved infrastructure.},

However, instantiation is often conducted in manual and ad-hoc fashion, largely replying on domain knowledge and experience. Hence, it can easily lead to technical problems in precisely specifying decision model consisting of product-specific variation points and variants, and in handling inter-variant conflicts/dependency. To overcome this difficulty, it is desirable to develop a systematic process which includes a set of systematic activities, detailed instructions, and concrete specification of artifacts. In this paper, we first propose a meta-model of a core asset to specify its key elements. Then, we represent a comprehensive process that defines key instantiation activities, representations of artifacts, and work instructions. With the proposed process, one can instantiate core assets more effectively and systematically.},

One basic research issue in SPLE is the product derivation problem, which focuses on how to derive software products from reusable software assets efficiently. In this paper, we focus on a sub-problem of product derivation: the problem of automated use case derivation, i.e. deriving the use cases of a software product in an automated way. We take a feature-oriented approach to this problem, an approach involving two components: a feature model, and the transformation information from the feature model to a set of use cases. In particular, we propose a transformation description language (TDL) to specify the transformation information from a feature model to a set of related use cases, and to support automated derivation of use cases corresponding to a valid feature model configuration. In addition, we also propose a set of criteria to check the validity of a TDL program. Three case studies have been conducted to demonstrate the usability of TDL and the feasibility of the automated use case derivation process based on TDL programs.},

Given the nature of Software Product Lines (SPL), the importance of requirements engineering is more pronounced as SPLs pose more complex challenges than development of a 'single' product. Several methods have been proposed in the literature, which encompass activities for capturing requirements, their variability and commonality. To investigate the maturity and effectiveness of the current requirements engineering approaches in software product lines, we develop an evaluation framework containing a set of evaluation criteria and assess feature oriented requirements engineering methods based on the proposed criteria. As a result of this initial study, we find out the majority of approaches lacks proper techniques for supporting the validation of family requirements models as well as dealing with delta requirements. Additionally, capturing stakeholders' preferences and applying them during the course of software feature configuration have not been taken into account and addressed in the proposed approaches.},

In an initial evaluation of the PAxSPL in a real-world scenario, we could observe the need for including scoping activities and implementing a tool to make the framework more adoptable in practice. In this paper, we describe how we performed these improvements. We performed the evolution of PAxSPL by including SPL scoping concepts and activities into our framework as well as developing a supporting tool. We also conducted a pilot study to evaluate how PAxSPL allows instantiating a scenario where the SPL reengineering were conducted. The results show that all artifacts, activities, and techniques from the scenario could be properly represented. However, we also identified a potential limitation during the assembly of techniques regarding parallel activities. The main contribution is PAxSPL_v2 that makes the framework more adherent to industries performing the reengineering of legacy systems into SPLs.},

abstract = {Comprehending and characterizing the spread and interaction of features in a software system is know to be difficult and error-prone. This paper presents FeatureVista, a lightweight tool providing interactive, glyph-based, and iconic visualization concepts designed to visually characterize the feature locations in software assets (source code). FeatureVista supports navigating between software components and features in an equal fashion. Our pilot study indicates that FeatureVista is intuitive and supports comprehending features. It helps to precisely characterize relations among features in large software systems and to contrast explicit software component definitions (e.g., package, class, method) with annotated feature portions---which so far was a largely manual and error-prone activity, albeit essential to get an adequate understanding of a software system. We suggest research directions for true, feature-oriented interfaces that can be used to manage software assets.},

abstract = {The detection of interactions is a challenging task present in almost all stages of software development. In feature-oriented system design, this task is mainly investigated for interactions of features within a single system, detected by their emergent behaviors. We propose a formalism to describe interactions in hierarchies of feature-oriented systems (hierarchical interactions) and the actual situations where features interact (active interplays). Based on the observation that such interactions are also crucial in role-based systems, we introduce a compositional modeling framework based on concepts and notions of roles, comprising role-based automata (RBAs). To describe RBAs, we present a modeling language that is close to the input language of the probabilistic model checker Prism. To exemplify the use of RBAs, we implemented a tool that translates RBA models into Prism and thus enables the formal analysis of functional and non-functional properties including system dynamics, contextual changes, and interactions. We carry out two case studies as a proof of concept of such analyses: First, a peer-to-peer protocol case study illustrates how undesired hierarchical interactions can be discovered automatically. Second, a case study on a self-adaptive production cell demonstrates how undesired interactions influence quality-of-service measures such as reliability and throughput.},

abstract = {Feature models are the "de facto" standard for variability modelling and are used in both academia and industry. The MODEVAR initiative tries to establish a common textual feature modelling language that can be used by different communities and can allow information sharing. Feature model related researches use different models for different purposes such as analysis, sampling, testing, debugging, teaching, etc. Those models are shared in private repositories and there is a risk that all that knowledge is spread across different platforms which hinder collaboration and knowledge reuse. In this paper, we propose a first working version of a new feature model repository that allows to centralise the knowledge generated in the community together with advanced capabilities such as DOI generation, an API, analysis reports, among others. Our solution is a front end interface that uses the popular open science repository Zenodo as an end point to materialise the storage of all the information. Zenodo is enhanced with characteristics that facilitate the management of the models. The idea of our repository is to provide existing but also new features that are not present in other repositories (e.g., SPLOT). We propose to populate our repository with all the existing models of many sources including SPLOT.},

This approach represents the design priority and related design constraints within a product using a structural graph, helping designers to create variant design solutions in a product family for different market requests. The methodology proposed here is illustrated via the example of the design of a family of automatic drip coffee makers.},

abstract = {Change is inevitable for software systems to deal with the evolving environment surrounding them, and applying changes requires careful design and implementation not to break existing functionalities. Evolution in software product lines (SPLs) is more complex compared to evolution for individual products: a change applied to a single feature might affect all the products in the whole product family. In this paper we present an approach for change impact analysis in delta-oriented programming (DOP), an existing language aimed at supporting SPLs. We propose the CIAHelper tool to identify dependencies within a DOP program, by analyzing the semantics of both the code artifacts and variability models to construct a directed dependency graph. We also consider how the source code history could be used to enhance the recall of detecting the affected artifacts given a change proposal. We evaluate our approach by means of five case studies on two different DOP SPLs.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) has arisen as an approach for developing a family of software-intensive systems at lower costs, within shorter time, and with higher quality. In particular, SPL is supported by a product line architecture (sometimes also referred to as reference architecture) that captures the architectures of a product family. In another context, a special type of architecture that contains knowledge about a specific domain has been increasingly investigated, resulting in the Reference Architecture research area. In spite of the positive impact of this type of architecture on reuse and productivity, the use of existing domain-specific reference architectures as basis of SPL has not been widely explored. The main contribution of this paper is to present how and when elements contained in existing reference architectures could contribute to the building of SPL artifacts during development of an SPL. We have observed that, in fact, reference architectures could make an important contribution to improving reuse and productivity, which are also important concerns in SPL.},

abstract = {Many variability-rich object-oriented systems rely on multiple traditional techniques (inheritance, patterns) to implement their variability in a single codebase. These variability implementation places are neither explicit nor documented, hampering their detection and variability comprehension. Based on the identification of symmetry property in seven implementation techniques, a first approach was proposed with symfinder to automatically identify and display the variability of a system in a graph-based visualization structured by inheritance. However, composition, or more generally the usage relationship, is extensively used to implement the variability in object-oriented systems, and without this information, comprehending the large amount of variability identified by symfinder is not trivial. In this paper, we present symfinder-2, an extension of the former approach that incorporates the usage relationships to better identify potential variability implementations. We provide two ways to mark classes as entry points, user-defined and automatic, so that the visualization is filtered and enables users to have a better focus when they identify variability. We also report on the evaluation of this extension to ten open-source Java-based systems.},

abstract = {Quality assurance for product lines is often infeasible for each product separately. Instead, only a subset of all products (i.e., a sample) is considered during testing such that at least the coverage of certain feature interactions is guaranteed. While pair-wise interaction sampling only covers all interactions between two features, its generalization to t-wise interaction sampling ensures coverage for all interactions among t features. However, sampling large product lines poses a challenge, as today's algorithms tend to run out of memory, do not terminate, or produce samples, which are too large to be tested. To initiate a community effort, we provide a set of large real-world feature models with up-to 19 thousand features, which are supposed to be sampled. The performance of sampling approaches is evaluated based on the CPU time and memory consumed to retrieve a sample, the sample size for a given coverage (i.e. the value of t) and whether the sample achieves full t-wise coverage. A well-performing sampling algorithm achieves full t-wise coverage, while minimizing the other properties as best as possible.},

This problem originates from the interchangeability for fulfilling functional and QoS concerns during composition. The approach utilizes the perspective of QoS to design and analyze a set of software systems represented by a collection of QoS systemic paths, which determine how well functional tasks perform in terms of flows of application-specific and functionality-determined information between components. Our approach not only reserves the virtues of reusability, changeability, productivity and expeditiousness that traditional CBSE and SPL technologies possess, but also dedicates the contributions in terms of separation of concerns, design space exploration, fine-grained commonality and reusability evaluation and less subjective feasibility analyses for a component-based SPL.},

As a first step towards a better understanding of this field, this paper applies two of these approaches-- FeatureMapper as a representative of declarative approaches and VML* as a representative of operational approaches--to the case study. We show in detail how the case study can be expressed using these approaches and discuss strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches with regard to the case study.},

abstract = {When developers maintain or evolve software, they often need to know the locations of features. This proves challenging when the feature locations are not documented, when the code was written by different developers who may have left the organization, or when the developer's memory of the implementation has faded. Automated feature location techniques are hard to adopt in practice, especially since they boast too many false positives. To address these challenges, embedded feature annotations have been proposed to allow developers to trace features in code during development with minimal effort. However, tool support is needed for developers to effectively record and use these annotations. We propose HAnS as a tool to meet this need; it is implemented as an IntelliJ IDE plugin to support developers seamlessly record feature locations while they write their code. HAnS supports developers when mapping features to software assets, such as files and code fragments, with code completion and syntax highlighting. It also provides functionality to browse feature definitions and locations, as well as refactor features. A demo video is available at https://youtu.be/cx_-ZshHLgA.},

abstract = {Software product lines using feature models often require the relation between feature models in problem space and the models used to describe the details of the product line to be expressed explicitly. This is particularly important, where automatic product derivation is required. Different approaches for modelling this mapping have been proposed in the literature. However, a discussion of their relative benefits and drawbacks is currently missing. As a first step towards a better understanding of this field, this paper applies two of these approaches-- FeatureMapper as a representative of declarative approaches and VML* as a representative of operational approaches--to the case study. We show in detail how the case study can be expressed using these approaches and discuss strengths and weaknesses of the two approaches with regard to the case study.},

As most approaches for automated analysis are built upon logic engines, they require having a Boolean logic translation of the variability models. However, the translation of some significant languages to Boolean logic is remarkably non-trivial. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, a translation of the Kconfig language is presented; second, an approach to test the translation for any given model is provided. The proposed translation has been empirically tested with the introduced validation procedure on five open-source projects.},

abstract = {The software product-line approach (for software product families) is one of the success stories of software reuse. When applied, it can result in cost savings and increases in productivity. In addition, in safety-critical systems the approach has the potential for reuse of analysis and testing results, which can lead to a safer system. Nevertheless, there are times when it seems like a product family approach should work when, in fact, there are difficulties in properly defining the boundaries of the product family. In this paper, we draw on our experiences in applying the software product-line approach to a family of mobile robots, a family of flight guidance systems, and a family of cardiac pacemakers, as well as case studies done by others to (1) illustrate how domain structure can currently limit applicability of product-line approaches to certain domains and (2) demonstrate our progress towards a solution using a set-theoretic approach to reason about domains of what we call n-dimensional and hierarchical product families.},

abstract = {Exploring architectural design space is often beyond human capacity and makes architectural design a difficult task. Model-based systems engineering must include assistance to the system designer in identifying candidate architectures to subsequently analyze tradeoffs. Unfortunately, existing languages and approaches do not incorporate this concern, generally favoring solution analysis over exploring a set of candidate architectures.In this paper, we explore the advantages of designing and configuring the variability problem to solve one of the problems of exploring (synthesizing) candidate architectures in systems engineering: the resource allocation problem. More specifically, this work reports on the use of the Clafer modeling language and its gateway to the CSP Choco Solver, on an industrial case study of heterogeneous hardware resource allocation (GPP-GPGPU-FPGA).Based on experiments on the modeling in Clafer, and the impact of its translation into the constraint programming paradigm (performance studies), discussions highlight some issues concerning facilities for modeling and synthesis of architectures and recommendations are proposed towards the use of this variability approach.},

abstract = {The evolution of variant-rich systems is a challenging task. To support developers, the research community has proposed a range of different techniques over the last decades. However, many techniques have not been adopted in practice so far. To advance such techniques and to support their adoption, it is crucial to evaluate them against realistic baselines, ideally in the form of generally accessible benchmarks. To this end, we need to improve our empirical understanding of typical evolution scenarios for variant-rich systems and their relevance for benchmarking. In this paper, we establish eleven evolution scenarios in which benchmarks would be beneficial. Our scenarios cover typical lifecycles of variant-rich system, ranging from clone &amp; own to adopting and evolving a configurable product-line platform. For each scenario, we formulate benchmarking requirements and assess its clarity and relevance via a survey with experts in variant-rich systems and software evolution. We also surveyed the existing benchmarking landscape, identifying synergies and gaps. We observed that most scenarios, despite being perceived as important by experts, are only partially or not at all supported by existing benchmarks-a call to arms for building community benchmarks upon our requirements. We hope that our work raises awareness for benchmarking as a means to advance techniques for evolving variant-rich systems, and that it will lead to a benchmarking initiative in our community.},

abstract = {This PhD project aims to automatically learn transition systems capturing the behaviour of a whole family of software-based systems. Reasoning at the family level yields important economies of scale and quality improvements for a broad range of systems such as software product lines, adaptive and configurable systems. Yet, to fully benefit from the above advantages, a model of the system family's behaviour is necessary. Such a model is often prohibitively expensive to create manually due to the number of variants. For large long-lived systems with outdated specifications or for systems that continuously adapt, the modelling cost is even higher. Therefore, this PhD proposes to automate the learning of such models from existing artefacts. To advance research at a fundamental level, our learning target are Featured Transition Systems (FTS), an abstract formalism that can be used to provide a pivot semantics to a range of variability-aware state-based modelling languages. The main research questions addressed by this PhD project are: (1) Can we learn variability-aware models efficiently? (2) Can we learn FTS in a black-box fashion? (i.e., with access to execution logs but not to source code); (3) Can we learn FTS in a white/grey-box testing fashion? (i.e., with access to source code); and (4) How do the proposed techniques scale in practice?},

abstract = {Product lines are a promising approach to improve conceptually the productivity of the software development process and thus to reduce both the cost and time of developing and maintaining increasingly complex systems. An important issue in the adoption of the product-line approach is the migration of legacy software components, which have not been designed for reuse, systematically into reusable product-line components. This article describes activities performed to improve systematically the design and implementation of an existing software component in order to reuse it in a software product line. The activities are embedded in the application of Fraunhofer PuLSE™-DSSA—an approach for defining domain-specific software architectures (DSSA) and product-line architectures. The component under investigation is the so-called Image Memory Handler (IMH), which is used in Ricoh's current products of office appliances such as copier machines, printers, and multi-functional peripherals. It is responsible for controlling memory usage and compressing and decompressing image data. Improvement of both the component's design and implementation are based on a systematic analysis and focused on increasing maintainability and reusability and hence suitability for use in a product line. As a result of the analysis and refactoring activities, the documentation and implementation of the component has been considerably improved as shown by quantitative data collected at the end of the activities. Despite a number of changes to the code, the external behavior of the component has been preserved without significantly affecting the performance. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.},

The Product-Process-Resource (PPR) approach allows modeling products produced by industrial processes using specific production resources. In practice, a CPPS manufactures a portfolio of product type variants, i.e., a product line. Therefore, engineers need to create and maintain several PPR models to cover PPR variants and their evolving versions. In this paper, we detail a representative use case, identify challenges for using Variability Modeling (VM) methods to describe and manage PPR variants, and present a first solution approach based on cooperation with domain experts at an industry partner, a system integrator of automation for high-performance CPPS. We conclude that integrating basic variability concepts into PPR models is a promising first step and describe our further research plans to support PPR VM in CPPS.},

There exist analyses alternatives such as SAT solving or constraint programming. However, none of them have explored simulation-based methods. Monte Carlo-based decision making is a simulation-based method for dealing with colossal solution spaces using randomness. This paper proposes a conceptual framework that tackles various of those analyses using Monte Carlo methods, which have proven to succeed in vast search spaces (e.g., game theory). Our general framework is described formally, and its flexibility to cope with a diversity of analysis problems is discussed (e.g., finding defective configurations, feature model reverse engineering or getting optimal performance configurations). Additionally, we present a Python implementation of the framework that shows the feasibility of our proposal. With this contribution, we envision that different problems can be addressed using Monte Carlo simulations and that our framework can be used to advance the state of the art a step forward.},

abstract = {A common software product line strategy involves plugin-based web systems that support simple and quick incorporation of custom behaviors. As a result, they have been widely adopted to create web-based applications. Indeed, the popularity of ecosystems that support plugin-based development (e.g., WordPress) is largely due to the number of customization options available as community-contributed plugins. However, plugin-related vulnerabilities tend to be recurrent, exploitable and hard to be detected and may lead to severe consequences for the customized product. Hence, there is a need to further understand such vulnerabilities to enable preventing relevant security threats. Therefore, we conducted an exploratory study to characterize vulnerabilities caused by plugins in web-based systems. To this end, we went over WordPress vulnerability bulletins cataloged by the National Vulnerability Database as well as associated patches maintained by the WordPress plugins repository. We identified the main types of vulnerabilities caused by plugins as well as their impact and the size of the patch to fix the vulnerability. Moreover, we identified the most common security-related topics discussed among WordPress developers. We observed that, while plugin-related vulnerabilities may have severe consequences and might remain unnoticed for years before being fixed, they can commonly be mitigated with small and localized changes to the source code. The characterization helps to provide an understanding on how typical plugin-based vulnerabilities manifest themselves in practice. Such information can be helpful to steer future research on plugin-based vulnerability detection and prevention.},

To deal with the automatic generation of custom-made configurations of web applications, industry usually adopts annotation-based approaches even though the majority of studies encourage the use of composition-based approaches to implement Software Product Lines. Recent work tries to combine both approaches to get the complementary benefits. However, technological companies are reticent to adopt new development paradigms such as feature-oriented programming or aspect-oriented programming. Moreover, it is extremely difficult, or even impossible, to apply these programming models to web applications, mainly because of their multilingual nature, since their development involves multiple types of source code (Java, Groovy, JavaScript), templates (HTML, Markdown, XML), style sheet files (CSS and its variants, such as SCSS), and other files (JSON, YML, shell scripts). We propose to use the Common Variability Language as a composition-based approach and integrate annotations to manage fine grained variability of a Software Product Line for web applications. In this paper, we (i) show that existing composition and annotation-based approaches, including some well-known combinations, are not appropriate to model and implement the variability of web applications; and (ii) present a combined approach that effectively integrates annotations into a composition-based approach for web applications. We implement our approach and show its applicability with an industrial real-world system.},

This paper applies data envelopment analysis (DEA) to find a set of product family mix that is efficient for the company to produce. To ensure long-term effectiveness in productivity and in profit gaining, window analysis is adopted to seek the most recommended set of product family mixes for manufacturing by measuring the performance changes over time. With this method, the performance of a mix in one period is compared not only with the performance of other mixes but also with its own performance in other periods. The proposed mechanism can provide guidance to the fabricator regarding strategies for aggregate planning so as to improve manufacturing efficiency.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) is a promising paradigm for reusing knowledge and artifacts among similar software products. However, SPLE methods and techniques require a high up-front investment and hence are profitable if several similar software products are developed. Thus in practice adoption of SPLE commonly takes a bottom-up approach, in which analyzing the commonality and variability of existing products and transforming them into reusable ones (termed core assets) are needed. These time-consuming and error-prone tasks call for automation. The literature partially deals with solutions for early software development stages, mainly in the form of variability analysis. We aim for further creation of core requirements—reusable requirements that can be adapted for different software products. To this end, we introduce an automated extractive method, named CoreReq, to generate core requirements from product requirements written in a natural language. The approach clusters similar requirements, captures variable parts utilizing natural language processing techniques, and generates core requirements following an ontological variability framework. Focusing on cloning scenarios, we evaluated CoreReq through examples and a controlled experiment. Based on the results, we claim that core requirements generation with CoreReq is feasible and usable for specifying requirements of new similar products in cloning scenarios.},

abstract = {Eclipse OMR is an open-source C++ framework for building robust language runtimes. The OMR toolkit includes a dynamic Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, a garbage collector, a platform abstraction library, and a set of developer tooling capabilities. To support the diverse languages and architectures targeted by the framework, OMR's variability implementation uses a combination of build-system variability and static polymorphism. That is, all implementation classes that depend on the selected language and architecture are decided at compile time. However, OMR developers now realize that the current variability design decision, specifically the static polymorphism implementation, has its drawbacks. They are considering using dynamic polymorphism instead of static polymorphism. Before making such a fundamental design change, however, it is crucial to collect function information and overload/override statistics about the current variability in the code base.In this paper, we present OMRStatistics, a static analysis tool that we built for OMR developers to help them collect this information. Specifically, OMRStatistics (1) visualizes the class hierarchy from OMR's current static polymorphic implementation, (2) visualizes the function overloads and overrides with their respective locations in the source code, (3) collects important information about the classes and functions, and (4) stores all the collected information in a database for further analysis. Our tool OMRStatistics allows OMR developers to make better design decisions on which variability extension points should be switched from static polymorphism to dynamic polymorphism.},

abstract = {Feature and variability extraction from different artifacts is an indispensable activity to support systematic integration of single software systems and Software Product Line (SPL). Beyond manually extracting variability, a variety of approaches, such as feature location in source code and feature extraction in requirements, has been proposed to provide an automatic identification of features and their variation points. Compared with source code, requirements contain more complete variability information and provide traceability links to other artifacts from early development phases. In this paper, we propose a method to automatically extract features and relationships based on a probabilistic relevance and word embedding. In particular, our technique consists of three steps: First, we apply word2vec to obtain a prediction model, which we use to determine the word level similarity of requirements. Second, based on word level similarity and the significance of a word in a domain, we compute the requirements level similarity using probabilistic relevance. Third, we adopt hierarchical clustering to group features and we define four criteria to detect variation points between identified features. We perform a case study to evaluate the usability and robustness of our method and to compare it with the results of other related approaches. Initial results reveal that our approach identifies the majority of features correctly and also extracts variability information with reasonable accuracy.},

abstract = {A software product line is a family of software products that share a common set of mandatory features and whose individual products are differentiated by their variable (optional or alternative) features. Family-based analysis of software product lines takes as input a single model of a complete product line and analyzes all its products at the same time. As the number of products in a software product line may be large, this is generally preferable to analyzing each product on its own. Family-based analysis, however, requires that standard algorithms be adapted to accomodate variability.In this paper we adapt the standard algorithm for computing limit average cost of a weighted transition system to software product lines. Limit average is a useful and popular measure for the long-term average behavior of a quality attribute such as performance or energy consumption, but has hitherto not been available for family-based analysis of software product lines. Our algorithm operates on weighted featured transition systems, at a symbolic level, and computes limit average cost for all products in a software product line at the same time. We have implemented the algorithm and evaluated it on several examples.},

abstract = {Within software product lines, customers may have different quality needs. To produce products with purposefully different quality attributes, several challenges must be addressed. First, one must be able to distinguish product quality attributes to the customers in a meaningful way. Second, one must create the desired quality attribute differences during product-line architecture design and derivation. To study how performance is varied purposefully in software product lines, we conducted a comparison and re-analysis of two industrial case studies in the telecommunication and mobile game domains. The results show that performance variants must be communicated to the customer in a way that links to customer value and her role. When performance or its adaptation are crucial for the customer, performance differences must be explicitly "designed in" with software or hardware means. Due to the emergent nature of performance, it is important to test performance and manage how other variability affects performance.},

abstract = {In a software product line similar products are derived based on a common foundation. With traditional methods a number of similar products exist independently. To derive a maintainable, reusable set of software components it is necessary to understand similarities and differences. However, an adequate similarity analysis involving several products is a cost-intensive and difficult task, compromising the pursued benefit. In this paper an automated syntactical similarity analysis for software component interfaces is proposed to support the software product line extraction and maintenance. We apply this general approach specifically to the automotive domain, as the static nature of the architecture and the high number of well-defined signals makes the interfaces especially expressive. The analysis supports three use cases: the identification of similarities between two interfaces, the automated extraction of a common interface for a set of interfaces and the evaluation of interface changes during the evolution history of a software component. In addition the syntactical analysis provides the foundation for further semantical examinations. Its applicability is indicated by a case study on different variants and versions of interfaces defined in an industrial context.},

This variety causes overhead to researchers and practitioners as they frequently need to translate models. The MODEVAR initiative consists of dozens of researchers and aims to find a unified language for variability modeling. In this work, we describe the cooperative development of a textual variability language. We evaluate preferences of the community regarding properties of existing formats and applications for an initial design of a unified variability language. Then, we examine the acceptance of the community for our proposal. The results indicate that our proposal is a promising start towards a unified variability language instead of yet another language. We envision that the community applies our language proposal in teaching, research prototypes, and industrial applications to further evolve the design and then ultimately reach a unified language.},

In these fields, the strong domain orientation leads to the need to manage interrelated SPLs and multiple instances of configured sub-products, resulting in complex configurations that cannot be easily represented by simple sets of features. In this paper we propose a tooled approach to manage such SPLs through a domain model that interrelates several feature models in a consistent way. The approach thus shifts part of the domain knowledge to the problem space and supports the derivation of complex configurations with multiple instantiations and associations of sub-products. We also report on the application of our approach to an industrial-strength software development in the field of digital signage.},

The proposed approach mainly addresses “Reflective Aspect” and “Reflective Rule” patterns for the seamless integration of Aurora and RUMBA. Both architectural patterns introduce a “generative” approach for developing the basic aspects, dynamic rules and rule-sets so that all can be implemented in the Adaptive Object Model (AOM). The proposed model will be explained in detail and exemplified with existing projects using both Aurora and RUMBA approaches.},

Hence, techniques for modeling and analyzing time-critical software have to be lifted to software product line engineering, too. Existing approaches extend timed automata (TA) by feature constraints to so-called featured timed automata (FTA) facilitating efficient verification of real-time properties for entire product lines in a single run. In this paper, we propose a novel modeling formalism, called configurable parametric timed automata (CoPTA), extending expressiveness of FTA by supporting freely configurable and therefore a-priori unbounded timing intervals for real-time constraints, which are defined as feature attributes in extended feature models with potentially infinite configuration spaces. We further describe an efficient test-suite generation methodology for CoPTA models, achieving location coverage on every possible model configuration. Finally, we present evaluation results gained from applying our tool implementation to a collection of case studies, demonstrating efficiency improvements compared to a variant-by-variant analysis.},

abstract = {The term bug prevalence is derived from the medical world vocabulary and applied to Software Product Line (SPL), meaning all products that are affected by one particular bug. In single systems development, this concept is not relevant since a bug is either present or not. However, when it comes to SPL, analyzing the bug prevalence of a certain bug is still a challenge and a highly relevant topic, since the same bug may be present in several products. To support this analysis, the main contribution of this paper is the Product Genealogy approach. A core concept in our approach is the Product Genealogy Tree, in which the hierarchy of products in the SPL is represented, reflecting how each product evolved or was derived from another or from the core assets. In this context, the benefit of such a tree is the rapid visualization of the product's structure in the SPL, providing input on which products are to be examined initially. Besides that, in this paper we introduce a novel analogy between the medical genetics world and SPL in order to better explain the principles of our approach.},

abstract = {Self-adaptive systems (SAS) are exceptional systems, on account of their versatile composition, dynamic behavior and evolutive nature. Existing formal languages for the specification of SAS focus on adapting system elements to achieve a target goal, following specific rules, without much attention on the adaptation of requirements themselves. The State-Constraint Transition (SCT) modeling language enables the specification of dynamic requirements, both at the domain and application level, as a result of space or time variability. This language, evaluated in this paper, enables the specification of a variety of requirement types, for SASs from different domains, while generating a configuration, all configurations, and number of possible configurations, in milliseconds. This paper presents these results, namely; expressiveness, domain independence and scalability, from the viewpoint of designers and domain engineers, following a goal-question-metric approach. However, being primarily based on constraint programming (CP), the language suffers from drawbacks inherited from this paradigm, specifically time related requirements, like (e.g. order, frequency and staged requirements).},

In general, an FTS may contain featured transitions that are unreachable in any product (so called dead transitions) or, on the contrary, mandatorily present in all products for which their source state is reachable (so called false optional transitions), as well as states from which only for certain products progress is possible (so called hidden deadlocks). In this paper, we provide algorithms to analyse an FTS for such ambiguities and to transform an ambiguous FTS into an unambiguous FTS. The scope of our approach is twofold. First and foremost, an ambiguous model is typically undesired as it gives an unclear idea of the SPL. Second, an unambiguous FTS paves the way for efficient family-based model checking. We apply our approach to illustrative examples from the literature.},

abstract = {Incremental satisfiability (SAT) solving is an extension of classic SAT solving that allows users to efficiently solve a set of related SAT problems by identifying and exploiting shared terms. However, using incremental solvers effectively is hard since performance is sensitive to a problem's structure and the order sub-terms are fed to the solver, and the burden to track results is placed on the end user. For analyses that generate sets of related SAT problems, such as those in software product lines, incremental SAT solvers are either not used at all, used but not explicitly stated so in the literature, or used but suffer from the aforementioned usability problems. This paper translates the ordering problem to an encoding problem and automates the use of incremental SAT solving. We introduce variational SAT solving, which differs from incremental SAT solving by accepting all related problems as a single variational input and returning all results as a single variational output. Our central idea is to make explicit the operations of incremental SAT solving, thereby encoding differences between related SAT problems as local points of variation. Our approach automates the interaction with the incremental solver and enables methods to automatically optimize sharing of the input. To evaluate our methods we construct a prototype variational SAT solver and perform an empirical analysis on two real-world datasets that applied incremental solvers to software evolution scenarios. We show, assuming a variational input, that the prototype solver scales better for these problems than naive incremental solving while also removing the need to track individual results.},

abstract = {Systems are typically not developed from scratch, so different kinds of similarities between them exist, challenging their maintenance and future development. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) proposes methods and techniques for developing reusable artifacts that can be systematically reused in similar systems. Despite the potential benefits of SPLE to decrease time-to-market and increase product quality, it requires a high up-front investment and hence SPLE techniques are commonly adopted in a bottom-up approach, after individual systems have already been developed. Deciding whether to turn existing systems into a product line – referred to as product line-ability – involves many aspects and requires some tooling for analyzing similarities and differences among systems. In this paper we propose a framework for the identification of “similarly behaving” artifacts and analyzing their potential reuse in the context of product lines. This framework provides metrics for calculating behavior similarity and a method for analyzing the product line-ability of a set of products. The framework has been integrated into a tool named VarMeR – Variability Mechanisms Recommender, whose aim is to systematically guide reuse.},

abstract = {Dealing with variability, during Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE), means trying to allow software engineers to develop a set of similar applications based on a manageable range of variable functionalities according to expert users’ needs. Particularly, variability management (VM) is an activity that allows flexibility and a high level of reuse during software development. In the last years, we have witnessed a proliferation of methods, techniques and supporting tools for VM in general, and for its analysis in particular. More precisely, a specific field has emerged, named (automated) variability analysis, focusing on verifying variability models across the SPLE’s phases. In this paper, we introduce a systematic literature review of existing proposals (as primary studies) focused on analyzing variability models. We define a classification framework, which is composed of 20 sub-characteristics addressing general aspects, such as scope and validation, as well as model-specific aspects, such as variability primitives, reasoner type. The framework allows to look at the analysis of variability models during its whole life cycle—from design to derivation—according to the activities involved during an SPL development. Also, the framework helps us answer three research questions defined for showing the state of the art and drawing challenges for the near future. Among the more interesting challenges, we can highlight the needs of more applications in industry, the existence of more mature tools, and the needs of providing more semantics in the way of variability primitives for identifying inconsistencies in the models.},

As context, the toolset product line was intended for integration of expert knowledge into a family of industrial asset health applications at runtime. The toolset architecture is now being evolved to build and manage plugins for multiple Industrial Analytics solutions (software systems and services) beyond asset health. This evolution is driving changes in the desired architecture qualities of the toolset; widening the stakeholder pool and influencing priorities; affecting the architecture tradeoffs and decisions; and triggering updates to the product line architecture, the guidance for applying it, and the current prototype of the toolset. We describe our experiences in handling this evolution, assess lessons learned, and discuss potential relevance to other product line scenarios.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) paradigm aims to explore commonalities and variabilities in a set of applications for developing an efficient derivation of products. One of the most common ways to model variability in this paradigm is to use a Feature Model. However, variability in SPL is often limited to functional features. The User Interface (UI) variations are modeled as entire UIs and thus these variations are not reusable and inspectable. Research in the Human Computer Interaction (HCI) field has proven the importance of variability for non functional, purely UI centric features. The HCI community has proposed several levels of abstraction for multi-context UI design. Indeed, new variations can be introduced at each abstraction level. UI designers are used to them and they usually introduce variability at each step of the UI definition without using SPL. To build usable softwares that take into account UI, we propose to merge functional concerns and UI concerns, providing a methodology to integrate variability of both aspects into a single Feature Model.},

We identified two popular modeling paradigms: Feature-oriented domain modeling (FODM) and domain specific modeling (DSM). The appropriate choice of the modeling paradigm is a crucial decision for the development of an efficient and easy to use domain model. For complex and heterogeneous domain descriptions, for example embedded system descriptions, different representation techniques can be useful to describe the different parts of the system. We propose a method to combine both representation techniques to realize a domain specific multi modeling approach. This supports not only a more natural domain description, but can as well be seen as a support for knowledge transfer between different stakeholders.},

In this paper, we propose an MDE method for HISes that goes beyond MDA. This method seeks a higher degree of maintainability and reuse by adhering to three main principles: transversalization of data models and architecture models, dualization of information and clinical data models, and stylization of architecture models. To support this method on the generation of HIS skeletons, we are progressing work on the development of a software product line called SPLiCE (Software Product Line for healthCarE) that weaves together clinical data models described according to the openEHR specifications and architecture models specified in the Acme language.},

The software products within the software ecosystem typically have a common technological platform, and consist of a keystone player at the center of the ecosystem with niche players addressing market segments the keystone player would otherwise not have access to.Stakeholder identification is critical to the financial and functional success of software development projects, however the task of identifying all stakeholders in a SECO is often not possible due to the high volume of stakeholders and open interfaces. The identification of key stakeholders should ensure that the most relevant requirements are elicited during a software planning cycle.The objective of this research is to examine how key stakeholders can be identified in complex SECOs. This research takes a design science approach and the main component of the current research is the design of an artifact in the form of a reference process model, that is applied in a real-world environment to develop a business process model. Consequently, this research aims to facilitate academia and industry in SECO optimization, especially from a requirements management perspective.},

abstract = {Software is often released in multiple variants to address the needs of different customers or application scenarios. One frequent approach to create new variants is clone-and-own, whose systematic support has gained considerable research interest in the last decade. However, only few techniques have been evaluated in a realistic setting, due to a substantial lack of publicly available clone-and-own projects which could be used as experimental subjects. Instead, many studies use variants generated from software product lines for their evaluation. Unfortunately, the results might be biased, because variants generated from a single code base lack unintentional divergences that would have been introduced by clone-and-own. In this paper, we report about ongoing work towards a more systematic investigation of threats to the external validity of such experimental results. Using n-way model matching as a representative technique for supporting clone-and-own, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on variant sets exposing increasing degrees of divergence. We compile our observations into four hypotheses which are meant to serve as a basis for discussion and which need to be investigated in more detail in future research.},

abstract = {Performance is an important non functional quality attribute of a software system. The ability to deliver the expected performance objectives comes from a careful design and attention to detail. Unfortunately, performance is not always considered at the beginning. However, once built, software performance can still be improved by evaluating and tuning the software architecture. When analyzing the performance of a software product family, an understanding of its architectural properties is needed. A software product family architecture's strength is based on common assets, platforms and source code shared by its family members. Software product family design allows improved time-to-market, software quality and software reuse. At the same time, variability is the factor to instantiate different products and the handling of the variation points must be carefully managed. In this paper I present a scenario-driven approach for analyzing the performance of software product family architectures. The process of performance tuning has been applied to a Nokia software product family architecture and two case studies are presented. The evaluation process and the tradeoffs of evaluating software product family architectures are discussed.},

abstract = {Configuration is a key enabling technology for the engineering of systems and software as wells as physical goods. A selection of configuration options (aka. features) is often enough to automatically generate a product tailored to the needs of a customer. It is common that not all combinations of features are possible in a given domain. Feature modeling is the de-facto standard for specifying features and their valid combinations. However, a pivotal hurdle for practitioners, researchers, and teachers in applying feature modeling is that there are hundreds of tools and languages available. While there have been first attempts to define a standard feature modeling language, they still struggle with finding an appropriate level of expressiveness. If the expressiveness is too high, the language will not be adopted, as it is too much effort to support all language constructs. If the expressiveness is too low, the language will not be adopted, as many interesting domains cannot be modeled in such a language. Towards a standard feature modeling notation, we propose the use of language levels with different expressiveness each and discuss criteria to be used to define such language levels. We aim to raise the awareness on the expressiveness and eventually contribute to a standard feature modeling notation.},

abstract = {Software Product Line engineering aims at reusing and automating software development to reduce costs, have shorter development cycles, and maintain quality. However, for organizations with settled development processes and a large code base, adopting an SPL approach may prove to be a daunting task. In this paper we present an industrial experimentation and a proposal for an SPL adoption in Heinsohn Business Technology (HBT), a software development company specialized in financial, transportation, mortgage-backed securities, and pension-fund solutions. We start by identifying and modeling multiple levels of variability inherent to the kind of developments undertaken by HBT. Next, we define restrictions inside every level as well as between the levels to fully characterize an HBT software product. To limit the impact on the organization development process, we use an extractive approach. This allows us to design core assets starting from current software artifacts. The overall approach is based on real-world software artifacts developed over the years by HBT, whose combinations result in approximately 4.88e11 possible product configurations.},

abstract = {Much activity within software product line engineering has been concerned with explicitly representing and exploiting commonality and variability at the feature level for the purpose of a particular engineering task e.g. requirements specification, design, coding, verification, product derivation process, but not for comparing how similar products in the product line are with each other. In contrast, a case-based approach to software development is concerned with descriptions and models as a set of software cases stored in a repository for the purpose of searching at a product level, typically as a foundation for new product development. New products are derived by finding the most similar product descriptions in the repository using similarity metrics.The new idea is to use such similarity metrics for mining variability from software repositories. In this sense, software product line engineering could be informed by the case-based approach. This approach requires defining and implementing such similarity metrics based on the representations used for the software cases in such a repository. It provides complementary benefits to the ones given through feature-based representations of variability and may help mining such variability.},

T-wise sampling is one method of finding a representative subset of configurations for a system, which can then be tested. However, for large-scale systems, such as Linux, existing t-wise sampling algorithms do not scale well. To this end, Pett et al. proposed the sampling challenge for large-scale systems at SPLC 2019.

Any given approach for software product lines will likely lead to both positive and negative consequences during unanticipated software evolution. Unfortunately, we know little about the evolvability characteristics of SPL approaches that concern both modelling and implementation, limiting our ability to make rational and disciplined decisions about adoption. We conduct a case study into the unanticipated evolution of a software product family using two approaches: separate products versus a common codebase using delta-oriented programming (DOP). We compare the ease of change within the two versions through a set of quantitative measurements and qualitative observations. We find that both versions have strengths and weaknesses: complexity and incomplete support from DOP tools versus significant duplication and error-proneness in the separate products.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) have recently shown promising potentials as integrated engineering methodology for (self-)adaptive software systems. Based on the software-configuration principles of software product lines, DSPL additionally foster reconfiguration capabilities to continuously adapt software products to ever-changing environmental contexts. However, in most recent works concerned with finding near-optimal reconfiguration decisions, real-time aspects of reconfiguration processes are usually out of scope. In this paper, we present a model-based methodology for specifying and automatically analyzing real-time constraints of reconfiguration decisions in a feature-oriented and compositional way. Those real-time aware DSPL specifications are internally translated into timed automata, a well-founded formalism for real-time behaviors. This representation allows for formally reasoning about consistency and worst-case/best-case execution-time behaviors of sequences of reconfiguration decisions. The technique is implemented in a prototype tool and experimentally evaluated with respect to a set of case studies1.},

abstract = {Product-line architectures (PLAs) are an emerging paradigm for developing software families for distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems by customizing reusable artifacts, rather than hand-crafting software from scratch. To reduce the effort of developing software PLAs and product variants for DRE systems, developers are applying general-purpose -- ideally standard -- middleware platforms whose reusable services and mechanisms support a range of application quality of service (QoS) requirements, such as low latency and jitter. The generality and flexibility of standard middleware, however, often results in excessive time/space overhead for DRE systems, due to lack of optimizations tailored to meet the specific QoS requirements of different product variants in a PLA.This paper provides the following contributions to the study of middleware specialization techniques for PLA-based DRE systems. First, we identify key dimensions of generality in standard middleware stemming from framework implementations, deployment platforms, and middleware standards. Second, we illustrate how context-specific specialization techniques can be automated and used to tailor standard middleware to better meet the QoS needs of different PLA product variants. Third, we quantify the benefits of applying automated tools to specialize a standard Realtime CORBA middleware implementation. When applied together, these middleware specializations improved our application product variant throughput by ~65%, average- and worst-case end-to-end latency measures by ~43% and ~45%, respectively, and predictability by a factor of two over an already optimized middleware implementation, with little or no effect on portability, standard middleware APIs, or application software implementations, and interoperability.},

abstract = {In a Software Product Line (SPL), the central notion of implementability provides the requisite connection between specifications (feature sets) and their implementations (component sets), leading to the definition of products. While it appears to be a simple extension (to sets) of the trace-ability relation between components and features, it actually involves several subtle issues which are overlooked in the definitions in existing literature. In this paper, we give a precise and formal definition of implementability over a fairly expressive traceability relation to solve these issues. The consequent definition of products in the given SPL naturally entails a set of useful analysis problems that are either refinements of known problems, or are completely novel. We also propose a new approach to solve these analysis problems by encoding them as Quantified Boolean Formula(QBF) and solving them through Quantified Satisfiability (QSAT) solvers. The methodology scales much better than the SAT-based solutions hinted in the literature and is demonstrated through a prototype tool called SPLANE (SPL Analysis Engine), on a couple of fairly large case studies.},

abstract = {Several relevant analyses on configurable software systems remain intractable because they require examining vast and highly-constrained configuration spaces. Those analyses could be addressed through statistical inference, i.e., working with a much more tractable sample that later supports generalizing the results obtained to the entire configuration space. To make this possible, the laws of statistical inference impose an indispensable requirement: each member of the population must be equally likely to be included in the sample, i.e., the sampling process needs to be "uniform". Various SAT-samplers have been developed for generating uniform random samples at a reasonable computational cost. Unfortunately, there is a lack of experimental validation over large configuration models to show whether the samplers indeed produce genuine uniform samples or not. This paper (i) presents a new statistical test to verify to what extent samplers accomplish uniformity and (ii) reports the evaluation of four state-of-the-art samplers: Spur, QuickSampler, Unigen2, and Smarch. According to our experimental results, only Spur satisfies both scalability and uniformity.},

Data collection has been organized by product release. The original goal of this research is to study the economic impact of market reposition on the product line and identify metrics that can be used to records changes in product line. We later look at the product line evolution vis-a-vis the changes in the products that form the product line. Our results show that there is no relationship between the size of the code added to the product line and the number of designers required to develop and test it; and there is a positive relationship between designer turnover and impact of change.},

Regretfully, the community still faces issues and challenges to port or share variability models among tools and methodological approaches. There are researchers, for instance, implementing the same algorithms and analyses again because they use a specific modeling language and cannot use some existing tool. This paper introduces the High-Level Variability Language (HLVL), an expressive and extensible textual language that can be used as a modeling and an intermediate language for variability. HLVL was designed following an ontological approach, i.e., by defining their elements considering the meaning of the concepts existing on different variability languages. Our proposal not only provides a unified language based on a comprehensive analysis of the existing ones but also sets foundations to build tools that support different notations and their combination.},

abstract = {Control software for automated production systems (aPs) becomes increasingly complex as it evolves due to changing requirements. To address varying customer demands or altered regulatory guidelines, it is common practice to create a new system variant by copying and subsequently modifying existing control software. Referred to as clone-and-own, proper documentation is typically not cherished, thereby entailing severe maintenance issues in the long-run. To mitigate such problems and to reinstate sustainable development, respective software systems need to be compared and their variability information needs to be reverse-engineered. However, recent work identified variability management in the domain of aPs to remain a challenging endevour and appropriate tool support to be missing.We bridge this gap and introduce the Variability Analysis Toolkit (VAT), an extensible platform that allows for the customizable definition of metrics to compare IEC61131-3 control software variants as well as providing means to visualize results. The VAT facilitates a working environment that allows for the exchange of produced results between users. By that, we aim to support engineers in re-engineering control software systems by providing them with means to define metrics based on their individual demands. We demonstrate the feasibility of the VAT using 24 software system variants implemented in accordance to the IEC61131-3 standard.},

To this end, we view CNNs as configurable systems and propose an end-to-end framework that allows the configuration, evaluation and automated search for CNN architectures. Therefore, our contribution is threefold. First, we model the variability of CNN architectures with a Feature Model (FM) that generalizes over existing architectures. Each valid configuration of the FM corresponds to a valid CNN model that can be built and trained. Second, we implement, on top of Tensorflow, an automated procedure to deploy, train and evaluate the performance of a configured model. Third, we propose a method to search for configurations and demonstrate that it leads to good CNN models. We evaluate our method by applying it on image classification tasks (MNIST, CIFAR-10) and show that, with limited amount of computation and training, our method can identify high-performing architectures (with high accuracy). We also demonstrate that we outperform existing state-of-the-art architectures handcrafted by ML researchers. Our FM and framework have been released to support replication and future research.},

abstract = {The notion of features is commonly used to describe the functional and non-functional characteristics of a system. In software product line engineering, features often become the prime entities of software reuse and are used to distinguish the individual products of a product line. Properly decomposing a product line into features, and correctly using features in all engineering phases, is core to the immediate and long-term success of such a system. Yet, although more than ten different definitions of the term feature exist, it is still a very abstract concept. Definitions lack concrete guidelines on how to use the notion of features in practice.To address this gap, we present a qualitative empirical study on actual feature usage in industry. Our study covers three large companies and an in-depth, contextualized analysis of 23 features, perceived by the interviewees as typical, atypical (outlier), good, or bad representatives of features. Using structured interviews, we investigate the rationales that lead to a feature's perception, and identify and analyze core characteristics (facets) of these features. Among others, we find that good features precisely describe customer-relevant functionality, while bad features primarily arise from rashly executed processes. Outlier features, serving unusual purposes, are necessary, but do not require the full engineering process of typical features.},

However, it faces a typical efficiency issue as it can produce many mutants that are equivalent to the original system, making it impossible to generate test cases from them.We consider this problem when model-based mutation testing is applied to real-time system product lines, represented as timed automata. We define novel, time-specific mutation operators and formulate the equivalent mutant problem in the frame of timed refinement relations.Further, we study in which cases a mutation yields an equivalent mutant. Our theoretical results provide guidance to system engineers, allowing them to eliminate mutations from which no test case can be produced. Our evaluation, based on a proof-of-concept tool and an industrial case from the automotive domain, confirms the validity of our theory and demonstrates that our approach can eliminate many of the equivalent mutants (88% in our case study).},

The SaaS service adaptation has not only to be according to the functional requirements of the different tenants, but it has also to cope with the non-functional requirements in their various levels that are subject to change in time and space: i.e. within the same tenant and between tenants, respectively. For example, a tenant can just require minimal security level as it needs solely to be authenticated and has no other security concerns; while another may require a high security level and advanced and supplementary security mechanisms such as access control and encryption. There are also situations when the same tenant changes its desired quality level through time; for instance, when there is an increase of service requests in a critical period, the tenant may want to decrease the response time and to increase the uptime value in order to smoothly perform his requests. Therefore, the application needs to be adapted dynamically in order to meet every tenant's quality requirements as if he is the only one to consume the service.Software Product Lines Engineering (SPLE) has largely tackled the variability management field in the literature. It enables high reusability in shorter time, at lower costs and with higher quality by creating product families or lines that share commonalities and have variation points. The derivation of the final product is performed at the level of those variation points while considering the inter-and intra- dependencies between the artifacts of a product line.Our proposed approach is based on the SPLE principles to build SaaS services tailored to tenant-specific Service Level Agreements (SLAs). We defined the Domain Engineering phase to build SLA families. Based on domain analysis, the non-functional requirements of the tenants, their commonalities, variation points and variants are captured and modeled. A Generic SLA is generated which contains the terms and the Service Level Objectives (SLOs) of all the contracting tenants. From this Generic SLA, the proposed middleware generates core and tenant-specific policies. The Configurator, a middleware component, adapts the application according to these defined policies based on annotations in the form of key-value pairs.As contributions of our article [1]: we proposed the architecture of the proposed middleware and its different components; we defined the Policy metamodel, that models policies retrieved from the Generic SLA as annotations, and described the model-to-model transformations from VariableSLA metamodel to Policy metamodel; and we proposeed a Configurator metamodel that models and describes how the Configurator component of the middleware configures the SaaS service.Our approach differs from the literature in that it enables building a family of SLAs: a generic SLA and tenant-specific policies; linking, thus, the non-functional variability with the SLA. Moreover, it is not limited to a specific quality attribute but supports any quality attribute expressed in the SLA. It allows configurations at design time and at runtime through annotating the SaaS service components with adequate quality levels.},

abstract = {We report here an industrial application of the Product Line Engineering (PLE) for the development of electronic braking systems.The cost of software engineering in automotive control systems is increasing as new functions for safety, comfort, and improved fuel efficiency are integrated into electronic control units.Therefore, Component suppliers for automotive control systems adapt their products to the requirements of car manufacturers by modifying the software specifications, such that it makes minimal changes to the mechanical structure and the electrical and electronic (E/E) components hence reduces the cost. PLE is an effective approach to manage or even reduce the software variations resulting from these modifications.However, one problem is that the software specifications of automotive control systems need to be redesigned after system testing with vehicles. This is because vehicles consist of many mechanical parts manufactured by different suppliers, and the characteristics of the parts can interact with each other. This problem makes it difficult to reap the full benefits of PLE.We propose an approach to analyze the potential impact from such interactions by using a system model that expresses the system architecture that includes the parts of different suppliers. Based on this model, the software architecture was designed to localize the impact to several software components. Additionally, a feature model was designed to the enable management of the localized impact by expressing it as variability. This method helps software engineers specify the software components that can have an effect on the actual equipment, and determine which modifications to the software specifications are necessary.We applied PLE with the proposed method in the development of electronic brake control system. We confirmed that our approach greatly increased the efficiency of PLE for the development of such automotive control systems.},

As observed by some authors, the derivation of a product from product line shared core assets has been insufficiently addressed and can remain tedious in practice. We cope with this issue focusing on having a flexible and reactive model-based derivation, and propose an incremental evolution by extension of the product line coupled with this derivation activity. Process and tools bridge the gap between Application and Domain Engineering introducing a semi-automatic feedback to benefits from the developments made in the Application Engineering. The approach is applied to a model-based product line dedicated to Class diagrams, and is tooled within the Eclipse environment.},

abstract = {Features are typically used to describe the functionalities of software systems. They help understanding systems as well as planning their evolution and managing systems. Especially agile methods foster their use. However, to use features, their locations need to be known. When not documented, they are easily forgotten and then need to be recovered, which is costly. While automated feature-location techniques exist, they are not usable in practice given their inaccuracies. We take a different route and advocate to record locations early using a lightweight annotation system, where feature information is embedded in software assets. However, given the potential design space of annotations, a unified notation and tool support is needed. Extending our prior work, we present a unified, concise notation for embedded annotations, which we implemented in FAXE, a library for parsing and retrieving such annotations, use-able in third-party tooling. We demonstrate its use, especially for an advanced use case of feature-oriented isolated development by automating partial commits.},

abstract = {In the future, safety-critical industrial products will have to be maintained and variants will have to be produced. In order to do this economically, the safety artifacts of the components should also be reused. At present, however, it is still unclear how this reuse could take place. Moreover this reuse is complicated, by the different situations in the various industries involved and by the corresponding standards applied.Current industrial practice for certification processes relies on a component-based view of reuse. We investigate the possibilities of product lines with managed processes for reuse also across multiple domains.In order to identify the challenges and possible solutions, we conducted interviews with industry partners from the domains of ICT, Rail, Automotive, and Industrial Automation, and from small- and medium-sized enterprises to large organizations. The semi-structured interviews identified the characteristics of current safety engineering processes, the handling of general variety and reuse, the approach followed for safety artifacts, and the need for improvement.In addition, a detailed literature survey summarizes existing approaches. We investigate which modularity concepts exist for dealing with safety, how variability concepts integrate safety, by which means process models can consider safety, and how safety cases are evolved while maintenance takes place. An overview of similar research projects complements the analysis.The identified challenges and potential solution proposals show how safety is related to Software Product Lines.},

Various processes for evaluating and selecting components and COTS during system design and implementation have been proposed.In this paper we discuss the shortcomings of existing component/COTS selection processes. In contrast to all existing COTS selection processes, we argue that three important facets have to be considered when selecting a COTS for a product family, namely: -- the variability to be offered by the product family, -- the architectural concerns and -- the functional and quality requirements defined for the product family.We discuss the interplay between the component/COTS selection process and the three facets and sketch our selection process CoVAR (Component selection considering Variability, Architectural concerns, and Requirements) which considers all three facets.},

The speed offered by Agile Software Development is needed for short time to market, while reuse strategies such as Software Product Line Engineering are needed for long-term productivity, efficiency, and profit. The paper investigates, through a survey, communication factors affecting both speed and reuse in 3 large companies developing embedded systems and employing Agile Software Development and Software Product Line Engineering. Our results include a prioritized list of communication related factors obtained by statistical analysis and the recognition and spread of the factors in the companies. We have recognized 5 interfaces with the Agile development team that need to be improved: system engineers (architects), product management, distributed teams, inter-project teams and sales unit. Few factors (involving inter-project communication) depend on the business drivers for the company. We also reveal that Agile teams need strategic and architectural inputs in order to be implanted in a large company employing Software Product Line Engineering. Academic and industrial training as well as different tactics for co-location would improve the communication skills of engineers. There is also a need for solutions, in the reference architecture, for fostering Agile Software Development: the goal is the combination of the focus on customer value of the teams, reusability, system requirements and avoidance of organizational dependencies.},

abstract = {Software errors are a major nuisance in software development and can lead not only to reputation damages, but also to considerable financial losses for companies. Therefore, numerous techniques for predicting software defects, largely based on machine learning methods, have been developed over the past decades. These techniques usually rely on code and process metrics in order to predict defects at the granularity of typical software assets, such as subsystems, components, and files. In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation of feature-oriented defect prediction: the prediction of defects at the granularity of features---domain-oriented entities abstractly representing (and often cross-cutting) typical software assets. Feature-oriented prediction can be beneficial, since: (i) particular features might be more error-prone than others, (ii) characteristics of features known as defective might be useful to predict other error-prone features, (iii) feature-specific code might be especially prone to faults arising from feature interactions. We present a dataset derived from 12 software projects and introduce two metric sets for feature-oriented defect prediction. We evaluated seven machine learning classifiers with three different attribute sets each, using our two new metric sets as well as an existing metric set from the literature. We observe precision and recall values of around 85% and better robustness when more diverse metrics sets with richer feature information are used.},

abstract = {Often product lines are applied to "stable domains" (i.e., a set of common features is identifiable in advance and the evolution of the domain is manageable during the lifetime of the product line). These prerequisites are not always given. But there may be market pressure that requires developing products with systematic and preplanned reuse in a domain that is difficult to grasp. In such a case the product line approach also offers a set of methods that helps to overcome the risks of an immature domain.In this paper we discuss some risks in context of immature domains. For some challenges we present approaches to manage them. The considerations are substantiated by experiences in the domain of entertainment and infotainment systems in an automotive context. The development is deeply influenced by technological changes (e.g., Internet, MP3-player, UMTS) that challenge the successful deployment of product line technology.},

abstract = {The annotation-based variability of the C preprocessor (CPP) has a bad reputation regarding comprehensibility and maintainability of software systems, but is widely adopted in practice. To assess the complexity of such systems' variability, several analysis techniques and metrics have been proposed in scientific communities. While most metrics seem reasonable at first glance, they do not generalize over all possible usages of C preprocessor variability that appear in practice. Consequently, some analyses may neglect the actual complexity of variability in these systems and may not properly reflect the real situation. In this paper, we investigate two types of variation points, namely negating and #else directives, to which we refer to as corner cases, as they are seldom explicitly considered in research. To investigate these directives, we rely on three commonly used metrics: lines of feature code, scattering degree, and tangling degree. We (1) describe how the considered directives impact these metrics, (2) unveil the resulting differences within 19 systems, and (3) propose how to address the arising issues. The results show that the corner cases appear regularly in variable feature code and can heavily change the results obtained with established metrics. We argue that we need to refine metrics and improve variability analysis techniques to provide more precise results, but we also need to reason about the meaning of corner cases and metrics.},

abstract = {Danfoss Power Electronics is a centre with both extensive power electronics know-how and many competencies within frequency converters and solar inverters. Development of embedded controllers built in Danfoss products raises similar challenges found in many other companies: creation of product series with an increasing number of variants, while at the same time decreasing time-to-market and keeping development costs low. Introduction of a Software Product Line approach into product development is a challenge that Danfoss Power Electronics decided to take in order to reduce software development efforts few years ago. The approach has been successful allowing for development of a number of highly engineered products. However, the software product line is in a constant evolution. It grows over time as new functionality is added in the form of extra software artefacts and further products are configured from it. As a result, the overall complexity and maintenance of assets hinders further efficiency of the approach. This paper presents extension of the variability management that goes beyond the scope of software assets reuse previously introduced into the organization. A prototype of the technique linking multi-level variability management is further elaborated using pure::variants.},

abstract = {In certain domains, safety-critical software systems may remain operational for decades. To comply with changing requirements, new system variants are commonly created by copying and modifying existing ones. Typically denoted clone-and-own, software quality and overall maintainability are adversely affected in the long-run. With safety being pivotal, a fault in one variant may require the entire portfolio to be assessed. Thus, engineers need to maintain legacy systems dating back decades, implemented in programming languages such as Pascal. Software product lines (SPLs) can be a remedy but migrating legacy systems requires their prior analysis and comparison. For industrial software systems, this remains a challenge.In this paper, we introduce a comparison procedure and customizable metrics to allow for a fine-grained comparison of Pascal modules to the level of individual expressions. By that, we identify common parts of while also capturing different parts between modules as a basis for a transition towards anSPLs practice. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using a case study with seven Pascal modules totaling 13,271 lines of code with an evolution-history of 25 years and show our procedure to be fast and precise. Furthermore, we elaborate on the case study and detail peculiarities of the Pascal modules, which are characteristic for an evolution-history of a quarter century.},

abstract = {Software complexity may be reduced and productivity may be increased by the synergy of Component-Based Software Engineering and Software Product Line Engineering. The synergistic techniques decrease complexity by uplifting software artifacts to a higher abstraction level, namely the component level, and defining the interfaces, interactions, and contexts of such artifacts for composing software systems. Such synergistic techniques also facilitate productivity increase by promoting feature reusability, leveraging component replacement and offering selectivity among product variants. When applied to Distributed Real-time and Embedded (DRE) systems, however, these technologies must fulfill such systems' time-critical missions and numerous functional and Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. New critical challenges to be solved are QoS sensitivity that influences functional validity and performance quality, tangled requirements that increase the complexity of requirements evaluation and abundant unsatisfactory design artifacts that introduce unnecessary development workload. With an aim to answer the QoS sensitivity problem and alleviate the requirements evaluation complexity and development workload in the analysis and design workflows of a DRE software product line construction, this dissertation introduces a Quality of Service-driven software Product Line engineering framework (QoSPL). Such a framework consists of domain engineering, application engineering and quantitative analysis processes. The domain engineering process analyzes QoS requirements, represented as the execution flows of application-specific and functionality-determined tasks, and their common and variable features by means of a grammar-oriented specification language. The application engineering process models a set of execution flows to describe the behavioral characteristics of a DRE system by means of formalism with concurrent and asynchronous behaviors in a timely manner. A DRE software product line can be realized by varying different components and/or execution flows. The quantitative analysis process utilizes evolutionary algorithms to simulate the influence factors of the deployment environment and to search the optimal simulation results. Less probable design artifacts in terms of their QoS requirements can be eliminated by means of programs written in a domain-specific language. Adaptive approaches written in the domain-specific language hasten the convergence rates and/or obtain better optimal results for the quantitative analysis process. This dissertation provides two case studies and a number of experimental results to show the benefits of using QoSPL for a DRE software product line construction.},

abstract = {Featured modal contract automata (FMCA) have been proposed as a suitable formalism for modelling contract-based dynamic service product lines. A contract is a behavioural description consisting of offers and necessary and permitted service requests with different levels of criticality, to be matched with corresponding offers of other FMCA. Each contract is equipped with a feature constraint, whose features are offers or requests, and characterises a valid product orchestration. A safe orchestration of a product fulfils all necessary and the maximum number of permitted requests, such that all enabled features are available and none of its disabled features is. The entire product line orchestration can be computed from a subset of valid product orchestrations, by exploiting their (partial) ordering. The open-source prototypical toolkit FMCAT supports the specification and orchestration of FMCA, and it interfaces with FeatureIDE for importing feature models and their valid products. In this experience report, we show how to model a Hotel service product line with FMCA and how to analyse it with FMCAT.},

abstract = {Diversification of software assets through changing requirements impose a constant challenge on the developers and maintainers of large software systems. Recent research has addressed the mining for data in software repositories of single products ranging from fine- to coarse grained analyses. But so far, little attention has been payed to mining data about the evolution of product families. In this work, we study the evolution and commonalities of three variants of the BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution), a large open source operating system. The research questions we tackle are concerned with how to generate high level views of the system discovering and indicating evolutionary highlights. To process the large amount of data, we extended our previously developed approach for storing release history information to support the analysis of product families. In a case study we apply our approach on data from three different code repositories representing about 8.5GB of data and 10 years of active development.},

The 2019 SPLC Sampling Challenge provides large real-world feature models and asks for a t-wise sampling algorithm that can work for those models.We evaluated t-wise coverage by uniform sampling (US) the configurations of one of the provided feature models. US means that every (legal) configuration is equally likely to be selected. US yields statistically representative samples of a configuration space and can be used as a baseline to compare other sampling algorithms.We used existing algorithm called Smarch to uniformly sample SPL configurations. While uniform sampling alone was not enough to produce 100% 1-wise and 2-wise coverage, we used standard probabilistic analysis to explain our experimental results and to conjecture how uniform sampling may enhance the scalability of existing t-wise sampling algorithms.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) product lines appear in a wide range of applications of different domains (e.g., car's doors' windows, doors of a lift, etc.). The variability of these systems is large and as a result they can be configured into plenty of configurations. Testing each of the configurations can be time consuming as not only software has to be simulated, but also the hardware and the physical layer of the CPS, which is often modelled with complex mathematical models. Choosing the adequate test control strategy is critical when testing CPSs product lines. This paper presents a set of test control algorithms organized in an architecture of three layers (domain, application and simulation) for testing CPSs product lines. An illustrative example of a CPS product line is presented and three experiments are conducted to measure the performance of the proposed test control algorithms. We conclude that test scheduling and test suite minimization significantly help to reduce the overall test costs while preserving the test quality in CPSs product lines. In addition, we conclude that knowing the results of the previously tested configurations permits reducing the time for the detection of anomalous designs.},

We infer such a correlation using four regression methods based on small samples of measured configurations, without additional effort to detect feature interactions. We conduct experiments on six real-world case studies to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the regression methods. A key finding in our empirical study is that one regression method, called Bagging, is identified as the best to make accurate and robust predictions for the studied systems.},

abstract = {In product line engineering (PLE) a major challenge is the complexity of artifacts that have to be handled. In real-world product lines, variability models can become large and complex comprising thousands of elements with hundreds of non-trivial dependencies. Visual and interactive techniques aim to reduce the (cognitive) complexity and support the user during challenging PLE tasks like product configuration. There are many visualization techniques described in the literature -- e.g., in Software Visualization -- and some isolated techniques have been applied in PLE tools. Nevertheless, the full potential of visualization in the context of PLE has not been exploited so far. This paper provides an overview of (1) available visualization techniques and criteria to judge their benefits and drawbacks for product configuration, (2) which have been applied in product configuration in PLE, and (3) which could be beneficial to support product configuration. We propose a research agenda for future work in visual and interactive PLE techniques.},

abstract = {With the increasingly pervasive role of software in society, security is becoming an important quality concern, emphasizing security by design, but it requires intensive specialization.Security in families of systems is even harder, as diverse variants of security solutions must be considered, with even different security goals per product. Furthermore, security is not a static object but a moving target, adding variability.For this, an approach to systematically address security concerns in software product lines is needed. It should consider security separate from other variability dimensions. The main challenges to realize this are: (i) expressing security and its variability, (ii) selecting the right solution, (iii) properly instantiating a solution, and (iv) verifying and validating it.In this paper, we present our research agenda towards addressing the aforementioned challenges.},

abstract = {Dynamic software product lines demand self-adaptation of their behavior to deal with runtime contextual changes in their environment and offer a personalized product to the user. However, taking user preferences and context into account impedes the manual configuration process, and thus, an efficient and automated procedure is required. To automate the configuration process, context-aware recommendation techniques have been acknowledged as an effective mean to provide suggestions to a user based on their recognized context. In this work, we propose a collaborative filtering method based on tensor factorization that allows an integration of contextual data by modeling an N-dimensional tensor User-Feature-Context instead of the traditional two-dimensional User-Feature matrix. In the proposed approach, different types of non-functional properties are considered as additional contextual dimensions. Moreover, we show how to self-configure software product lines by applying our N-dimensional tensor factorization recommendation approach. We evaluate our approach by means of an empirical study using two datasets of configurations derived for medium-sized product lines. Our results reveal significant improvements in the predictive accuracy of the configuration over a state-of-the-art non-contextual matrix factorization approach. Moreover, it can scale up to a 7-dimensional tensor containing hundred of configurations in a couple of milliseconds.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines are typically used to support development of a software product family and not a software product population, which denotes a broader and more diverse range of software products. We present a Software Product Line Infrastructure (SPLI) that has been designed to increase the reuse of software efforts in product populations. The SPLI takes a bottom-up approach by structuring product features in highly reusable software components called Active Components which contain different types of artefacts. Variability is expressed using domain-specific models and formal variability models. Variability is bound during product derivation by executing model-to-artefact transformations. Components are active because they are invoked during the derivation process, thereby empowering the component. The SPLI enables step-wise refinements of applications by allowing specialization and composition of models before variability is bound. A prototype of the SPLI has been created that was used to develop and evaluate an experimental software product line. It is concluded that within the context of our experimental software product line the SPLI improves software reuse in software product populations.},

abstract = {Software companies encounter variability in space as variants of software systems need to be produced for different customers. At the same time, companies need to handle evolution in time because the customized variants need to be revised and kept up-to-date. This leads to a predicament in practice with many system variants significantly diverging from each other. Maintaining these variants consistently is difficult, as they diverge across space, i.e., different feature combinations, and over time, i.e., revisions of features. This work presents an automated feature revision location technique that traces feature revisions to their implementation. To assess the correctness of our technique, we used variants and revisions from three open source highly configurable software systems. In particular, we compared the original artifacts of the variants with the composed artifacts that were located by our technique. The results show that our technique can properly trace feature revisions to their implementation, reaching traces with 100% precision and 98% recall on average for the three analyzed subject systems, taking on average around 50 seconds for locating feature revisions per variant used as input.},

A visual representation of these products is an important factor in terms of user experience. However, an analysis of 100+ existing configurators highlights that not all provide visual representations of configured products. One of the current challenges is the trade-off developers face between either the memory consuming use of pregenerated images of all the combinations of options, or rendering products on the fly, which is non trivial to implement efficiently. We believe that a new approach to associate product configurations to visual representations is needed to compose and render them dynamically.

abstract = {In a software product line (SPL) engineering approach, the addressed variability in core-code assets must be consistent with the specified domain variability, usually captured in a variability model, e.g., a feature model. Currently, the support for checking such consistency is limited, mostly when a single variability implementation technique is used, e.g., preprocessors in C. In realistic SPLs, variability is implemented using a combined set of traditional techniques, e.g., inheritance, overloading, design patterns. An inappropriate choice and combination of such techniques become the source of variability inconsistencies. In this paper, we present a tooled approach to check the consistency of variability between the specification and implementation levels, when several variability implementation techniques are used together. The proposed method models the implemented variability in terms of variation points and variants, in a forest-like structure, and uses slicing to partially check the resulting propositional formulas at both levels. As a result, it offers an early and automatic detection of inconsistencies when the mapping of variability between both levels is ideal, and with a possible extension to 1 -- to -- m mapping. We implemented and successfully applied the approach in four case studies. Our implementation, publicly available, detects inconsistencies in a very short time, which makes possible to ensure consistency earlier in the development process.},

abstract = {The large number of possible configurations makes it unfeasible to test every single system variant in a product line. Consequently, a small subset of the product line products must be selected, typically following combinatorial interaction testing approaches. Recently, many product line engineering approaches have considered the selection and prioritization of relevant products within the product line. In a further step, these products are thoroughly tested individually. However, the test cases that must be executed in each of the products are not always insignificant, and in systems such as Cyber-Physical System Product Lines (CPSPLs), their test execution time can vary from tens to thousands of seconds. This issue leads to spending a lot of time testing each individual product. To solve this problem we propose a search-based approach to perform the testing of product lines by allocating small number of test cases in each of the products. This approach increases the probability of detecting faults faster. Specifically, our search-based approach obtains a set of products, which are derived from using any state-of-the-art approach as inputs, and a set of attributed test cases. As an output a list of allocated test cases for each product is obtained. We also define a novel fitness function to guide the search and we propose corresponding crossover and mutation operators. The search and test process is iteratively repeated until the time budget is consumed. We performed an evaluation with a CPSPL as a case study. Results suggest that our approach can reduce the fault detection time by 61% and 65% on average when compared with the traditional test process and the Random Search algorithm respectively.},

abstract = {Product Derivation is a key activity in Software Product Line Engineering. During this process, derivation operators modify or create core assets (e.g., model elements, source code instructions, components) by adding, removing or substituting them according to a given configuration. The result is a derived product that generally needs to conform to a programming or modeling language. Some operators lead to invalid products when applied to certain assets, some others do not; knowing this in advance can help to better use them, however this is challenging, specially if we consider assets expressed in extensive and complex languages such as Java. In this paper, we empirically answer the following question: which product line operators, applied to which program elements, can synthesize variants of programs that are incorrect, correct or perhaps even conforming to test suites? We implement source code transformations, based on the derivation operators of the Common Variability Language. We automatically synthesize more than 370,000 program variants from a set of 8 real large Java projects (up to 85,000 lines of code), obtaining an extensive panorama of the sanity of the operations.},

abstract = {Many approaches to software product line engineering have been founded on the development of a single product line platform. However as customer requirements change and new products are added to the product line, software producers recognize that the platform cannot be "stretched" indefinitely and a significant problem is striking a balance between development efficiency by increasing platform commonality and customer dissatisfaction from products with additional undesirable features and properties.One alternative is to develop multiple product lines (MPLs). However the challenge remains about what to include in a multiple product line platform. Drawing upon industrial experience of working with 4 companies, this paper explores the characteristics of the contexts in which MPLs are a viable alternative development strategy and then proposes a framework of approaches to platform development.},

Two important pillars of this initiative are "smart products" and "smart factories". From the perspective of product line engineering, these can be seen as two product lines (product line of factories and product line of goods) that need to be integrated for a common systems engineering approach. In this paper, we look at this problem from the perspective of configuration technologies, outline the research challenges in this area and illustrate our vision using an industrial example. The factory product line goes hand-in-hand with the product line of the products to be manufactured. Future research in product line engineering needs to consider an ecosystem of a multitude of stakeholders - e.g., factory component vendors, product designers, factory owners/operators and end-consumers.},

abstract = {The idea to treat domain-specific languages (DSL) as software product lines (SPL) of compilers/interpreters led to the introduction of language product lines (LPL). Although there exist various methodologies and tools for designing LPLs, they fail to provide basic IDE services for language variants-such as, syntax highlighting, auto completion, and debugging support-that programmers normally expect. While state-of-the-art language development tools permit the generation of basic IDE services for a specific language variant, most tools fail to consider and support reuse of basic IDE services of families of DSLs. Consequently, to provide basic IDE services for an LPL, one either generates them for the many language variants or designs a separate SPL of IDEs scattering language concerns. In contrast, we aim to piggyback basic IDE services on language features and provide an IDE for LPLs, which fosters their reuse when generating language variants. In detail, we extended the Neverlang language workbench to permit piggybacking syntax highlighting and debugging support on language components. Moreover, we developed an LPL-driven Eclipse-based plugin that includes a syntax highlighting editor and debugger for an LPL with piggybacked basic IDE services, i.e., where modular language features include the definition for syntax highlighting and debugging. Within this work, we introduce a general mechanism for fostering the basic IDE services' reuse and demonstrate its feasibility by realizing context-aware syntax highlighting for a Java-based family of role-oriented programming languages and providing debugging support for the family of JavaScript-based languages.},

The rationale of AR is to foster the transition of knowledge from a mature research field to practical problems encountered in the daily routine.

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) have a long tradition and aim at reducing development costs by increasing reuse. They have been successfully applied to develop families of languages, ultimately establishing the field of Language Product Lines (LPLs). Currently, LPLs facilitate a family of textual languages by defining an SPL of compilers/interpreters. In contrast, this work aims at supporting families of graphical languages by defining an SPL of graphical editors, whereas each language variant is supported by a corresponding product of a Graphical Editor Product Line (GEPL). Thus far, there exists no modular approach for the development of GEPLs for families of visual languages. To remedy this, this paper introduces a feature-oriented development approach for GEPLs that ensures modularity, maintainability, and extensibility of the resulting product line. To showcase the suitability and applicability of our approach, we developed a modular GEPL for the family of role-based modeling languages, a feature rich family of conceptual modeling languages. Finally, we illustrate its extensibility by adding a complex language feature.},

Several aspects influence the selection of features for a concrete product, such as dependencies and constraints between features, the different stakeholders involved in the process, the desired degree of quality, and cost constraints. This paper presents the vision of a configurator that will focus on providing indicators of security and performance for features and empowering its users to interactively observe the effect of the selected set of features on these two quality characteristics. We propose the use of reusable expert knowledge and static analysis for obtaining the indicators of security and performance, respectively. The two main issues to be investigated are: (1) to which degree the configuration process should be automated; and (2) how exactly to obtain indicators of security and performance for features that can be used to predict the security and performance of whole configurations.},

abstract = {In systems engineering, practitioners shall explore numerous architectural alternatives until choosing the most adequate variant. The decision-making process is most of the time a manual, time-consuming, and error-prone activity. The exploration and justification of architectural solutions is ad-hoc and mainly consists in a series of tries and errors on the modeling assets. In this paper, we report on an industrial case study in which we apply variability modeling techniques to automate the assessment and comparison of several candidate architectures (variants). We first describe how we can use a model-based approach such as the Common Variability Language (CVL) to specify the architectural variability. We show that the selection of an architectural variant is a multi-criteria decision problem in which there are numerous interactions (veto, favor, complementary) between criteria.We present a tooled process for exploring architectural variants integrating both CVL and the MYRIAD method for assessing and comparing variants based on an explicit preference model coming from the elicitation of stakeholders' concerns. This solution allows understanding differences among variants and their satisfactions with respect to criteria. Beyond variant selection automation improvement, this experiment results highlight that the approach improves rationality in the assessment and provides decision arguments when selecting the preferred variants.},

Such systems are a challenge for software testing and maintenance, because bugs and other defects can and do appear in any configuration. One common requirement for many development tasks is to identify the configurations that lead to a given defect or some other program behavior. We distill this requirement down to a challenge question: given a program location in a source file, what are valid configurations that include the location? The key obstacle is scalability. When there are thousands of configuration options, enumerating all combinations is exponential and infeasible. We provide a set of target programs of increasing difficulty and variations on the challenge question so that submitters of all experience levels can try out solutions. Our hope is to engage the community and stimulate new and interesting approaches to the problem of analyzing configurations.},

abstract = {The automated analysis of feature models is used to extract useful information from the description of variant and common parts in software product lines. The complexity and large-scale of real feature models makes the manual analysis a tedious or even in-feasible task. For example, feature models from different domains such as operating systems or mobile ecosystems are available with thousands of features and complex relationships among them. The analysis of this kind of models requires efficient techniques and some have been explored in the past. In this thesis we propose to explore different efficient analysis alternatives. This research work will first explore parallel solutions for the Automated Analysis of Feature Models (AAFM). We review current solutions for the AAFM and, based on their efficiency and quality results, choose a few algorithmic solutions to analyze their availability of being parallelizable and propose their parallel version, to finally evaluate their results quality, performance and improvements respecting their sequential versions. We plan to explore later other efficient alternatives and summarize the advances to provide efficient ready-to-use tools for analysis purposes.},

abstract = {Software product families provide an efficient means of reuse between a set of related products. However, software product families are often solely associated with intra-organisational reuse. This paper presents a case study of Fathammer, a small company developing games for different mobile devices. Reuse at Fathammer takes place at multiple levels. The game framework and engine of Fathammer is reused by partner companies that in turn produce game assets to be reused by Fathammer while developing games for various devices. Very rapid development of games is a necessity for Fathammer, whereas maintainability of games is not important. The above characteristics in particular distinguish Fathammer from other case studies and practices usually presented in the product family literature. The results show the applicability and challenges of software product family practices in the context of multiple collaborating companies and a fast-changing domain.},

abstract = {Software maintenance and evolution activities are responsible for the emergence of a great demand of feature location approaches that search relevant code in a large codebase. However, this search is usually performed manually and relies heavily on developers. In this paper, we propose a feature location approach that, instead of searching directly into code from a natural language query as other approaches do, transforms a natural language query to a query that is made up of the requirements that are located as relevant. Furthermore, our approach limits the scope of the code search space by selecting only the code of those products that hold relevant requirements. We evaluate the overall effectiveness of our approach in the industrial domain of train control software. Our results show that our approach improves in 18.1% the results of precision with regard to searching directly into code, which encourages further research in this direction.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering has spread as a technique for promoting the efficient development of embedded products with many product line-ups. During the development of network switch products at Hitachi Metals, Ltd., the number of development man-months increased as the number of product line-ups increased. Therefore, we shifted our development paradigm to product line development for efficient product development. We classified software assets as implementation assets, test assets, and design assets, and from these three assets, we extracted common objects and integrated them as reusable elements. By doing so, we promoted the efficient development of software assets and reduced the contradictions between the contents of the software assets. As a result, we reduced the amount of the source code by 53.1%. In this paper, we discuss the details of our technique and the effect of applying it. In addition, we discuss how you can apply our technique in the development of other products.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is often constructed as a set of features, such that individual products can be assembled from a set of common features and a selection of optional features. Although features are conceptualized, developed, and evolved as separate concerns, it is often the case that, in practice, they interfere with each other -- called a feature interaction. In this paper, we precisely define what it means for one feature to have a behaviour interaction with another feature, where the behaviour of one feature is affected by the presence of another feature. Specifically, we use a form of bisimilarity to define when the behaviour of a feature in isolation differs from its behaviour in the presence of an interacting feature. We also consider the case where features are modelled in a language that allows the specification of intended interactions, and we adapt our use of bisimilarity to provide a formal definition for unintended behaviour interactions.},

abstract = {Substantial effort has been spent on extending specification notations and their associated reasoning techniques to software product lines (SPLs). Family-based analysis techniques operate on a single artifact, referred to as a family model, that is annotated with variability constraints. This modeling approach paves the way for efficient model-based testing and model checking for SPLs. Albeit reasonably efficient, the creation and maintenance of family models tend to be time consuming and error-prone, especially if there are crosscutting features. To tackle this issue, we introduce FFSMDiff, a fully automated technique to learn featured finite state machines (FFSM), a family-based formalism that unifies Mealy Machines from SPLs into a single representation. Our technique incorporates variability to compare and merge Mealy machines and annotate states and transitions with feature constraints. We evaluate our technique using 34 products derived from three different SPLs. Our results support the hypothesis that families of Mealy machines can be effectively merged into succinct FFSMs with fewer states, especially if there is high feature sharing among products. These indicate that FFSMDiff is an efficient family-based model learning technique.},

This software architecture can be created beforehand, but must also be updated to reflect changes in the domain, and hence the requirements of the software. The choice of which software architecture to use is typically based on informal decisions. There exist, to the best of our knowledge, little factual knowledge of which quality attributes are supported or obstructed by different architecture approaches. In this paper we present an empirical study of a method that enables quantification of the perceived support different software architectures give for different quality attributes.

abstract = {Technical architectures (TAs) represent the computing infrastructure of a company with all its hardware and software components. Over the course of time, the number of TAs grows with the companies' requirements and usually a large variety of TAs has to be maintained. Core challenge is the missing information on relations between the existing variants of TAs, which complicates reuse of solutions across systems. However, identifying these relations is an expensive task as architects have to manually analyze each TA individually. Restructuring the existing TAs poses severe risks as often sufficient information is not available (e.g., due to time constraints). To avoid failures in productive systems and resulting loss of profit, companies continue to create new solutions without restructuring existing ones. This increased variability in TAs represents technical debt. In this paper, we adapt the idea of variability mining from the software product line domain and present an efficient and automatic mining algorithm to identify the common and varying parts of TAs by analyzing a potentially arbitrary number of TAs in parallel. Using the identified variability information, architects are capable of analyzing the relations of TAs, identifying reuse potential, and making well-founded maintenance decisions. We show the feasibility and scalability of our approach by applying it to a real-world industrial case study with large sets of TAs.},

abstract = {SPL product customers might not always wait for the next core asset release. When an organization aims to react to market events, quick bug fixes or urgent customer requests, strategies are needed to support fast adaptation, e.g. with product-specific extensions, which are later propagated into the SPL. This leads to the grow-and-prune model where quick reaction to changes often requires copying and specialization (grow) to be later cleaned up by merging and refactoring (prune). This paper focuses on the grow stage. Here, application engineers branch off the core-asset Master branch to account for their products' specifics within the times and priorities of their customers without having to wait for the next release of the core assets. However, this practice might end up in the so-called "integration hell". When long-living branches are merged back into the Master, the amount of code to be integrated might cause build failures or requires complex troubleshooting. On these premises, we advocate for making application engineers aware of potential coordination problems right during coding rather than deferring it until merge time. To this end, we introduce the notion of "peering bar" for Version Control Systems, i.e. visual bars that reflect whether your product's features are being upgraded in other product branches. In this way, engineers are aware of what their peers are doing on the other SPL's products. Being products from the same SPL, they are based on the very same core assets, and hence, bug ixes or functional enhancements undertaken for a product might well serve other products. This work introduces design principles for peering bars. These principles are fleshed out for GitHub as the Version Control System, and pure::variants as the SPL framework.},

In order to support such dynamic changes, we propose to adopt Software Product Line techniques. In particular, we adopt a feature model and product line architecture to capture the variability among software fault tolerance strategies based on design diversity. We propose an infrastructure that supports the strategy changes at runtime through dynamic management of variability and is responsible for the dependable mediation logic between service clients and redundant services. The infrastructure has an autonomous controller (i.e. managing a loop of collection, analysis, planning and execution), which is responsible for monitoring the changes of (i) QoS level and (ii) user requirements and decides, in accordance with high-level policies, an appropriate fault tolerance strategy to be executed. Also, our solution allows the dynamic provision of redundant services by describing them in terms of semantics. Finally, we performed a proof of concept which indicates the feasibility of the proposed solution.},

abstract = {Today's adaptive software systems (i) are often highly configurable product lines, exhibiting hundreds of potentially conflicting configuration options; (ii) are context dependent, forcing the system to reconfigure to ever-changing contextual situations at runtime; (iii) need to fulfill context-dependent performance goals by optimizing measurable nonfunctional properties. Usually, a large number of consistent configurations exists for a given context, and each consistent configuration may perform differently with regard to the current context and performance goal(s). Therefore, it is crucial to consider nonfunctional properties for identifying an appropriate configuration. Existing black-box approaches for estimating the performance of configurations provide no means for determining context-sensitive reconfiguration decisions at runtime that are both consistent and optimal, and hardly allow for combining multiple context-dependent quality goals. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive approach based on Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) for obtaining consistent and optimal reconfiguration decisions. We use training data obtained from simulations to learn performance-influence models. A novel integrated runtime representation captures both consistency properties and the learned performance-influence models. Our solution provides the flexibility to define multiple context-dependent performance goals. We have implemented our approach as a standalone component. Based on an Internet-of-Things case study using adaptive wireless sensor networks, we evaluate our approach with regard to effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability.},

abstract = {Tolerating inconsistencies is well accepted in design modeling because it is often neither obvious how to fix an inconsistency nor important to do so right away. However, there are technical reasons why inconsistencies are not tolerated in many areas of software engineering. The most obvious being that common reasoning engines are rendered (partially) useless in the presence of inconsistencies. This paper investigates automated strategies for tolerating inconsistencies during decision-making in product line engineering, based on isolating parts from reasoning that cause inconsistencies. We compare trade offs concerning incorrect and incomplete reasoning and demonstrate that it is even possible to fully eliminate incorrect reasoning in the presence of inconsistencies at the expense of marginally less complete reasoning. Our evaluation is based on seven medium-to-large size software product line case studies. It is important to note that our mechanism for tolerating inconsistencies can be applied to arbitrary SAT problems and thus the basic principles of this approach are applicable to other domains also.},

Variation in space refers to differences among variants that are designed to coexist in parallel. There are numerous analyses to cope with variation in space (i.e., product-line analyses) and others that cope with variation in time (i.e., regression analyses). The goal of this work is to discuss to which extent product-line analyses can be applied to revisions and, conversely, where regression analyses can be applied to variants. In addition, we discuss challenges related to the combination of product-line and regression analyses.

Most approaches about performance measurement have been defined over traditional highly repetitive and well-structured processes. However, current organizational and business needs have encouraged the appearance of customizable processes to manage collections of process variants derived from a process, and loosely specified processes to manage non-repeatable and unpredictable processes. However, current techniques of performance measurement have not evolved to the same pace that business processes, thus generating a gap between processes and the measurement of their performance. The thesis introduced in this paper, is focused on enhancing the performance measurement of business processes by means of the improvement of existing techniques for the definition of process performance indicators and their applicability to different types of processes. With this purpose a set of artifacts, including a metamodel, notations, tools and methodologies will be developed. They will be validated by means of case studies based on real scenarios.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering (SPLE) and variability enforcement techniques have been applied to run-time adaptive systems for quite some years, also in the context of multi-tenant Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. The focus has been mainly on (1) the pre-deployment phases of the development life cycle and (2) fine-grained (tenant-level), run-time activation of specific variants. However, with upcoming trends such as DevOps and continuous delivery and deployment, operational aspects become increasingly important.In this paper, we present our integrated vision on the positive interplay between SPLE and adaptive middleware for multi-tenant SaaS applications, focusing on the operational aspects of running and maintaining a successful SaaS offering. This vision, called Service Lines, is based on and motivated by our experience and frequent interactions with a number of Belgian SaaS providers.We concretely highlight and motivate a number of operational use cases that require advanced variability support in middleware and have promising added value for the economic feasibility of SaaS offerings. In addition, we provide a gap analysis of what is currently lacking from the perspectives of variability modeling and management techniques and middleware support, and as such sketch a concrete roadmap for continued research in this area.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPL) have largely been taken on board by industry. Several reports from large companies such as Bosch, Nokia, Philips and Siemens witness gains and benefits achieved with their use, especially with respect to the reduction on time to market. In SPL development, domain analysis plays a central role where the relevant features are identified. Feature-Oriented Domain Analysis is a method which uses a feature model to specify variabilities and commonalities of an SPL. However, activities related to the Domain Analysis process (managing commonalities and variabilities, with users visibility and relevant stakeholders) in most cases, do not seem to be a simple and easy activity, since to represent these analyzes in modelling domain tools with a certain degree of formality, requires a technical knowledge that domain experts do not always have it prior to use. But creative requirements techniques have been suggested to facilitate the elicitation activity by filling the gap the communications problems between domain experts and software engineers, making the domain analysis more agile. Thus, to improve the domain analysis process, this paper seeks to set out the use of a creative and agile technique for modelling requirements by means of mind maps for cognitive and effective support when building feature models.},

abstract = {Identifying features and their relations (i.e., variation points) is crucial in the process of migrating single software systems to software product lines (SPL). Various approaches have been proposed to perform feature extraction automatically from different artifacts, for instance, feature location in legacy code. Usually such approaches a) omit variability information and b) rely on artifacts that reside in advanced phases of the development process, thus, being only of limited usefulness in the context of SPLs. In contrast, feature and variability extraction from natural language (NL) documents is more favorable, because a mapping to several other artifacts is usually established from the very beginning. In this paper, we provide a multi-dimensional overview of approaches for feature and variability extraction from NL documents by means of a systematic literature review (SLR). We selected 25 primary studies and carefully evaluated them regarding different aspects such as techniques used, tool support, or accuracy of the results. In a nutshell, our key insights are that i) standard NLP techniques are commonly used, ii) post-processing often includes clustering &amp; machine learning algorithms, iii) only in rare cases, the approaches support variability extraction, iv) tool support, apart from text pre-processing is often not available, and v) many approaches lack a comprehensive evaluation. Based on these observations, we derive future challenges, arguing that more effort need to be invested for making such approaches applicable in practice.},

abstract = {The large variety of computerized solutions (software and information systems) calls for a systematic approach to their comparison and evaluation. Different methods have been proposed over the years for analyzing the similarity and variability of systems. These methods get artifacts, such as requirements, design models, or code, of different systems (commonly in the same domain), identify and calculate their similarities, and represent the variability in models, such as feature diagrams. Most methods rely on implementation considerations of the input systems and generate outcomes based on predefined, fixed strategies of comparison (referred to as variability views). In this paper, we introduce an approach for mining relevant views for comparison and evaluation, based on the input artifacts. Particularly, we equip SOVA – a Semantic and Ontological Variability Analysis method – with data mining techniques in order to identify relevant views that highlight variability or similarity of the input artifacts (natural language requirement documents). The comparison is done using entropy and Rand index measures. The method and its outcomes are evaluated on a case of three photo sharing applications.},

In industrial scenarios, CAO consumes high amounts of time and effort without guaranteeing good results. We propose a novel approach, Computer Assisted CAO (CACAO), that given the natural language requirements of a new product, and the legacy products from that family, ranks the legacy methods in the family for each of the new product requirements according to their relevancy to the new development. We evaluated our approach in the industrial domain of train control software. Without CACAO, software engineers tasked with the development of a new product had to manually review a total of 2200 methods in the family. Results show that CACAO can reduce the number of methods to be reviewed, and guide software engineers towards the identification of relevant legacy methods to be reused in the new product.},

abstract = {The variability of the common features in an Software Product Line (SPL) can be managed by an feature model, an artifact that consist of a tree-shaped diagram, that describe the features identified in the products and the possible relationships between them. Guarantee the quality of the feature model may be essential to ensure that errors do not propagate across all products. The process of evaluating the quality of a product or artifact can be done using measures, which may reflect the characteristics, sub-characteristics or attributes of quality. However, the isolated values of each measure do not allow access to a whole quality of the feature model, since most of the measures cover several specific aspects that are not correlated. In this context, this paper proposes the aggregation of measures in order to evaluate the maintainability of the feature model in SPL. We aim to investigate how to aggregate these measures and access the respective sub-characteristics by means of a single aggregate value that has the same available information as a set of measures. For this, we have used the theory of Fuzzy Logic as a technique for aggregation of these measures. The new aggregate measure represents the maintainability index of a feature models (MIFM) was obtained. Moreover, to evaluate the MIFM, we applied it to a set of models. It was verified that the aggregate measure obtained allows to measure if a feature models has a high or low maintainability index, supporting the domain engineer in the evaluation of the maintenance of the feature model in a faster and more precise way.},

However, not all requirements on designing such architectures have been addressed in depth within current research. This paper presents QUASAR, a process framework that supports the design of high-quality product family architectures. QUASAR deals with early architectural considerations, guides the modelling of architectural views and variability, and documents how to evaluate the achievement of architectural qualities.

Despite the many benefits that come with using the product-line approach, many companies are hesitant to migrate to an integrated platform for their product variants because such a migration is considered challenging and risky. Often this perception is because the migration is seen as a drastic change that is not easy to verify and assure developers that the migrated products still operate as before. In this research we propose to develop a language structure (or abstract representation) of artifacts in a software asset base that would facilitate an incremental migration of several code bases to an integrated platform. We further seek to propose and evaluate techniques for verifying the migrated product line with respect to its original code bases.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) is one of the most recent and effective reuse approaches. SPL derives several products from the core artefacts. SPL engineering includes two processes: domain engineering, which identifies the common and variable features to develop the core artefacts, and application engineering, which reuses the core artefacts to derive products. Once the artefacts are reused across multiple products, quality assessment is necessary to prevent inconsistencies from spreading across all SPL products. There are several frameworks and standards, as ISO/IEC 25010:2011, to evaluate quality characteristics. In this study, the authors provide an overview of the SPL quality assessment. Therefore, they perform a systematic mapping to compile and synthesise data regarding the quality characteristics assessed in studies from 2000 to 2019. The results include the identification of 346&nbsp;metrics applied in 16 software properties to evaluate three quality characteristics of the ISO/IEC 25010:2011. Additionally, they find the domain engineering evaluation frequently occurs regarding the maintainability characteristic. Moreover, they provide analyses of the: (i) metrics used by programming paradigm, (ii) metrics used by software properties, (iii) software properties evaluated for each quality characteristic, (iv) tools used to extract metrics, (v) systems used as benchmarks, and (vi) datasets used for extracting metrics.},

abstract = {Variability intensive systems may include several thousand features allowing for an enormous number of possible configurations, including wrong ones (e.g. the derived product does not compile). For years, engineers have been using constraints to a priori restrict the space of possible configurations, i.e. to exclude configurations that would violate these constraints. The challenge is to find the set of constraints that would be both precise (allow all correct configurations) and complete (never allow a wrong configuration with respect to some oracle). In this paper, we propose the use of a machine learning approach to infer such product-line constraints from an oracle that is able to assess whether a given product is correct. We propose to randomly generate products from the product line, keeping for each of them its resolution model. Then we classify these products according to the oracle, and use their resolution models to infer cross-tree constraints over the product-line. We validate our approach on a product-line video generator, using a simple computer vision algorithm as an oracle. We show that an interesting set of cross-tree constraint can be generated, with reasonable precision and recall.},

Activities concerning software process were hot in academia as well as in industry. The interest on software process saw its peak in early 1990's but lost the momentum soon. Then came the fever on software architecture.The book "Software Architecture" by M. Shaw and D. Garlan was published in 1996 and widely read. Design patterns and application frameworks drew attention about the same time, which together indicate a shift of interest from process to product.In 2000's, the interest on processes revived. One phenomenon is the upsurge of interest on the agile process. As software product lines (SPL) contains the word product in the term, it deals with a variety of products but its focus is also on the process of managing development and evolution of a family of similar software products.We will give a perspective on the alternating cycle of interest on product-centered view vs. process-centered view and then characterize SPL in this framework.},

We use our insights to make observations that are applicable to ecosystems in general, validate existing theories from the literature, and propose a predictive model for the evolution of software packages.

Our approach provides: (i) automated support to classify, for a new product in a product family, relevant and valid system test cases associated with previous products, and (ii) automated prioritization of system test cases using multiple risk factors such as fault-proneness of requirements and requirements volatility in a product family. Our evaluation was performed in the context of an industrial product family in the automotive domain. Results provide empirical evidence that we propose a practical and beneficial way to classify and prioritize system test cases for industrial product lines.},

abstract = {In Model Based Testing (MBT), test cases are generated automatically from a partial representation of expected behaviour of the System Under Test (SUT) (i.e., the model). For most industrial systems, it is impossible to generate all the possible test cases from the model. The test engineer recourse to generation algorithms that maximize a given coverage criterion, a metric indicating the percentage of possible behaviours of the SUT covered by the test cases. Our previous work redefined classical Transition Systems (TSs) criteria for SPLs, using Featured Transition Systems (FTSs), a mathematical structure to compactly represent the behaviour of a SPL, as model for test case generation. In this paper, we provide one all-states coverage driven generation algorithm and discuss its scalability and efficiency with respect to random generation. All-states and random generation are compared on fault-seeded FTSs.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of supporting effective code reuse as part of Software Product Line Engineering. Our approach is based on code forking -- a practice commonly used in industry where new products are created by cloning the existing ones. We propose to maintain meta-information allowing organization to reason about the developed product line in terms of features rather than incremental code changes made in different forks and to detect inconsistencies in implementations of these features. In addition, we propose to detect and maintain semantic, implementation-level require relationships between features, supporting the developers when they copy features from different branches or delete features in their own branch, thus facilitating reuse of features between products. Our approach aims at mitigating the disadvantages of the forking mechanism while leveraging its advantages. We illustrate the approach on an example, and discuss its possible implementation and integration with Software Configuration Management systems.},

abstract = {Proliferation of modeling languages has produced a great variety of similar languages whose individual maintenance is challenging and costly. Reusing the syntax and semantics of modeling languages and their heterogeneous constituents, however, is rarely systematic. Current research on modeling language reuse focuses on reusing abstract syntax in form of metamodel parts. Systematic reuse of static and dynamic semantics is yet to be achieved. We present an approach to compose syntax and semantics of independently developed modeling languages through language product lines and derive new stand-alone language products. Using the MontiCore language workbench, we implemented a mechanism to compose language syntaxes and the realization of their semantics in form of template-based code generators according to language product line configurations. Leveraging variability of product lines greatly facilitates reusing modeling language and alleviates their proliferation.},

abstract = {Model-based languages such as MATLAB/Simulink play an essential role in the model-driven development of software systems. To comply with new requirements, it is common practice to create new variants by copying existing systems and modifying them. Commonly referred to as clone-and-own, severe problems arise in the long-run when no dedicated variability management is installed. To allow for a documented and structured reuse of systems, their variability information needs to be reverse-engineered. In this paper, we propose an advanced comparison procedure, the Matching Window Technique, and a customizable metric. Both allow us to overcome structural alterations commonly performed during clone-and-own. We analyze related MATLAB/Simulink models and determine, classify and represent their variability information in an understandable way. With our technique, we assist model engineers in maintaining and evolving existing variants. We provide three feasibility studies with real-world models from the automotive domain and show our technique to be fast and precise. Furthermore, we perform semi-structured interviews with domain experts to assess the potential applicability of our technique in practice.},

abstract = {Identifying and extracting parts of a system's implementation for reuse is an important task for re-engineering system variants into Software Product Lines (SPLs). An SPL is an approach that enables systematic reuse of existing assets across related product variants. The re-engineering process to adopt an SPL from a set of individual variants starts with the location of features and their implementation, to be extracted and migrated into an SPL and reused in new variants. Therefore, feature location is of fundamental importance to the success in the adoption of SPLs. Despite its importance, existing feature location techniques struggle with huge, complex, and numerous system artifacts. This is the scenario of ArgoUML-SPL, which stands out as the most used case study for the validation of feature location approaches. In this paper we use an automated feature location technique and apply it to the ArgoUML feature location challenge posed.},

It consists of determining candidate services to a service-oriented environment based on pre-existing software artifacts, e.g., business process, source code, and so on. In order to provide a systematic identification of services, there are many available service identification methods in the literature, regarding different understanding of services, goals, and techniques. Due to this heterogeneity, this paper presents an in-depth comparison of service identification methods as well as a recommendation of the most suitable ones in the SOPLE context. This work can help the decision making of the most suitable method according to stakeholders' needs.},

They facilitate planning of improvement activities early in the lifecycle and allow limiting the changes on any existing software. This is particularly beneficial when the architecture has been planned to (or already does) support a whole product family, or a set of products that share common requirements, architecture, components or code. As the family requirements evolve and new products are added, the need to assess the evolvability of the existing architecture is vital. I illustrate two assessment case studies I have recently worked on in the mobile telephone software domain: the Symbian operating system platform and the network resource access control software system. The former assessment has been carried out as a task within the European project ESAPS, while the latter has been performed solely by Nokia. By means of simple experimental data, I show evidence of the usefulness of architectural assessment as rated by the participating stakeholders. Both assessments have led to the identification of previously unknown architectural defects, and to the consequent planning of improvement initiatives. In both cases, stakeholders noted that a number of side benefits, including improvement of communication and architectural documentation, were also of considerable importance. I illustrate the lessons we have learned, and outline suggestions for future research and experimentation.},

Ideally, testing a SPL involves testing all the software products that can be configured through the combination of features. This, however, is intractable in practice since a) large SPLs can lead to millions of possible software variants and b) the testing process is usually limited by budget and time constraints. To overcome this problem, this paper introduces PLEDGE, an open source tool that selects and prioritizes the product configurations maximizing the feature interactions covered. The uniqueness of PLEDGE is that it bypasses the computation of the feature interactions, allowing to scale to large SPLs.},

Some automated solvers can represent numerical features natively, but are limited in their ability to count and Uniform Random Sample (URS) configurations, which are key operations to derive unbiased statistics on configuration spaces.Bit-blasting is a technique to encode numerical constraints as propositional formulas. We use bit-blasting to encode Boolean and numerical constraints so that we can exploit existing #SAT solvers to count and URS configurations. Compared to state-of-art Satisfiability Modulo Theory and Constraint Programming solvers, our approach has two advantages: 1) faster and more scalable configuration counting and 2) reliable URS of SPL configurations. We also show that our work can be used to extend prior SAT-based SPL analyses to support numerical features and constraints.},

abstract = {A number of SAT-based analysis concepts and tools for software product lines exist, that extract code dependencies in propositional logic from the source code assets of the product line. On these extracted conditions, SAT-solvers are used to reason about the variability. However, in practice, a lot of software product lines use integer-based variability. The variability variables hold integer values, and integer operators are used in the conditions. Most existing analysis tools can not handle this kind of variability; they expect pure Boolean conditions.This paper introduces an approach to convert integer-based variability conditions to propositional logic. Running this approach as a preparation on an integer-based product line allows the existing SAT-based analyses to work without any modifications. The pure Boolean formulas, that our approach builds as a replacement for the integer-based conditions, are mostly equivalent to the original conditions with respect to satisfiability. Our approach was motivated by and implemented in the context of a real-world industrial case-study, where such a preparation was necessary to analyze the variability.Our contribution is an approach to convert conditions, that use integer variables, into propositional formulas, to enable easy usage of SAT-solvers on the result. It works well on restricted variables (i.e. variables with a small range of allowed values); unrestricted integer variables are handled less exact, but still retain useful variability information.},

Cardinality-based feature models are used when variability applies not only to the selection or exclusion of features but also to the number of times a feature can be included in a product. Feature cardinalities are usually considered to apply in either a local or global scope. However, we have identified that these interpretations are insufficient to capture the variability of cloud environments. In this paper, we redefine cardinality-based feature models to allow multiple relative cardinalities between features and we discuss the effects of relative cardinalities on feature modeling semantics, consistency and cross-tree constraints. To evaluate our approach we conducted an analysis of relative cardinalities in four cloud computing providers. In addition, we developed tools for reasoning on feature models with relative cardinalities and performed experiments to verify the performance and scalability of the approach. The results from our study indicate that extending feature models with relative cardinalities is feasible and improves variability modeling, particularly in the case of cloud environments.},

abstract = {A Software Product Line is a set of software systems of a domain, which share some common features but also have significant variability. A feature model is a variability modeling artifact which represents differences among software products with respect to variability relationships among their features. Having a feature model along with a reference model developed in the domain engineering lifecycle, a concrete product of the family is derived by selecting features in the feature model (referred to as the configuration process) and by instantiating the reference model. However, feature model configuration can be a cumbersome task because: 1) feature models may consist of a large number of features, which are hard to comprehend and maintain; and 2) many factors including technical limitations, implementation costs, stakeholders' requirements and expectations must be considered in the configuration process. Recognizing these issues, a significant amount of research efforts has been dedicated to different aspects of feature model configuration such as automating the configuration process. Several approaches have been proposed to alleviate the feature model configuration challenges through applying visualization and interaction techniques. However, there have been limited empirical insights available into the impact of visualization and interaction techniques on the feature model configuration process. In this paper, we present a set of visualization and interaction interventions for representing and configuring feature models, which are then empirically validated to measure the impact of the proposed interventions. An empirical study was conducted by following the principles of control experiments in software engineering and by applying the well-known software quality standard ISO 9126 to operationalize the variables investigated in the experiment. The results of the empirical study revealed that the employed visualization and interaction interventions significantly improved completion time of comprehension and changing of the feature model configuration. Additionally, according to results, the proposed interventions are easy-to-use and easy-to-learn for the participants.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are often tested at different test levels following "X-in-the-Loop" configurations: Model-, Software- and Hardware-in-the-loop (MiL, SiL and HiL). While MiL and SiL test levels aim at testing functional requirements at the system level, the HiL test level tests functional as well as non-functional requirements by performing a real-time simulation. As testing CPS product line configurations is costly due to the fact that there are many variants to test, test cases are long, the physical layer has to be simulated and co-simulation is often necessary. It is therefore extremely important to select the appropriate test cases that cover the objectives of each level in an allowable amount of time. We propose an efficient test case selection approach adapted to the "X-in-the-Loop" test levels. Search algorithms are employed to reduce the amount of time required to test configurations of CPS product lines while achieving the test objectives of each level. We empirically evaluate three commonly-used search algorithms, i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA), Alternating Variable Method (AVM) and Greedy (Random Search (RS) is used as a baseline) by employing two case studies with the aim of integrating the best algorithm into our approach. Results suggest that as compared with RS, our approach can reduce the costs of testing CPS product line configurations by approximately 80% while improving the overall test quality.},

abstract = {A new generation of software product line success stories is being driven by a new generation of methods, tools and techniques. While early software product line case studies at the genesis of the field revealed some of the best software engineering improvement metrics seen in four decades, the latest generation of software product line success stories exhibit even greater improvements, extending benefits beyond product creation into maintenance and evolution, lowering the overall complexity of product line development, increasing the scalability of product line portfolios, and enabling organizations to make the transition to software product line practice with orders of magnitude less time, cost and effort. This tutorial explores some of the important new methods such as software mass customization sans application engineering, minimally invasive transitions, bounded product line combinatorics, and product line lifecycle management.},

abstract = {Many systems in the industrial automation domain include information systems. They manage manufacturing processes and control numerous distributed hardware and software components. In current practice, the development and reuse of such systems is costly and time-consuming, due to the variability of systems' topology and processes. Up to now, product line approaches for systematic modeling and management of variability have not been well established for such complex domains.In this paper, we present a model-based approach to support the derivation of systems in the target domain. The proposed architecture of the derivation infrastructure enables feature-, topology- and process configuration to be integrated into the multi-staged derivation process. We have developed a prototype to prove feasibility and improvement of derivation efficiency. We report the evaluation results that we collected through semi-structured interviews from domain stakeholders. The results show high potential to improve derivation efficiency by adopting the approach in practice. Finally, we report the lessons learned that raise the opportunities and challenges for future research.},

abstract = {One key challenge for software product lines is efficiently managing variability throughout their lifecycle. In this paper, we address the problem of variability in software product lines testing. We (1) identify a set of issues that must be addressed to make software product line testing work in practice and (2) provide a framework that combines a set of techniques to solve these issues. The framework integrates feature modelling, combinatorial interaction testing and constraint programming techniques. First, we extract variability in a software product line as a feature model with specified feature interdependencies. We then employ an algorithm that generates a minimal set of valid test cases covering all 2-way feature interactions for a given time interval. Furthermore, we evaluate the framework on an industrial SPL and show that using the framework saves time and provides better test coverage. In particular, our experiments show that the framework improves industrial testing practice in terms of (i) 17% smaller set of test cases that are (a) valid and (b) guarantee all 2-way feature coverage (as opposite to 19.2% 2-way feature coverage in the hand made test set), and (ii) full flexibility and adjustment of test generation to available testing time.},

abstract = {Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Software Product Lines (SPL) have individually proven to be software engineering concepts that create added value to the development of software systems. Recently, the research community has recognized and investigated potentials for combining these two concepts. However, there have been no mapping study and literature surveys that systematically review the present research results in combining the two. This paper presents results of a preliminary work on a systematic mapping study of research papers that report on combining SOA and SPL. The main goal of a systematic mapping study is to provide a breath overview, classification of approaches and the quantity and type of research as well as available research results, which is complimentary step toward further systematic literature review. This paper, based on selected papers published from 2002 to mid-2010, reports on various aspects of the analyzed literature, including the motivations for combining the two concepts; contributions to specific stages of software engineering lifecycles; types of synergies and characteristics that are accomplished through combinations of the two concepts; and the methods used for and the rigor of the evaluations of the research conducted on the studied topic.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a set of software systems that share a common and variable set of features. Software metrics provide basic means to quantify several modularity aspects of SPLs. However, the effectiveness of the SPL measurement process is directly dependent on the definition of reliable thresholds. If thresholds are not properly defined, it is difficult to actually know whether a given metric value indicates a potential problem in the feature implementation. There are several methods to derive thresholds for software metrics. However, there is little understanding about their appropriateness for the SPL context. This paper aims at comparing three methods to derive thresholds based on a benchmark of 33 SPLs. We assess to what extent these methods derive appropriate values for four metrics used in product-line engineering. These thresholds were used for guiding the identification of a typical anomaly found in features' implementation, named God Class. We also discuss the lessons learned on using such methods to derive thresholds for SPLs.},

The specific challenge is the integration of office devices with the workflows and existing office infrastructures of customers. Hence, an approach to support customization of office devices has been developed by Ricoh and Fraunhofer IESE. The approach builds upon product line engineering and focuses on improving application engineering to support customization based on the workflows and office infrastructures of specific customers. The key ideas of the approach are flexibility concepts on architecture level that support recurring types of customizations and a requirements engineering process that is driven by the workflows of individual customers. In this paper, the approach developed in cooperation with Ricoh is presented. A case study illustrates the applicability of the concepts and the overall approach.},

abstract = {In many Software product lines (SPLs), if domain variability can be properly specified in terms of features in a feature model (FM), their implementation in core-code assets is hard to capture and maintain, as there are different techniques to implement the variability. Even with an organization in variation points and variants, most of these techniques do not shape the code in terms of features, and inconsistencies appear when the variability evolves at one level with no co-evolution at the other. To help SPL architects, one possible solution is to be able to reconstruct the FM by capturing the variability in core-code assets, but different implementation techniques expose diverse characteristics, hampering the process. We study in this paper the diverse dimensions of the existing variability implementation techniques, and how they can be captured in an abstract way. We then categorize them regarding these dimensions in a single catalog, extending previous classifications of such techniques. We also briefly show how the characteristics of the techniques could help to better capture the implemented variability, opening some potential in reverse engineering processes.},

The resulting probabilistic configurations and behaviour converge seamlessly in a semantics based on DTMCs, thus enabling quantitative analyses ranging from the likelihood of certain behaviour to the expected average cost of products. This is supported by a Maude implementation of QFLan, integrated with the SMT solver Z3 and the distributed statistical model checker MultiVeStA. Our approach is illustrated with a bikes product line case study.},

abstract = {The optimization of software to be (more) energy efficient is becoming a major concern for the software industry. Although several techniques have been presented to measure energy consumption for software, none has addressed software product lines (SPLs). Thus, to measure energy consumption of a SPL, the products must be generated and measured individually, which is too costly.In this paper, we present a technique and a prototype tool to statically estimate the worst case energy consumption for SPL. The goal is to provide developers with techniques and tools to reason about the energy consumption of all products in a SPL, without having to produce, run and measure the energy in all of them.Our technique combines static program analysis techniques and worst case execution time prediction with energy consumption analysis. This technique analyzes all products in a feature-sensitive manner, that is, a feature used in several products is analyzed only once, while the energy consumption is estimated once per product.We implemented our technique in a tool called Serapis. We did a preliminary evaluation using a product line for image processing implemented in C. Our experiments considered 7 products from such line and our initial results show that the tool was able to estimate the worst-case energy consumption with a mean error percentage of 9.4% and standard deviation of 6.2% when compared with the energy measured when running the products.},

abstract = {Safety critical systems (e.g., an avionics control system for safe flight) are often required to achieve certification under pre-established standards (e.g., DO-178B for software considerations in airborne systems and equipment certification). We have been working with our industrial partner for the last three years to develop product line assets for their avionics software product line (SPL) and, recently, we encountered two major challenges regarding certification. Firstly, an individual product must be certified, but each may require a different certification level: there might be variations in the certification requirements according to specific system usage contexts. Secondly, certification involves not only product but also process, as standards such as DO-178B also assess the quality of the development process. In this paper, we propose to include a certification view during feature modelling to provide a better understanding of the relationships between features and a certification level required for each product. The experience of introducing certification into the design model of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) SPL is presented to illustrate some key ideas. We also describe the lessons we have learned from this experience.},

abstract = {Domain modeling is a key task in Software Product Line (SPL) development. We identified two popular modeling paradigms: Feature-Oriented Domain Modeling (FODM) and Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM). The representation of the domain model is crucial in SPL engineering, since domain models have a long lifecycle and represent the externalized organizational domain knowledge. For complex and heterogeneous domains, such as embedded systems, different representation techniques can be useful to describe different aspects of the system.This paper describes a multi-paradigm modeling approach which enables the combined representation of Feature models and Domain-Specific Languages (DSL). The main idea is to reduce the complexity of the model and, thus, to improve its usability and maintainability. The technical realization of the multi-paradigm modeling approach uses 3 types of constraints to connect different modeling paradigms. The constraint checking mechanism reuses existing technology in order to not re-invent the wheel.A case study describes the applicability of the approach in a real-life automotive project for hybrid electric vehicle control software (HybConS) and shows the improvement of this approach compared to single-paradigm modeling.},

abstract = {Software-intensive systems often consist of multiple components that interact to realize complex requirements. An additional dimension of complexity arises when one designs many variants of a system at once, that is, a software product line (SPL). We propose a scenario-based approach to design SPLs, based on a combination of Modal Sequence Diagrams (MSDs) and a feature model. It consists in associating every MSD to the set of variants that have to satisfy its specification. Variability constitutes a new source of complexity, which can lead to inconsistencies in the specification of one or multiple variants. It is therefore crucial to detect these inconsistencies, and to produce a controller for each variant that makes it behave so that it satisfies its specification. We present a new controller synthesis technique that checks the absence of inconsistencies in all variants at once, thereby more radically exploiting the similarities between them. Our method first translates the MSD specification into a variability-aware B\"{u}chi game, and then solves this game for all variants in a single execution. We implemented the approach in ScenarioTools, a software tool which we use to evaluate our algorithms against competing methods.},

The appropriateness of the choice can also change as an organisation's internal and external business environment context changes. In this paper we provide a management tool to help guide that decision making. We set out four broad types of business strategy and map these against four different types of reusable software development strategy. The four types of business strategy correspond to different business environments which are in turn characterised by different combinations of market predictability (low to high) and an organisation's ability to influence it (low to high). To demonstrate the framework as an analytical tool we have mapped examples of different organisations reusable software strategies and explained some circumstances in which that organisation's strategy may change.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) is a family of programs that are differentiated by features --- increments in functionality. Systematically testing an SPL is challenging because it requires running each test of a test suite against a combinatorial number of programs. Feature models capture dependencies among features and can (1) reduce the space of programs to test and (2) enable accurate categorization of failing tests as failures of programs or the tests themselves, not as failures due to illegal combinations of features. In practice, sadly, feature models are not always available.We introduce SPLif, the first approach for testing SPLs that does not require the a priori availability of feature models. Our insight is to use a profile of passing and failing test runs to quickly identify failures that are indicative of real problems in test or code rather than specious failures due to illegal feature combinations.Experimental results on five SPLs and one large configurable system (GCC) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. SPLif enabled the discovery of five news bugs in GCC, three of which have already been fixed.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) is an approach for reusing software artifacts for a specific domain. To improve products quality, verification and validation activities for SPL artifacts are necessary, thus defects are not propagated to derived products. The lack of techniques to exploit the inherited SPL reuse characteristics, mainly in early phases, provides an opportunity to investigate how to improve SPL quality. Perspective-Based Reading (PBR) has proven to be a feasible inspection technique, as it considers different scenarios and perspectives of reviewers of software artifacts. Therefore, in this paper, we specify and evaluate SMartyPerspective, a PBR technique to inspect UML-based SPL diagrams (use case, class, sequence, and component) and feature diagrams. SMartyPerspective comprises Domain Engineering perspectives: Product Manager, Domain Requirements Engineer, Domain Architect, Domain Developer, and Domain Asset Manager. We evaluated it by carrying out a TAM-based qualitative study with 19 participants with experience in SPL and software inspections. We also used coding to analyze the open questions. Obtained results provide initial evidence SMartyPerspective is feasible for inspecting its supported diagrams.},

abstract = {In model-driven software product line engineering (SPLE) the superset of products is developed over models. A feature model typically states the discriminating and common factors of the software. In annotative approaches model elements are associated with variability annotations which are boolean expressions over the features defining in which products the elements are visible. When the product line is defined over different models, the developer wants to annotate the model of one type and transform it to different representations, e.g., a (UML) class diagram into a relational database schema for establishing an object-relational mapping. Assigning the annotations manually to the target model is an error-prone and laborious task. In a black-box approach we automatically assign the correct annotations to the target model without analyzing the transformation specification. It is an easy task in the case of 1:1 mappings where the annotation of the source element is copied to the corresponding element in the target model. Typically this kind of information is available, e.g., in traces written during the transformation execution. In reality, more complex mappings are frequent but the correspondences harder to determine. Assuming a target model is already annotated with the annotation of 1:1 correspondences, a certain number of elements remains without annotations. This paper contributes strategies to determine missing annotations in partially annotated models. We compare a global include strategy with more sophisticated ones which take the model structure into account. Since we apply missing annotations locally on one model, we solve a general SPLE problem where completely annotated models reduce the manual user effort and are desirable for filtering.},

abstract = {In companies with a large portfolio of software or software-intensive products, functional overlaps are often perceived between independent products. In such situations it is advisable to systematically analyze the potential of systematic reuse and Software Product Lines. To this end, several domain analysis approaches, e.g., SEI Technical Probe, have been proposed to decide whether a set of products with a perceived functional overlap should be integrated into a single product line. Based on the principles of those approaches we devised our own approach. One important property is the inherent flexibility of the method to be able to apply it to four different application cases in industrial software products at ABB. In this paper we present our refined approach for domain analysis. The results and lessons learned are meant to support industrial researchers and practitioners alike. Moreover, the lessons learned highlight real-world findings concerning software reuse.},

abstract = {The use of non-systematic reuse techniques in Systems Engineering (SE) leads to the creation of legacy products comprised of legacy assets like software, hardware, and mechanical parts coupled with associated traceability links to requirements, testing artifacts, architectural fragments etc. The sheer number of different legacy assets and different technologies used to engineer such legacy products makes reverse engineering of PLs in this context a daunting task. One of the prerequisites for reverse engineering of PLs is to create a family model that captures implementation aspects of all the legacy products. In this paper, we evaluate the applicability of a modeling paradigm called Multi-Level Modeling, which is based on the class-instance relation, for the creation of a family model that captures all the implementation concerns in an SE PL. More specifically, we evaluate an approach called Multi-Level conceptual Theory (MLT) for capturing different legacy assets, their mutual relations and related variability information. Moreover, we map PL concepts like variants, presence conditions and product configurations to MLT concepts and provide formal interpretation of their semantics in the MLT framework. The illustrative example used throughout the paper comes from a real case from the automotive domain.},

abstract = {Establishing open software platforms is becoming increasingly important. Many vendors of large and well-known open platforms, such as Android or iOS, have successfully established huge ecosystems of platform extensions (apps). While such platforms are important role models, the practices and technologies employed by their vendors are often not applicable for smaller platform vendors, who have different goals and carry substantial legacy, such as an existing closed platform. Yet, many vendors start to open their platforms---for instance, when they alone cannot realize all incoming requirements anymore. Unfortunately, very few best practices exist to guide this opening process, especially for small and medium-scale industrial platforms with their specific solutions. We present a study of industrial organizations that successfully opened closed platforms. Using a survey, we identified 18 opened platforms, providing a broad picture, which is complemented with in-depth, qualitative insights from a case study of three organizations. We elicited the platforms' core characteristics, the organizations' opening strategies, as well as challenges and solutions. We believe that our results support practitioners seeking to open platforms, and researchers striving to build better methods and tools.},

abstract = {Software-product-line engineering (SPLE) has become a widely adopted concept to implement reusable source code. However, instead of using SPLE from the beginning (the proactive approach), a software product line (SPL) is often only introduced after a set of similar systems is already developed (the extractive approach). This can lead to additional costs, new bugs introduced by refactoring, and an overall inconsistent SPL. In particular, inconsistencies between the variability implemented in the source code and the one represented in a variability model can become a major problem. To address this issue, we propose the concept of variability management derivation: We aim to (semi-)automatically model features and their dependencies while developers implement variable source code to facilitate the initial development, reusability, and later maintainability of SPLs, utilizing the reactive approach. In this paper, we demonstrate our concept by means of preprocessors. However, we claim that it can be adapted for other SPLE implementation techniques to facilitate SPL development.},

This paper describes a successful industrial application of product line concepts based on the superset approach (aka 150%), where the success provided strong improvements in many aspects (e.g. product quality, amount of code to be maintained, time to delivery of new variants) but also introduced new challenges in the production of certain required product assets such as documentation or source code. We focus on the latter in this paper. We'll discuss the challenges which arose in the industrial use case from using the 150% superset approach with standard engineering programming languages and workflows and how the challenges have been solved. We evaluate our approach in a real industrial product line setting and the results show the effectiveness as well as the efficiency of the realized solution.},

This model not only shows the different components that have to be installed when deploying the system at the different levels established by the ERTMS/ETCS standards, but it also helps to identify and discuss specific issues, such as the borders between onboard and wayside equipment, different manufacturers of the subsystems, interoperability among systems developed at different levels, backward compatibility of trains equipped with higher level equipment running on lines equipped with lower level equipment, and evolution towards future trends of railway signalling. The feature model forms the basis for formal modelling of the behaviour of the critical components of the system and for evaluating the overall cost, effectiveness and sustainability, for example by adding cost and performance attributes to the feature model.},

abstract = {Ideally the variability of a product line is represented completely and correctly by its variability model. However, in practice additional variability is often represented on the level of the build system or in the code. Such a situation may lead to inconsistencies, where the actually realized variability does not fully correspond to the one described by the variability model. In this paper we focus on configuration mismatches, i.e., cases where the effective variability differs from the variability as it is represented by the variability model. While previous research has already shown that these situations still exist even today in well-analyzed product lines like Linux, so far it was unclear under what circumstances such issues occur in reality. In particular, it is open what types of configuration mismatches occur and how severe they are. Here, our contribution is to close this gap by presenting a detailed manual analysis of 80 configuration mismatches in the Linux 4.4.1 kernel and assess their criticality. We identify various categories of configuration issues and show that about two-thirds of the configuration mismatches may actually lead to kernel misconfigurations.},

abstract = {This paper reports our experience with software development based on the Software Product Line (SPL) approach employed for Clinical Instrument Integration Management Software (CIIMS). CIIMS is the system software which systemizes heterogeneous clinical instruments. These instruments require their particular management so that various parts of CIIMS are forced to be changed. This makes it difficult to create development plans to connect new instruments to CIIMS. In this paper we summarize a new estimate method called the Architecture Domain Matrix (ADM) method which effectively solved this problem in our experience. In ADM each architectural element is further decomposed into clinical operation flow elements and core assets of software are extracted from these elements. This method estimates the CIIMS commonality with precision and finally enables to successfully connect new instruments. In addition this method provides a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and supports development team building. WBS is generated by collecting all the changes for each operational flow element. A development team suitable for change is organized by taking into consideration all the changes for each architecture element. We integrated three different instruments into CIIMS in 18 months after applying this method to a real project and achieved 2.5 times greater productivity with the embedded software than that with our previous non-SPL process.},

Finally, the classifier assesses the similarity between a population of model fragments and the target feature being located to find the set of most suitable feature realizations.

However, manually recovering links in a large group of products requires significant costs and some links may be overlooked. Here, we propose a semi-automatic method to recover traceability links between requirements and source code in the same series of large software products. In order to support differences in representation between requirements and source code, we recover links by using the configuration management log as an intermediary. We refine the links by classifying requirements and code elements in terms of whether they are common or specific to the products. As a result of applying our method to real products that have 60KLOC, we have recovered valid traceability links within a reasonable amount of time. Automatic parts have taken 13 minutes 36 seconds, and non-automatic parts have taken about 3 hours, with a recall of 76.2% and a precision of 94.1%. Moreover, we recovered some links that were unknown to engineers. By recovering traceability links, software reusability will be improved, and software product line introduction will be facilitated.},

Finding a desirable variant is often difficult, due to the huge configuration space and usually conflicting objectives (e.g., lower cost and higher performance). This scenario can be characterized as a multi-objective optimization problem applied to SPLs. We address the problem using an exact and an approximate algorithm and compare their accuracy, time consumption, scalability, parameter setting requirements on five case studies with increasing complexity. Our empirical results show that (1) it is feasible to use exact techniques for small SPL multi-objective optimization problems, and (2) approximate methods can be used for large problems but require substantial effort to find the best parameter setting for acceptable approximation which can be ameliorated with known good parameter ranges. Finally, we discuss the tradeoff between accuracy and time consumption when using exact and approximate techniques for SPL multi-objective optimization and guide stakeholders to choose one or the other in practice.},

abstract = {Model-based Software Product Line (MSPL) engineering aims at deriving customized models corresponding to individual products of a family. MSPL approaches usually promote the joint use of a variability model, a base model expressed in a specific formalism, and a realization layer that maps variation points to model elements. The design space of an MSPL is extremely complex to manage for the engineer, since the number of variants may be exponential and the derived product models have to be conformant to numerous well-formedness and business rules. In this paper, the objective is to provide a way to generate MSPLs, called counterexamples, that can produce invalid product models despite a valid configuration in the variability model. We provide a systematic and automated process, based on the Common Variability Language (CVL), to randomly search the space of MSPLs for a specific formalism. We validate the effectiveness of this process for three formalisms at different scales (up to 247 metaclasses and 684 rules). We also explore and discuss how counterexamples could guide practitioners when customizing derivation engines, when implementing checking rules that prevent early incorrect CVL models, or simply when specifying an MSPL.},

abstract = {In software product line engineering, the customers mostly concentrate on the functionalities of the target product during product configuration. The quality attributes of a target product, such as security and performance, are often assessed until the final product is generated. However, it might be very costly to fix the problem if it is found that the generated product cannot satisfy the customers' quality requirements. Although the quality of a generated product will be affected by all the life cycles of product development, feature-based product configuration is the first stage where the estimation or prediction of the quality attributes should be considered. As we know, the key issue of predicting the quality attributes for a product configured from feature models is to measure the interdependencies between functional features and quality attributes. The current existing approaches have several limitations on this issue, such as requiring real products for the measurement or involving domain experts' efforts. To overcome these limitations, we propose a systematic approach of modeling quality attributes in feature models based on domain experts' judgments using the analytic hierarchical process (AHP) and conducting quality aware product configuration based on the captured quality knowledge. Domain experts' judgments are adapted to avoid generating the real products for quality evaluation, and AHP is used to reduce domain experts' efforts involved in the judgments. A prototype tool is developed to implement the concepts of the proposed approach, and a formal evaluation is carried out based on a large-scale case study.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) has arisen as an approach for developing a family of software-intensive systems at lower costs, within shorter time, and with higher quality. In particular, SPL is supported by a product line architecture (sometimes also referred to as reference architecture) that captures the architectures of a product family. From another perspective, a special type of architecture that contains knowledge about a specific domain has been increasingly investigated, resulting in the research area of Reference Architecture. In spite of the positive impact of this type of architecture on reuse and productivity, the use of the knowledge contained in existing reference architectures in order to develop SPL has not been widely explored yet. The main contribution of this paper is to present a process, named ProSA-RA2PLA, that systematizes the use of reference architectures for building product line architectures. To illustrate the application of this process, we have built a product line architecture for an SPL of software testing tools using a reference architecture of that domain. Based on initial results, we have observed that benefits can be achieved, mainly regarding improvement in reuse and productivity to develop SPL.},

abstract = {We present a case study of migrating a legacy language infrastructure and its codebase to a projectional language workbench. Our subject is the generator tool ADS used for generating COBOL code for critical software systems. We decompose the ADS language into smaller sub-languages, which we implement as individual DSLs in the projectional language workbench JetBrains Meta Programming System (MPS). Our focus is on ADS' preprocessor sub-language, used to realize static variability by conditionally including or parameterizing target code. The modularization of ADS supports future extensions and tailoring the language infrastructure to the needs of individual customers. We re-implement the generation process of target code as chained model-to-model and model-to-text transformations. For migrating existing ADS code, we implement an importer relying on a parser in order to create a model in MPS. We validate the approach using an ADS codebase for handling car registrations in the Netherlands. Our case study shows the feasibility and benefits (e.g., language extensibility and modern editors) of the migration, but also smaller caveats (e.g., small syntax adaptations, the necessity of import tools, and providing training to developers). Our experiences are useful for practitioners attempting a similar migration of legacy generators to a projectional language workbench.},

abstract = {Modern conflict-driven clause-learning (CDCL) Boolean SAT solvers provide efficient automatic analysis of real-world feature models (FM) of systems ranging from cars to operating systems. It is well-known that solver-based analysis of real-world FMs scale very well even though SAT instances obtained from such FMs are large, and the corresponding analysis problems are known to be NP-complete. To better understand why SAT solvers are so effective, we systematically studied many syntactic and semantic characteristics of a representative set of large real-world FMs. We discovered that a key reason why large real-world FMs are easy-to-analyze is that the vast majority of the variables in these models are unrestricted, i.e., the models are satisfiable for both true and false assignments to such variables under the current partial assignment. Given this discovery and our understanding of CDCL SAT solvers, we show that solvers can easily find satisfying assignments for such models without too many backtracks relative to the model size, explaining why solvers scale so well. Further analysis showed that the presence of unrestricted variables in these real-world models can be attributed to their high-degree of variability. Additionally, we experimented with a series of well-known nonbacktracking simplifications that are particularly effective in solving FMs. The remaining variables/clauses after simplifications, called the core, are so few that they are easily solved even with backtracking, further strengthening our conclusions. We explain the connection between our findings and backdoors, an idea posited by theorists to explain the power of SAT solvers. This connection strengthens our hypothesis that SAT-based analysis of FMs is easy. In contrast to our findings, previous research characterizes the difficulty of analyzing randomly-generated FMs in terms of treewidth. Our experiments suggest that the difficulty of analyzing real-world FMs cannot be explained in terms of treewidth.},

Such architectures often emerge from legacy code, but, unfortunately creating feature models from large, legacy systems is a long and arduous task.We address the problem of automatic synthesis of feature models from propositional constraints. We show that this problem is NP-hard. We design efficient techniques for synthesis of models from respectively CNF and DNF formulas, showing a 10- to 1000-fold performance improvement over known techniques for realistic benchmarks.Our algorithms are the first known techniques that are efficient enough to be applied to dependencies extracted from real systems, opening new possibilities of creating reverse engineering and model management tools for variability models.

abstract = {As the complexity and variety of systems and software products have increased, the ability to manage their variability effectively and efficiently became crucial. To this end, variability can be specified either as an integral part of the development artifacts or in a separate orthogonal variability model. Lately, orthogonal variability models attract a lot of attention due to the fact that they do not require changing the complexity of the development artifacts and can be used in conjunction with different development artifacts. Despite this attention and to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study examined the comprehensibility of orthogonal variability models.In this work, we conducted an exploratory experiment to examine potential comprehension problems in two common orthogonal variability modeling languages, namely, Common Variability Language (CVL) and Orthogonal Variability Model (OVM). We examined the comprehensibility of the variability models and their relations to the development artifacts for novice users. To measure comprehensibility we used comprehension score (i.e., percentage of correct solution), time spent to complete tasks, and participants' perception of difficulty of different model constructs. The results showed high comprehensibility of the variability models, but low comprehensibility of the relations between the variability models and the development artifacts. Although the comprehensibility of CVL and OVM was similar in terms of comprehension score and time spent to complete tasks, novice users perceived OVM as more difficult to comprehend.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) life cycle comprises a set of essential activities. Variability Management (VM) is one of its most important activities to the success of an SPL, especially those based on UML, as the solution space encompasses different diagrams and perspectives on variability. However, the lack of tools to support UML-based SPLs reflects difficulties in adopting this approach. This scenario motivated the development of SMartyModeling, an environment for engineering UML-based SPL. The SMartyModeling architecture was instantiated based on VMTools-RA, an existing reference architecture for software variability tools. VMTools-RA describes architectural requirements, elements and views on software variability, which aid one to instantiate variability tool architectures. The instantiation process started from the identification of requirements, selection of elements, modules, and visions of VMTools-RA, planning and design of the architectural solutions, implementation of modules and organization of features. We then analyzed the feasibility of adopting VMTools-RA for instantiating an specific tool architecture. In this sense, such instantiation is part of the development process of SMartyModeling, which includes the main activities related to VM. We also empirically evaluated SMartyModeling in three ways: (i) a field study to analyze the instantiation process and the decisions taken; (ii) a comparative experiment analyzing efficiency and effectiveness of SMartyModeling in relation to a general purpose UML tool; and (iii) an evaluation of aspects related to perceived ease of use and perceived usability. The results of such evaluations provide initial evidence VMTools-RA is feasible to instantiate specific architectures and SMartyModeling is feasible to support to VM for UML-based SPLs.},

abstract = {Customizing web services according to users' individual functional and non-functional requirements has become increasingly difficult as the number of users increases. This paper introduces a new way to customize and verify composite web services by incorporating a software product-line engineering approach into web-service composition. The approach uses a partitioning similar to that between domain engineering and application engineering in the product-line context. It specifies the options that the user can select and constructs the resulting web-service compositions. By first creating a web-service composition search space that satisfies the common requirements and then querying the search space as the user selects values for the parameters of variation, we provide a more efficient way to customize web services. A decision model, illustrated with examples from an emergency-response application, is created to interact with the customers and ensure the consistency of their specifications. The capability to reuse the composition search space may also help improve the quality and reliability of the composite services and reduce the cost of re-verifying the same compositions.},

abstract = {Many companies offer a palette of similar software products though they do not necessarily have a Software Product Line (SPL). Rather, they start building and selling individual products which they then adapt, customize and extend for different customers. As the number of product variants increases, these companies then face the severe problem of having to maintain them all. Software Product Lines can be helpful here - not so much as a platform for creating new products but as a means of maintaining the existing ones with their shared features. Here, an important first step is to determine where features are implemented in the source code and in what product variants. To this end, this paper presents a novel technique for deriving the traceability between features and code in product variants by matching code overlaps and feature overlaps. This is a difficult problem because a feature's implementation not only covers its basic functionality (which does not change across product variants) but may include code that deals with feature interaction issues and thus changes depending on the combination of features present in a product variant. We empirically evaluated the approach on three non-trivial case studies of different sizes and domains and found that our approach correctly identifies feature to code traces except for code that traces to multiple disjunctive features, a rare case involving less than 1% of the code.},

abstract = {Business calculations like break-even, return on investment, or cost are essential in many domains to support decision making while configuring products. For instance, customers and sales people need to estimate and compare the business value of different product variants. Some product line approaches provide initial support, e.g., by defining quality attributes in relation to features. However, an approach that allows domain engineers to easily define business calculations together with variability models is still lacking. In product configuration, calculation results need to be instantly presented to end users after making configuration choices. Further, due to the often high number of calculations, the presentation of calculation results to end users can be challenging. These challenges cannot be addressed by integrating off-the-shelf applications performing the calculations with product line tools. We thus present an approach based on dedicated calculation models that are related to variability models. Our approach seamlessly integrates business calculations with product configuration and provides support for formatting calculations and calculation results. We use the DOPLER tool suite to deploy calculations together with variability models to end users in product configuration. We evaluate the expressiveness and practical relevance of the approach by investigating the development of business calculations for 15 product lines from the domain of industrial automation.},

The identified model fragments may not be seen as recognizable units by the application engineers. We propose to identify model patterns by human-in-the-loop and conceptualize them as reusable model fragments. The approach provides the means to identify and extract those model patterns and further apply them to existing product models. Model fragments obtained by applying our approach seem to perform better than mechanically found ones. It turns out that the repetition of a fragment does not guarantee its relevance as reusable asset for the SPL engineers and vice versa, a fragment that has not been repeated yet, may be relevant as a reusable asset. We have validated these ideas with our industrial partner BSH, an induction hobs manufacturer that generates the firmware of their products from a model-driven SPL.},

As the manual preparation of feature models is a tedious and labour-intensive activity, some techniques have been proposed to automatically generate boolean feature models from product descriptions. However, none of these techniques is capable of synthesizing feature attributes and relations among attributes, despite the huge relevance of attributes for documenting software product lines. In this paper, we introduce for the first time an algorithmic and parametrizable approach for computing a legal and appropriate hierarchy of features, including feature groups, typed feature attributes, domain values and relations among these attributes. We have performed an empirical evaluation by using both randomized configuration matrices and real-world examples. The initial results of our evaluation show that our approach can scale up to matrices containing 2,000 attributed features, and 200,000 distinct configurations in a couple of minutes.},

abstract = {Microservices is an emerging industrial technique to promote better modularization and management of small and autonomous services. Microservice architecture is widely used to overcome the limitations of monolithic legacy systems, such as limited maintainability and reusability. Migration to a microservice architecture is increasingly becoming the focus of academic research. However, there is little knowledge on how microservices are extracted from legacy systems in practice. Among these limitations, there is a lack of understanding if variability is considered useful along the microservice extraction from a configurable system. In order to address this gap, we performed an exploratory study composed of two phases. Firstly, we conducted an online survey with 26 specialists that contributed to the migration of existing systems to a microservice architecture. Secondly, we performed individual interviews with seven survey participants. A subset of the participants (13 out of 26) dealt with systems with variability during the extraction, which stated that variability is a key criterion for structuring the microservices. Moreover, variability in the legacy system is usually implemented with simple mechanisms. Finally, initial evidence points out that microservices extraction can increase software customization.},

During feature-model evolution, for information hiding, and for feature-model analyses, it is often necessary to remove certain features from a model. As the crude deletion of features can have undesirable effects on their dependencies, dependency-preserving algorithms, known as feature-model slicing, have been proposed. However, current algorithms do not perform well when removing a high number of features from large feature models. Therefore, we propose an efficient algorithm for feature-model slicing based on logical resolution and the minimization of logical formulas. We empirically evaluate the scalability of our algorithm on a number of feature models and find that our algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms.},

abstract = {Context: It is important for Product Line Architectures (PLA) to remain stable accommodating evolutionary changes of stakeholder's requirements. Otherwise, architectural modifications may have to be propagated to products of a product line, thereby increasing maintenance costs. A key challenge is that several features are likely to exert a crosscutting impact on the PLA decomposition, thereby making it more difficult to preserve its stability in the presence of changes. Some researchers claim that the use of aspects can ameliorate instabilities caused by changes in crosscutting features. Hence, it is important to understand which aspect-oriented (AO) and non-aspect-oriented techniques better cope with PLA stability through evolution. Objective: This paper evaluates the positive and negative change impact of component and aspect based design on PLAs. The objective of the evaluation is to assess how aspects and components promote PLA stability in the presence of various types of evolutionary change. To support a broader analysis, we also evaluate the PLA stability of a hybrid approach (i.e. combined use of aspects and components) against the isolated use of component-based, OO, and AO approaches. Method: An quantitative and qualitative analysis of PLA stability which involved four different implementations of a PLA: (i) an OO implementation, (ii) an AO implementation, (iii) a component-based implementation, and (iv) a hybrid implementation where both components and aspects are employed. Each implementation has eight releases and they are functionally equivalent. We used conventional metrics suites for change impact and modularity to measure the architecture stability evaluation of the 4 implementations. Results: The combination of aspects and components promotes superior PLA resilience than the other PLAs in most of the circumstances. Conclusion: It is concluded that the combination of aspects and components supports the design of high cohesive and loosely coupled PLAs. It also contributes to improve modularity by untangling feature implementation.},

abstract = {Efficient configuration management system is crucial for the success of any software product line (SPL). Due to ever changing needs of customers, SPL undergoes constant changes that are to be tracked in real time. In the context of customer-driven development, anticipation and change management are to be given paramount importance. It demands implementation of software variability that drives home changed, extended and customized configurations besides economy at scale. Moreover, the emergence of distributed technologies, the unprecedented growth of component based, serviceoriented systems throw ever increasing challenges to software product line configuration management. Derivation of a new product is a dynamic process in software product line that should consider functionality and quality attributes. Very few approaches are found on configuration management (CM) of SPL though CM is enough matured for traditional products. They are tailor made and inadequate to provide a general solution. Stated differently, a comprehensive approach for SPL configuration management and product derivation is still to be desired. In this paper, we proposed a framework that guides in doing so besides helping in SPL definitions in generic way. Our framework facilitates SPL configuration management and product derivation based on critical path analysis, weight computation and feedback. We proposed two algorithms namely Quality Driven Product Derivation (QDPD) and Composition Analysis algorithm for generating satisfied compositions and to find best possible composition respectively. The usage of weights and critical path analysis improves quality of product derivation. The framework is extensible and flexible thus it can be leveraged with variability-aware design patterns and ontology. We built a prototype that demonstrates the proof of concept. We tested our approach with Dr. School product line. The results reveal that the framework supports configuration management of SPL and derivation of high quality product in the product line. We evaluated results with ground truth to establish significance of our implementation},

abstract = {Features are commonly used to describe functional and nonfunctional aspects of software. To effectively evolve and reuse features, their location in software assets has to be known. However, locating features is often difficult given their crosscutting nature. Once implemented, the knowledge about a feature's location quickly deteriorates, requiring expensive recovering of these locations. Manually recording and maintaining traceability information is generally considered expensive and error-prone. In this paper, we argue to the contrary and hypothesize that such information can be effectively embedded into software assets, and that arising costs will be amortized by the benefits of this information later during development. We test this hypothesis in a study where we simulate the development of a product line of cloned/forked projects using a lightweight code annotation approach. We identify annotation evolution patterns and measure the cost and benefit of these annotations. Our results show that not only the cost of adding annotations, but also that of maintaining them is small compared to the actual development cost. Embedding the annotations into assets significantly reduced the maintenance cost because they naturally co-evolve with the assets. Our results also show that a majority of these annotations provides a benefit for feature-related code maintenance tasks, such as feature propagation and migrating clones into a platform.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineering allows the derivation of products tailored to stakeholders’ needs through the setting of a large number of configuration options. Unfortunately, options and their interactions create a huge configuration space which is either intractable or too costly to explore exhaustively. Instead of covering all products, machine learning (ML) approximates the set of acceptable products (e.g., successful builds, passing tests) out of a training set (a sample of configurations). However, ML techniques can make prediction errors yielding non-acceptable products wasting time, energy and other resources. We apply adversarial machine learning techniques to the world of SPLs and craft new configurations faking to be acceptable configurations but that are not and vice-versa. It allows to diagnose prediction errors and take appropriate actions. We develop two adversarial configuration generators on top of state-of-the-art attack algorithms and capable of synthesizing configurations that are both adversarial and conform to logical constraints. We empirically assess our generators within two case studies: an industrial video synthesizer (MOTIV) and an industry-strength, open-source Web-app configurator (JHipster). For the two cases, our attacks yield (up to) a 100% misclassification rate without sacrificing the logical validity of adversarial configurations. This work lays the foundations of a quality assurance framework for ML-based SPLs.},

abstract = {Tool support that checks for configuration errors and generates product parts from configurations can significantly improve on product derivation in product line engineering. Up to now, however, derivation tools commonly disregard the staged derivation process. They do not restrict configuration consistency checks to process entities such as configuration stages, stakeholders, or build tasks. As a result, constraints that are only valid for certain process entities must either be checked permanently, leading to false positive errors, or one must refrain from defining them at all.This paper contributes a light-weight approach to provide tailored tool support for staged product derivation. Compared to previous approaches, it is not tied to a single configuration mechanism (e.g., feature modeling), and also accounts for the stakeholders involved and the build tasks that generate product parts. First, the product line engineer describes the derivation process in a concise model. Then, based on constraint checks on the configuration (e.g., a feature model configuration) that are linked to the modeled entities, comprehensive tool support can be provided: Configuration actions can be guided and restricted depending on the configuring stakeholder in a fine-grained manner, and constraints attached to a build task will only be checked if it actually shall be executed. Finally, in combination with previous work, the paper provides evidence that the approach is applicable to legacy product lines in a light-weight manner and that it technically scales to thousands of constraint checks.},

The proposed integration is implemented as Eclipse plugin. It provides support for importing backend folders and files within the method library of EPF Composer, resolving problems with the files for variability management with the BVR Tool, and exporting back the resolved process models to the EPF Composer. The applicability of the implemented plugin is demonstrated by engineering an ECSS-E-ST-40C compliant SoPL for the space projects and applications.},

abstract = {In Software Product Line (SPL) engineering, software products are build in families rather than individually. Many critical software are nowadays build as SPLs and most of them obey hard real-time requirements. Formal methods for verifying SPLs are thus crucial and actively studied. The verification problem for SPL is, however, more complicated than for individual systems; the large number of different software products multiplies the complexity of SPL model-checking. Recently, promising model-checking approaches have been developed specifically for SPLs. They leverage the commonality between the products to reduce the verification effort. However, none of them considers real time.In this paper, we combine existing SPL verification methods with established model-checking procedures for real-time systems. We introduce Featured Timed Automata (FTA), a formalism that extends the classical Timed Automata with constructs for modelling variability. We show that FTA model-checking can be achieved through a smart combination of real-time and SPL model checking.},

abstract = {Maintenance in the context of SPLs is a topic of interest, and that still needs further investigation. There are several ways to evaluate the maintainability of a feature model (FM), one of which is a manual or automated analysis of quality measures. However, the use of measures does not allow to evaluate the FM quality as a whole, as each measure considers a specific characteristic of FM. In general, the measures have wide ranges of values and do not have a clear definition of what is appropriate and inappropriate. In this context, the goal of this work is to investigate the use of machine learning techniques to classify the feature model maintainability. The research questions investigated in the study were: (i) how could machine learning techniques aid to classify FMs maintainability; and, (ii) which FM classification model has the best accuracy and precision. In this work, we proposed an approach for FM maintainability classification using machine learning technics. For that, we used a dataset of 15 FM maintainability measures calculated for 326 FMs, and we used machine learning algorithms to clustering. After this, we used thresholds to evaluate the general maintainability of each cluster. With this, we built 5 maintainability classification models that have been evaluated with the accuracy and precision metrics.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) has been successfully consolidated as an approach for systematic reuse. The adoption of the SPL approach aims at increasing the reuse of requirements and artifacts, thus reusing documents, source code and artifacts and ensuring better quality control to software production in a large-scale. One of the essential activities for SPL management is the modeling of variability. Variability modeling in UML-based SPL has been carried out mostly using the UML Profiling mechanism, in which new stereotypes and tagged values are created for such purpose. The available option in general-purpose UML tools for exporting UML models is through XMI files, standardized by OMG. This option is important to process XMI files in particular environments or tools, for example, managing variabilities, generating product configurations from an SPL, and even collecting metrics, and estimating SPLs. However, different versions, tool restrictions, and different file standards compromise operations involving XMI files. In this scenario, the industry has increasingly required the supporting tools for the SPL approach. However, the current support tools are mainly restricted to the problem space based on feature modeling and present problems with data integration with other tools. Therefore, we developed SMartyModeling, an environment for engineering UML-based SPLs in which variabilities are modeled as stereotypes using any UML compliant profile. This paper presents an overview of SMartyModeling, describing its motivation, main components, and available features.},

In order to develop differing but still similar model-based systems, these models are often copied and modified according to the changed requirements. As the variability between these different models is not documented, issues arise during maintenance. For example, applying patches becomes a tedious task because errors have to be fixed in all of the created models and no information about modified and unchanged parts exists. In this paper, we present an approach to analyze related models and determine the variability between them. This analysis provides crucial information about the variability (i.e., changed parts, additional parts, and parts without any modification) between the models in order to create family models. The particular focus is the analysis of models containing components with differing interfaces.},

Additionally, due to the emergence of new computing environments like autonomous systems (e.g., ubiquitous computing and the Internet of Things), there is increasing demand for dynamic adaptations of core assets, and this often needs to be managed with minimum human intervention. We propose an approach for managing a distributed feature model in order to facilitate the adaptation of self-adaptive dynamic software product lines (DSPLs). In addition, our approach allows the change of behaviours to promote the long lifecycle of self-adaptive DSPL. The case study applied in this paper is a baby care system (BCS). BCS assists people to monitor a baby while they are sleeping. We tested our BCS in the following scenarios: adding features, removing features and changing behaviours. All these scenarios showed that it is possible to use our approach to self-adapt DSPLs.},

abstract = {Preprocessors support the diversification of software products with #ifdefs, but also require additional effort from developers to maintain and understand variable code. We conjecture that #ifdefs cause developers to produce more vulnerable code because they are required to reason about multiple features simultaneously and maintain complex mental models of dependencies of configurable code.We extracted a variational call graph across all configurations of the Linux kernel, and used configuration complexity metrics to compare vulnerable and non-vulnerable functions considering their vulnerability history. Our goal was to learn about whether we can observe a measurable influence of configuration complexity on the occurrence of vulnerabilities.Our results suggest, among others, that vulnerable functions have higher variability than non-vulnerable ones and are also constrained by fewer configuration options. This suggests that developers are inclined to notice functions appear in frequently-compiled product variants. We aim to raise developers' awareness to address variability more systematically, since configuration complexity is an important, but often ignored aspect of software product lines.},

The simulation is controlled by a feedback loop and a reasoning engine that operates on the functional and non-functional requirements. The paper contribution is threefold. First, REFAS allows developers to evaluate and improve requirements models through their simulation capabilities. Second, REFAS provides rich feedback in its interactive simulations for the human modeller to make informed decisions to improve her model. Third, REFAS automates the generation of simulation scenarios required to verify the model adequacy and correctness. We evaluate our contribution by comparing the application of REFAS to a case study used in other approaches.},

During their development several engineers of different disciplines are involved, such as mechanical, electrical and software engineering. Each engineer focuses on specific system aspects to be developed. To enable an efficient development, product lines especially with feature models for variability modeling are promising technologies. In order to reduce the complexity of both feature models and development process, views on feature models can be applied. The use of views for filtering purposes constitutes an established method. However, views also enable further options missing in current approaches, such as evaluations regarding requirements, including non-functional ones. This paper presents an approach for evaluation across multiple views to enable collaborative development for developers who focus on different system aspects.

abstract = {Testing every member of a product line individually is often impracticable due to large number of possible product configurations. Thus, feature models are frequently used to generate samples, i.e., subsets of product configurations under test. Besides the extensively studied combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) approach for coverage-driven sample generation, only few approaches exist so far adopting mutation testing to emulate faults in feature models to be detected by a sample. In this paper, we present a mutation-based sampling framework for fault-based product-line testing. We define a comprehensive catalog of atomic mutation operators on the graphical representation of feature models. This way, we are able (1) to also define complex mutation operators emulating more subtle faults, and (2) to classify operators semantically, e.g., to avoid redundant and equivalent mutants. We further introduce similarity-based mutant selection and higher order mutation strategies to reduce testing efforts. Our implementation is based on the graph transformation engine Henshin and is evaluated concerning effectiveness/efficiency trade-offs.},

abstract = {A scalable approach for software product line testing is required due to the size and complexity of industrial product lines. In this paper, we present a specialized algorithm (called ICPL) for generating covering arrays from feature models. ICPL makes it possible to apply combinatorial interaction testing to software product lines of the size and complexity found in industry. For example, ICPL allows pair-wise testing to be readily applied to projects of about 7,000 features and 200,000 constraints, the Linux Kernel, one of the largest product lines where the feature model is available. ICPL is compared to three of the leading algorithms for t-wise covering array generation. Based on a corpus of 19 feature models, data was collected for each algorithm and feature model when the algorithm could finish 100 runs within three days. These data are used for comparing the four algorithms. In addition to supporting large feature models, ICPL is quick, produces small covering arrays and, even though it is non-deterministic, produces a covering array of a similar size within approximately the same time each time it is run with the same feature model.},

abstract = {Software Product-Line (SPL) model checking has reached an adequate level of efficiency and expressiveness to be applied on real-world cases. Yet a major challenge remains: model checkers should consist of black-box tools that do not require in-depth expertise to be used. In particular, it is essential to provide engineers with easy-to-learn languages to model both the behaviour of their SPL and the properties to check. In this paper, we propose a framework to build customized product-line verifiers modularly. Our extensible architecture allows one to plug new modelling languages or verifications algorithms without modifying other parts of it. It also provides means of representing and reasoning on variability that can facilitate the development of other SPL quality assurance techniques. We illustrate the benefits of our approach by detailing how we created a new domain-specific SPL modelling language and linked it to our tool.},

abstract = {Industrial product lines are typically maintained for a long time and evolve continuously to address changing requirements and new technologies. Already derived products often have to be re-derived after such changes to benefit from new and updated features. Product line engineers thus frequently need to analyze the impact of changes to variability models to prevent unexpected changes of re-derived products. In this paper we present a tool-supported approach that informs engineers about the impacts of variability model changes on existing products. Regression tests are used to determine whether existing product configurations and generated product outputs can be re-derived without unexpected effects. We evaluate the feasibility of the approach based on changes observed in a real-world software product line. More specifically, we show how our approach helps engineers performing specific evolution tasks to analyze the change impacts on existing products. We also evaluate the performance and scalability of our approach. Our results show that variability change impact analyses can be automated using model regression testing and can help reducing the gap between domain engineering and application engineering.},

Furthermore, many deployments on different heterogeneous platforms are possible. In this paper we present a technological solution to assist industrial practitioners in producing a safe and secure solution out of numerous architectural variants. First, we introduce a pattern technology that provides correct-by-construction deployment models through the reuse of modeling artifacts organized in a catalog. Second, we develop a variability solution, connected to the pattern technology and based on an extension of the common variability language, for supporting the synthesis of model-based architectural variants. This paper describes a live demonstration of an industrial effort seeking to bridge the gap between variability modeling and model-based systems engineering practices. We illustrate the tooling support with an industrial case study (a secure radio platform).},

abstract = {Embedded software systems, e.g. automotive, robotic or automation systems are highly configurable and consist of many software components being available in different variants and versions. To identify the degree of reusability between these different occurrences of a component, it is necessary to determine the functional backward and forward compatibility between them. Based on this information it is possible to identify in which system context a component can be replaced safely by another version, e.g. exchanging an older component, or variant, e.g. introducing new features, to achieve the same functionality.This paper presents a model checking approach to determine behavioral compatibility of Simulink models, obtained from different component variants or during evolution. A prototype for automated compatibility checking demonstrates its feasibility. In addition implemented optimizations make the analysis more efficient, when the compared variants or versions are structurally similar.A case study on a driver assistance system provided by Daimler AG shows the effectiveness of the approach to automatically compare Simulink components.},

abstract = {Software products are rarely developed without providing different sets of features to better meet varying user needs, whether through tiered products as part of a product line or different subscription levels for software as a service (SaaS). Software product line approaches for generating and maintaining a family of different variants of software products address such needs for variation quite well. Real-world human-intensive systems (HISs) display similar needs for families of variants. A key contribution of this paper is to show how many of these needs can be rigorously and systematically addressed by adapting established techniques from system and software product line engineering (SPLE).In this paper, we present an approach for creating such families by explicitly modeling variation in HISs. We focus on two kinds of variation we have previously described in other work---functional detail variation and service variation. We describe a prototype system that is able to meet the need for these kinds of variation within an existing modeling framework and present a case study of the application of our prototype system to generate a family in an HIS from the domain of elections. Our approach also demonstrates how to perform model-checking of this family to discover whether any variants in the family may violate specified system requirements.},

Designers often have two or more alternatives, which must be compared and put into context before a decision is made. The challenge becomes even more complex for dynamic software product lines, where domain designers have to take runtime variations into consideration as well. To address the problem we propose extensions to an architectural reasoning framework with constructs/artifacts to define and model a domain's scope and dynamic variability. The extended reasoning framework encapsulates knowledge to understand and reason about domain quality behavior and self-adaptation as a primary variability mechanism. The framework is demonstrated for a self-configuration property, self-upgradability on an educational product-line.},

abstract = {Software process improvement has always been an essential part of software projects. Current market trends and the rapid pace of changing requirements demand fast development and adaptability. Agile software development is a popular possibility to react on these trends. Implementing agile practices promises for example a shorter time-to-market, satisfied customers and increased software quality. Consequently many companies strive for an integration of agile methods or for an agile transformation.High-technological environments such as the automotive domain also want to benefit from the advantages promised by agile software development. Even more than smaller companies, these large ones have to deal with software systems getting more and more complex. One established solution facing this problem is an effective and managed way to reuse software at least partially. Software product lines provide an efficient way to manage software reuse and to handle the high complexity. Consequently, they are widely distributed in large and high-technological environments.In most companies in the automotive domain, software product lines are already present and agile development methods should be introduced. Hence, there is a need for a transformation model preserving the benefits of software product lines. We conducted a literature review to achieve an overview and a better understanding of agile transformation models in large companies. In total, we analyzed 367 papers. None of them addresses the agile transformation in large companies with existing software product lines. In consideration of this research gap, we propose a transformation model preserving the benefits of already existing models and extending aspects which are important for existing software product lines.},

abstract = {Although most programming languages naturally share several language features, they are typically implemented as a monolithic product. Language features cannot be plugged and unplugged from a language and reused in another language. Some modular approaches to language construction do exist but composing language features requires a deep understanding of its implementation hampering their use. The choose and pick approach from software product lines provides an easy way to compose a language out of a set of language features. However, current approaches to language product lines are not sufficient enough to cope with the complexity and evolution of real world programming languages. In this work, we propose a general light-weight bottom-up approach to automatically extract a feature model from a set of tagged language components. We applied this approach to the Neverlang language development framework and developed the AiDE tool to guide language developers towards a valid language composition. The approach has been evaluated on a decomposed version of Javascript to highlight the benefits of such a language product line.},

abstract = {Application engineers frequently create customer-specific products in two stages: the required software components are first selected to create an initial product which is then evolved by refining the selected features and adapting the code to meet the customers' requirements. For instance, developers frequently set configuration options in the code to adjust the product. However, given that such changes are often necessary in the entire code base it is hard to know which part of the code is still relevant for the chosen configuration options. This means that engineers need to understand and maintain a lot of code that is potentially inactive in a particular product variant. Existing approaches provide only partial solutions: for instance, feature-to-code mappings do not adequately consider complex code dependencies of the implemented features. Static analysis techniques provide better results but usually do not consider variability aspects. We present an approach to automatically identify inactive code in product variants using a configuration-aware code analysis technique. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by customizing it to a product line of an industry partner in the domain of industrial automation. We further evaluate the approach to demonstrate its effectiveness, accuracy, and performance.},

abstract = {A business subject who wishes to enter an established technological market is required to accurately analyse the features of the products of the different competitors. Such features are normally accessible through natural language (NL) brochures, or NL Web pages, which describe the products to potential customers. Building a feature model that hierarchically summarises the different features available in competing products can bring relevant benefits in market analysis. A company can easily visualise existing features, and reason about aspects that are not covered by the available solutions. However, designing a feature model starting from publicly available documents of existing products is a time consuming and error-prone task. In this paper, we present two tools, namely Commonality Mining Tool (CMT) and Feature Diagram Editor (FDE), which can jointly support the feature model definition process. CMT allows mining common and variant features from NL descriptions of existing products, by leveraging a natural language processing (NLP) approach based on contrastive analysis, which allows identifying domain-relevant terms from NL documents. FDE takes the commonalities and variabilities extracted by CMT, and renders them in a visual form. Moreover, FDE allows the graphical design and refinement of the final feature model, by means of an intuitive GUI.},

abstract = {Nowadays, embedded systems are gaining importance. At the same time, the development of their software is increasing its complexity, having to deal with quality, cost, and time‐to‐market issues among others. With stringent quality requirements such as performance, early verification and validation become critical in these systems. In this regard, advanced development paradigms such as model‐driven engineering and software product line engineering bring considerable benefits to the development and validation of embedded system software. However, these benefits come at the cost of increasing process complexity. This work presents a process based on UML and MARTE for the analysis of embedded model‐driven product lines. It specifies the tasks, the involved roles, and the workproducts that form the process and how it is integrated in the more general development process. Existing tools that support the tasks to be performed in the process are also described. A classification of such tools and a study of traceability among them are provided, allowing engineering teams to choose the most adequate chain of tools to support the process.

"Success" for an ecosystem may be judged primarily in economic terms, but may alternatively be assessed with regard to other qualities, such as reduced time-to-market, widespread use, or adaptability. Example successful ecosystems include iOS apps, Photoshop Lightroom plug-ins, RESTful web services, and numerous e-commerce systems. This talk will examine the critical role that architectural styles play in making and sustaining successful ecosystems. Architectural styles are sets of design decisions applicable to a particular context, constraining development within that context, and yielding beneficial qualities. Styles carry lessons learned through experience, aid communication, provide vocabulary, and speed design. Most importantly, they can be key elements in maintaining conceptual integrity. After examining the role of styles in several ecosystems, the talk will focus on the particular problems of ecosystems in which some participants may be malicious, or where high degrees of customization or adaptability are required.},

abstract = {The benefits offered by cloud technologies have compelled enterprises to adopt the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model for their enterprise software needs. A SaaS has to be configured or customized to suit the specific requirements of every enterprise that subscribes to it. IT service providers have to deal with the problem of testing many such configurations created for different enterprises. The software gets upgraded periodically and the configurations need to be tested on an ongoing basis to ensure business continuity. In order to run the testing organization efficiently, it is imperative that the test cycle is automated. Developing automated test scripts for a large number of configurations is a non-trivial task because differences across them may range from a few user interface changes to business process level changes. We propose an approach that combines the benefits of model driven engineering and variability modeling to address this issue. The approach comprises of the Enterprise Software Test Modeling Language to model the test cases. We use the Common Variability Language to model variability in the test cases and apply model transformations on a base model to generate a test model for each configuration. These models are used to generate automated test scripts for all the configurations. We describe the test modelling language and an experiment which shows that the approach can be used to automatically generate variations in automated test scripts.},

When implementing a feature, a developer has to know which code fragments of other (already implemented) features are accessible in each program variant in which the feature is included. Especially for composition-based implementation techniques, in which the code is implemented in separated modules, it is an exhausting and error-prone task to find safely accessible code fragments of other modules. State-of-the-art tool support, such as product-line type checkers, detect errors a posteriori (i.e., during compilation), but fails to prevent errors during the implementation. To overcome this problem, we propose feature-context interfaces, which provide a modular and non-variable programming interface to the variable source code of a product line. These interfaces ease changes, extensions, and the maintainability of product lines. To demonstrate applicability, we implemented a content assist and an outline view in Eclipse based on feature-context interfaces. We evaluate the potential of our method by analyzing the number of potential type errors we prevent compared to state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {We present in this paper an experience in modeling a family of parking brake systems, with shared assets and alternative solutions, and relate them to the needs of Renault in terms of variability management. The models are realized using a set of customized tools for model based systems engineering and variability management, based on SysML models. The purpose is to present an industrial context that requires the adoption of a product line approach and of variability modeling techniques, outside of a pure-software domain. At Renault, the interest is in identifying variations and reuse opportunities early in the product development cycle, as well as in preparing vehicle configuration specifications during the systems engineering process. This would lead to lowering the engineering effort and to higher quality and confidence in carry-over and carry across based solutions. We advocate for a tight integration of variability management with the model based systems engineering approach, which needs to address methodological support, modeling techniques and efficient tools for interactive configuration, adapted for engineering activities.},

abstract = {Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted HighlightsWe propose to combine IBEA and DE for the optimal feature selection in SPLE.We propose a feedback-directed method into EAs to improve the correctness of results.Our IBED with the seeding method has significantly shortened the search time.In most cases, IBED finds more unique and non-dominated solutions than IBEA. Software configuration, which aims to customize the software for different users (e.g., Linux kernel configuration), is an important and complicated task. In software product line engineering (SPLE), feature oriented domain analysis is adopted and feature model is used to guide the configuration of new product variants. In SPLE, product configuration is an optimal feature selection problem, which needs to find a set of features that have no conflicts and meanwhile achieve multiple design objectives (e.g., minimizing cost and maximizing the number of features). In previous studies, several multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) were used for the optimal feature selection problem and indicator-based evolutionary algorithm (IBEA) was proven to be the best MOEA for this problem. However, IBEA still suffers from the issues of correctness and diversity of found solutions. In this paper, we propose a dual-population evolutionary algorithm, named IBED, to achieve both correctness and diversity of solutions. In IBED, two populations are individually evolved with two different types of evolutionary operators, i.e., IBEA operators and differential evolution (DE) operators. Furthermore, we propose two enhancement techniques for existing MOEAs, namely the feedback-directed mechanism to fast find the correct solutions (e.g., solutions that satisfy the feature model constraints) and the preprocessing method to reduce the search space. Our empirical results have shown that IBED with the enhancement techniques can outperform several state-of-the-art MOEAs on most case studies in terms of correctness and diversity of found solutions.},

abstract = {Feature models are often used to describe variability and commonality in Software Product Lines, specifying admissible configurations of valid products. However, invalid configurations may arise in some scenarios. These include feature model evolution that invalidates pre-existing products or collaborative configuration by multiple stakeholders with conflicting goals, among others. This problem has been acknowledged in the literature and some techniques for configuration repair have already been proposed. However, common optimization criteria such as proximity between original and repaired configurations can result in a significant number of alternative repair possibilities, easily attaining thousands of alternatives for models of practical dimension. Consequently, rather than just efficiently providing an exhaustive list of possibilities, an approach that specifically addresses this issue should be able to offer the user a manageable and comprehensible view of the configuration problems and potential repair options. We offer a novel approach for configuration repair, based on partitioning and cover analysis, with high performance and generating high quality solutions, which allows efficient identification and presentation of multiple competing repairs.},

abstract = {Software Products Lines (SPLs) are families of products sharing common assets representing code or functionalities of a software product. These assets are represented as features, usually organized into Feature Models (FMs) from which the user can configure software products. Generally, few features are sufficient to allow configuring millions of software products. As a result, selecting the products matching given testing objectives is a difficult problem.The testing process usually involves multiple and potentially conflicting testing objectives to fulfill, e.g. maximizing the number of optional features to test while at the same time both minimizing the number of products and minimizing the cost of testing them. However, most approaches for generating products usually target a single objective, like testing the maximum amount of feature interactions. While focusing on one objective may be sufficient in certain cases, this practice does not reflect real-life testing situations.The present paper proposes a genetic algorithm to handle multiple conflicting objectives in test generation for SPLs. Experiments conducted on FMs of different sizes demonstrate the effectiveness, feasibility and practicality of the introduced approach.},

abstract = {Changing markets and environments has made the ability to rapidly adapt to these changes a necessity in software systems. However the costs of changing and adapting systems to new requirements still remains an unsolved issue. In this context service-oriented software product lines were introduced with the aim to combine the reusability of software product line with the flexibility of service-oriented architecture. Although this approach helps build flexible software systems with high levels of reuse, certain issues are raised. The main issue is the complexity that a service-oriented product line will face. Developing systems from internal and external assets, taking into consideration the variety and number of these assets, can cause problems in deciding which asset is best suited for the system. To help solve these issues we propose the use of approaches based on artificial intelligence. In this paper we show how swarm intelligence can be used in service-oriented product lines to reduce complexity and find optimal solutions for the development of software systems. We also present an example of the application of swarm intelligence in finding the optimal product for a service-oriented product line.},

Algebraic formalisms have been proposed by various authors to describe feature compositions and their interactions. The intention of feature compositions is the composition of fragments of documents of any kind to a product that fulfills users' requirements expressed by a feature selection. These modules often include code modules of typed programming languages whereas the proposed algebraic formalism is agnostic to types. This situation can lead to product code which is not type correct. In addition, types can carry semantic information on a program or module. We present a type system and connect it to an algebraic formalism thereby allowing automatic synthesis of feature compositions yielding well-typed programs.},

To guarantee quick access to reusable code artifacts (e.g. requirements, features or software components), the presented solution stores these artifacts together with related requirements and a generated variability model in an asset repository. The tool-supported approach has been applied to customizations of Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP systems.

abstract = {We present an approach to model-driven software product line engineering which is based on feature models and domain models. A feature model describes both common and varying properties of the instances of a software product line. The domain model is composed of a structural model (package and class diagrams) and a behavioral model (story diagrams). Features are mapped onto the domain model by annotating elements of the domain model with features. An element of a domain model is specific to the features included in its feature annotation. An instance of the product line is defined by a set of selected features (a feature configuration). A configuration of the domain model is built by excluding all elements whose feature set is not included in the feature configuration. To ensure consistency of the configured domain model, we define constraints on the annotations of inter-dependent domain model elements. These constraints guarantee that a model element may be selected only when the model elements are also included on which it depends. Violations of dependency constraints may be removed automatically with the help of an error repair tool which propagates features to dependent model elements.},

abstract = {Energy is a critical resource, and designing a sustainable software architecture is a non-trivial task. Developers require energy metrics that support sustainable software architectures reflecting quality attributes such as security, reliability, performance, etc., identifying what are the concerns that impact more in the energy consumption. A variability model of different designs and implementations of an energy model should exist for this task, as well as a service that stores and compares the experimentation results of energy and time consumption of each concern, finding out what is the most eco-efficient solution. The experimental measurements are performed by energy experts and researchers that share the energy model and metrics in a collaborative repository. HADAS confronts these tasks modelling and reasoning with the variability of energy consuming concerns for different energy contexts, connecting HADAS variability model with its energy efficiency collaborative repository, establishing a Software Product Line (SPL) service. Our main goal is to help developers to perform sustainability analyses finding out the eco-friendliest architecture configurations. A HADAS toolkit prototype is implemented based on a Clafer model and Choco solver, and it has been tested with several case studies.},

abstract = {Mature development methodologies like software product line engineering or model-driven engineering are more and more adopted in software development. Accordingly, the resulting development processes combine artifacts from different disciplines and on different abstraction levels. It is crucial that the relationship between these artifacts is explicitly maintained to be able to track the development process and the reasons for design decisions. This problem becomes exacerbated if variability is considered since it is a cross-cutting concern that impacts all disciplines and artifacts. Traceability links support the linking of artifacts across model boundaries in an end-to-end manner. However, existing traceability solutions are either limited to specific development processes, tools, and artifact types, lack in uniformity, or do not consider variability. Thus, this paper introduces a MOF-based generic traceability metamodel for establishing uniform traceability-enabled workflows in a variability-aware and model-based environment. Necessary steps for instantiating the metamodel to specific artifact types of certain development processes are described. We evaluate the proposed solution with an exemplar of a car headlight and demonstrate the benefits of a consistent traceability concept.},

abstract = {Product lines are usually built for the long term in order to repay the initial investment. While long-term stable software systems are already hard, if they are developed individually, it is even harder for complete product lines. At the time a new product line is created, the details of future product line characteristics are typically not known, no matter how well and detailed scoping and planning is done. Thus, any product line needs to evolve and adapt over time to incorporate new customer requirements as well as new technology constraints.Stability of the product line architecture is very important to the successful long-term evolution of a product line. In this paper, we discuss how a form of domain decomposition, which we call conceptual architecture, can be used to guide product line engineering towards long-term viability. We will illustrate this approach in the context of a large-scale product line development and analyze the evolution properties of the product line. Transferability of the approach is suggested to other embedded software systems that drive mature, well-understood physical control system.},

abstract = {Variable Data Printing solutions provide means to generate documents whose content varies according to some criteria. Since the early Mail Merge-like applications that generated letters with destination data taken from databases, different languages and frameworks have been developed with increasing levels of sophistication. Current tools allow the generation of highly customized documents that are variable not only in content, but also in layout. However, most frameworks are technology-oriented, and their use requires high skills in implementation-related tools (XML, XPATH, and others), which do not include support for domain-related tasks like identification of document content variability.In this paper, we introduce DPLfw, a framework for variable content document generation based on Software Product Line Engineering principles. It is an implementation of the Document Product Lines (DPL) approach, which was defined with the aim of supporting variable content document generation from a domain-oriented point of view. DPL models document content variability in terms of features, and product line-like processes support the generation of documents. We define the DPLfw architecture, and illustrate its use in the definition of variable-content emergency plans.},

However, some studies point to the viability of using this approach to develop Assistive Technology software. Through this approach, important limiting factors to use Assistive Technologies can be overcome. These factors are related to the acquisition costs and difficulty to find products corresponding to specific and varying user needs. Considering that Software Product Line approach provides mass customization of software products, the specific needs of each user can be more easily satisfied by software developers. Furthermore, the reuse of code artifacts to development provides a fall in the acquisition cost of these software products. We present in this paper a literature review that aims to investigate how this approach has been applied to the development of Assistive Technology software. Also, we present some quality factors that should be considered to develop Assistive Technologies using Software Product Lines. Thus, the main findings of the review are grouped in order to find the main gaps to be explored in future work.},

abstract = {Industrial variability models tend to grow in size and complexity due to ever-increasing functionality and complexity of software systems. Some authors report on variability models specifying several thousands of variabilities. However, traditional variability modeling approaches do not seem to scale adequately to cope with size and complexity of such models. Recently, textual variability modeling languages have been advocated as one scalable solution.In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of the capabilities of current textual variability modeling languages, in particular regarding variability management in the large. Towards this aim, we define a classification schema consisting of five dimensions, classify ten different textual variability modeling languages using the classification schema and provide an analysis. In summary, some textual variability modeling languages go beyond textual representations of traditional variability modeling approaches and provide sophisticated modeling concepts and constraint languages. Three textual variability modeling approaches already support mechanisms for large-scale variability modeling such as model composition, modularization, or evolution support.},

abstract = {In current software systems with highly volatile requirements, traceability plays a key role to maintain the consistency between requirements and code. Traceability between artifacts involved in the development of software product line (SPL) is still more critical because it is necessary to guarantee that the selection of variants that realize the different SPL products meet the requirements. Current SPL traceability mechanisms trace from variability in features to variations in the configuration of product-line architecture (PLA) in terms of adding and removing components. However, it is not always possible to materialize the variable features of a SPL through adding or removing components, since sometimes they are materialized inside components, i.e., in part of their functionality: a class, a service, and/or an interface. Additionally, variations that happen inside components may crosscut several components of architecture. These kinds of variations are still challenging and their traceability is not currently well supported. Therefore, it is not possible to guarantee that those SPL products with these kinds of variations meet the requirements. This paper presents a solution for tracing variability from features to PLA by taking these kinds of variations into account. This solution is based on models and traceability between models in order to automate SPL configuration by selecting the variants and realizing the product application. The FPLA modeling framework supports this solution which has been deployed in a software factory. Validation has consisted in putting the solution into practice to develop a product line of power metering management applications for smart grids.},

abstract = {High demands regarding the variability of automation software motivate organizations to automate the configuration process. In practice, this often leads to the development of custom configuration tools designed specifically for configuring the automation software they were developed for. This approach works well as long as both, the development of the software and the configurator are under the full control of the organization. However, software platforms are increasingly open, i.e., key customers add capabilities and thereby change the platform's variability. Often, these customers create a new platform themselves, which they offer to their customers. Moving from a closed platform to a software ecosystem means that development and variability management happen at multiple layers involving multiple teams with different backgrounds. This poses new requirements regarding the flexibility of configuration tools. In this paper, we report experiences and issues with a custom-developed configurator currently in use in an industrial automation software ecosystem. We describe how a model-based tool can be applied to address these issues and provide a scenario-based comparison of the custom-developed solution and the model-based configurator.},

abstract = {Variability management aims at taming variability in large and complex software product lines. To efficiently manage variability, it has to be modeled using formal representations, such as feature or decision models. Such models are efficient in many domains, where variability is about switching on and off features, or using parameters to customize products of the product line. However, variability can be represented in the form of a topology in domains where variability is about connecting components in a certain order, in specific interconnected hierarchies, or in different quantities.In this experience report, we explore topological variability within a case study of large-scale fire alarm systems. We identify core characteristics of the variability, derive modeling requirements, model the variability using UML2 class diagrams, and discuss the applicability of further variability modeling languages. We show that, although challenging, class diagrams can suffice to represent topological variability in order to generate a configurator tool. In contrast, modeling parallel and recursive structures, cycles, informal constraints, and orthogonal hierarchies were among the main experienced challenges that require further research.},

abstract = {Over the past decade language development tools have been significantly improved. This permitted both practitioners and researchers to design a wide variety of domain-specific languages (DSL) and extensions to programming languages. Moreover, multiple researchers have combined different language variants to form families of DSLs as well as programming languages. Unfortunately, current language development tools cannot directly support the development of these families. To overcome this limitation, researchers have recently applied ideas from software product lines (SPL) to create product lines of compilers/interpreters for language families, denoted language product lines (LPL). Similar to SPLs, however, these product lines can be created either using a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Yet, there exist no case study comparing the suitability of both approaches to the development of LPLs, making it unclear how language development tools should evolve. Accordingly, this paper compares both feature modeling approaches by applying them to the development of an LPL for the family of role-based programming languages and discussing their applicability, feasibility and overall suitability for the development of LPLs. Although one might argue that this compares apples and oranges, we believe that this case still provides crucial insights into the requirements, assumptions, and challenges of each approach.},

abstract = {The testing of scientific frameworks is a challenging task. The special characteristics of scientific software e.g. missing test oracle, the need for high performance parallel computing, and high priority of non-functional requirements, need to be accounted for as well as the large variability in a framework. In our previous research, we have shown how software product line engineering can be applied to support the testing of scientific frameworks. We developed a process for handling the variability of a framework using software product line (SPL) variability modeling. From the variability models, we derive test applications and use them for system tests for the framework. In this paper we examine the overall quality assurance for a scientific framework. First, we propose a SPL test strategy for scientific frameworks called Variable test Application strategy for Frameworks (VAF). This test strategy tests both, commonality and variability, of the framework and supports the framework's users in testing their applications by creating reusable test artifacts. We operationalize VAF with test activities that are combined with other quality assurance activities to form the design of a quality assurance process for scientific frameworks. We introduce a list of special characteristics for scientific software that we use as rationale for the design of this process.},

Various works have addressed edits to fms for fm evolution and tool support to ensure consistency of fms. An important extension to fms are feature cardinalities and related constraints, as extensively used e.g., when modeling variability of cloud computing environments. Since cardinality-based fms pose additional complexity, additional support for evolution and consistency checking with respect to feature cardinalities would be desirable, but has not been addressed yet. In this paper, we discuss common cardinality-based fm edits and resulting inconsistencies based on experiences with fms in cloud domain. We introduce tool-support for automated inconsistency detection and explanation based on an off-the-shelf solver. We demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by an empirical evaluation showing the performance of the tool.},

abstract = {Component-based software product line (SPL) consists of a set of software products that share common components. For a proper SPL product composition, each component has to follow three principles: encapsulating a single feature, restricting data access, and be replaceable. However, it is known that developers usually introduce anomalous structures, i.e., code smells, along the implementation of components. These code smells might violate one or more component principles and hinder the SPL product composition. Thus, developers should identify code smells in component-based SPLs, especially those affecting highly interconnected components, which are called critical components. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence of how smelly these critical components tend to be in component-based SPLs. To address this limitation, this paper presents a survey with developers of three SPLs. We inquire these developers about their perceptions of a critical component. Then, we characterize critical components per SPL, and identify nine recurring types of code smells. Finally, we quantitatively assess the smelliness of the critical components. Our results suggest that: (i) critical components are ten times more prone to have code smells than non-critical ones; (ii) the most frequent code smell types affecting critical components violate several component principles together; and (iii) these smell types affect multiple SPL components.},

Nevertheless, when compared with previously engineered derivative developments, when the second product of the product line was released, it was clear that the project had achieved significant improvements in quality, as well as reductions in development costs and time requirements. Automatic code generation also contributed to those improvements.},

Componentized language frameworks, coupled with variability modeling, have the potential to bring language development to the masses, by simplifying the configuration of a new language from an existing set of reusable components. However, designing variability models for this purpose requires not only a good understanding of these frameworks and the way components interact, but also an adequate familiarity with the problem domain.In this paper we propose an approach to automatically infer a relevant variability model from a collection of already implemented language components, given a structured, but general representation of the domain. We describe techniques to assist users in achieving a better understanding of the relationships between language components, and find out which languages can be derived from them with respect to the given domain.},

abstract = {In emerging domains such as Cloud-based Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) and SCADA systems where data-intensive and high performance computing are needed, a higher degree of flexibility is being demanded to meet new stakeholder requirements, context changes and intrinsic complexity. In this light, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) provide a way to build self-managing systems exploiting traditional product line engineering concepts at runtime. Although context-awareness is widely perceived to be a first-class concern in such runtime variability mechanisms, existing approaches do not provide the necessary level of formalization to model and enact context variability for DSPLs. This is crucial for operational analytics processes since variant configuration could differ from context to context depending on diverse data values linked to context features and cross-tree constraints in a feature model. In this paper, we propose a context variability modeling approach, demonstrate its applicability and usability via a wind farm use case, and present the fundamental building blocks of a framework for enabling context variability in service-based DSPLs which provide Workflow as a Service (WFaaS).},

Accordingly, business partners customize the standard business document types for fitting their needs and requirements, resulting in different business document type variants. However, the approach is missing sufficient mechanisms for managing business document model variants. First, customizing standardized business document types is purely based on a textual specification. Second, the variability present within the Core Component approach lacks an explicit representation. In this paper, we aim at making variability explicit as well as adding a formal aspect to the business document type customization process by employing variability concepts from Product Line Engineering. Furthermore, based on having explicit variability models, business partners are provided with an approach for customizing business document types through configuring variability models.},

In this paper we introduce a tool suite which automatically processes natural-language requirements documents into a candidate feature model, which can be refined by the requirements engineer. The framework also guides the process of identifying variant concerns and their composition with other features. We also provide language support for specifying semantic variant feature compositions which are resilient to change. We show that feature models produced by this framework compare favourably with those produced by domain experts by application to a real-life industrial example.},

In this paper, we list best practices for the migration process and how to come to a sustainable solution without cannibalizing the existing platform and products.In particular, we describe our way of identification beneficial sub-domains using C/V analysis and give an example scenario with alignments in order to increase commonality. We explain the maturity considerations for deciding on reuse of existing implementations and a carve-out strategy to split existing assets into common modules and product-line specific extensions. Furthermore, we describe our best practices for making the scope extension sustainable in a long term, using various types of governance means. We briefly complement these experiences with further insights gained during execution of this endeavor.},

Both approaches share several common goals, which provide the motivation for integrating them. However, there has been little empirical research for understanding how these approaches can be integrated in industrial settings. This paper presents the findings from a case study of a software development company that has successfully integrated software product line architecture and agile software development practices. The company's processes are described based on product line and agile practices. The results are expected to provide useful insights into the mechanics of exploiting product line practices in agile software development despite apparent philosophical clashes between the two approaches.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (LPS) is a paradigm that reuses software artifacts throughout a set of systems that have common and variable characteristics. To guarantee the quality of an SPL and, consequently, of its generated products, it is necessary to use verification and validation activities, such as software inspections. Thus, it is possible to detect defects in different artifacts from the earliest stages in a software development cycle. To support this activity there is a number of techniques, such as SMartyCheck, defined as a checklist-based reading technique, which allows inspection of SMarty UML diagrams. It is important to note that the SMartyCheck technique was previously evaluated in two empirical studies (one qualitative and one quantitative) taking into consideration UML use case diagrams and class diagrams. Both studies pointed out significant results in favor of SMartyCheck. SMartyCheck evolved encompassing UML component diagrams. In this sense, this paper presents initial evidence of the evaluation of SMartyCheck applied for defect detection in UML component diagram based on a controlled experiment carried out in the academy. SMartyCheck was compared to Ad Hoc inspection technique and had superior results for effectiveness and efficiency. Accuracy provided no significant difference between both techniques.},

abstract = {In the software product line research, product variants typically differ by their functionality and quality attributes are not purposefully varied. The goal is to study purposeful performance variability in software product lines, in particular, the motivation to vary performance, and the strategy for realizing performance variability in the product line architecture. The research method was a theory-building case study that was augmented with a systematic literature review. The case was a mobile network base station product line with capacity variability. The data collection, analysis and theorizing were conducted in several stages: the initial case study results were augmented with accounts from the literature. We constructed three theoretical models to explain and characterize performance variability in software product lines: the models aim to be generalizable beyond the single case. The results describe capacity variability in a base station product line. Thereafter, theoretical models of performance variability in software product lines in general are proposed. Performance variability is motivated by customer needs and characteristics, by trade-offs and by varying operating environment constraints. Performance variability can be realized by hardware or software means; moreover, the software can either realize performance differences in an emergent way through impacts from other variability or by utilizing purposeful varying design tactics. The results point out two differences compared with the prevailing literature. Firstly, when the customer needs and characteristics enable price differentiation, performance may be varied even with no trade-offs or production cost differences involved. Secondly, due to the dominance of feature modeling, the literature focuses on the impact management realization. However, performance variability can be realized through purposeful design tactics to downgrade the available software resources and by having more efficient hardware.},

Determining and negotiating the scope in a product line that spans several business units with their own economic goals is challenging. Feature modeling offers a good way to do variability/commonality analysis for complex product lines. A precondition for feature modeling is the identification of all features supporting the product line. To identify these features, we developed a method for systematically deriving a feature model top down based on domain know-how. We call this method domain specific feature modeling. As the primary artifact to describe the problem space, a domain specific feature model additionally improves the requirement understanding for all stakeholders by considerably improving the scoping, traceability, testing, efficiency and transparency of planning activities and making the development efforts easier to estimate. In this paper, we share our experience with domain specific feature modeling in a large platform project and describe the lessons learned. We describe our general approach that can also be used for other domains.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve the multi-stakeholder configuration process, considering stakeholders' preferences expressed through both hard and soft constraints. Based on such preferences, we recommend different product configurations using different strategies from the social choice theory. We conducted an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of our strategies with respect to individual stakeholder satisfaction and fairness among all stakeholders. Results indicate that particular strategies perform best with respect to these aspects.},

abstract = {The Product Line Architecture (PLA) is one of the most important artifacts of a Software Product Line. PLA designing has been formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem and successfully solved by a state-of-the-art search-based approach. However, the majority of empirical studies optimize PLA designs without applying one of the fundamental genetic operators: the crossover. An operator for PLA design, named Feature-driven Crossover, was proposed in a previous study. In spite of the promising results, this operator occasionally generated incomplete solutions. To overcome these limitations, this paper aims to enhance the search-based PLA design optimization by improving the Feature-driven Crossover and introducing a novel crossover operator specific for PLA design. The proposed operators were evaluated in two well-studied PLA designs, using three experimental configurations of NSGA-II in comparison with a baseline that uses only mutation operators. Empirical results show the usefulness and efficiency of the presented operators on reaching consistent solutions. We also observed that the two operators complement each other, leading to PLA design solutions with better feature modularization than the baseline experiment.},

abstract = {The verification of software product lines is an active research area. A challenge is to efficiently verify similar products without the need to generate and verify them individually. As solution, researchers suggest family-based verification approaches, which either transform compile-time into runtime variability or make verification tools variability-aware. Existing approaches either focus on theorem proving, model checking, or other verification techniques. For the first time, we combine theorem proving and model checking to evaluate their synergies for product-line verification. We provide tool support by connecting five existing tools, namely FeatureIDE and FeatureHouse for product-line development, as well as KeY, JPF, and OpenJML for verification of Java programs. In an experiment, we found the synergy of improved effectiveness and efficiency, especially for product lines with few defects. Further, we experienced that model checking and theorem proving are more efficient and effective if the product line contains more defects.},

A total of 39 research papers have been reviewed from an initial set of 1388 papers. The results show that 25% of the papers reported evaluations at the Design phase of the Domain Engineering phase. The most widely used mechanism for modeling quality attributes was extended feature models and the most evaluated artifact was the base architecture. In addition, the results of the review have identified several research gaps. Specifically, 77% of the papers employed case studies as a "proof of concept" whereas 23% of the papers did not perform any type of validation.

abstract = {Building a software product line (SPL) is a systematic strategy for reusing software within a family of related systems from some application domain. To define an SPL, domain analysts must identify the common and variable aspects of systems in the family and capture this information so that it can be used effectively to construct specific products. Often analysts record this information using a feature model expressed visually as a feature diagram. The overall goal of this project is to enable wider use of SPLs by identifying relevant concepts, defining systematic methods, and developing practical tools that leverage familiar web programming technologies. This paper presents a novel approach to specification of feature models: capture the details using automatically generated user interfaces, encode the models in a relational database, and then validate the models and construct specific products using SQL.},

abstract = {In a software product line, security may need to be varied. Consequently, security variability must be managed both from the customer and product line architecture point of view. We utilize design science to build an artifact and a generalized design theory for representing and configuring security and functional variability from the requirements to the architecture in a configurable software product line. An open source web shop product line, Magento, is used as a case example to instantiate and evaluate the contribution. The results indicate that security variability can be represented and distinguished as countermeasures; and that a configurator tool is able to find consistent products as stable models of answer set programs.},

abstract = {Feature modeling is a process for identifying the common and variable parts of a software product line and recording them in a tree-structured feature model. However, feature models can be difficult for mainstream developers to specify and maintain because most tools rely on specialized theories, notations, or technologies. To address this issue, we propose a design that uses mainstream JSON-related technologies to encode and manipulate feature models and then uses the models to generate Web forms for product configuration. This JSON-based design can form part of a comprehensive, interactive environment that enables mainstream developers to specify, store, update, and exchange feature models and use them to configure members of product families.},

abstract = {A program family might degenerate due to unplanned changes in its implementation, thus hindering the maintenance of family members. This degeneration is often induced by feature code that is changed individually in each member without considering other family members. Hence, as a program family evolves over time, it might no longer be possible to distinguish between common and variable features. One of the imminent activities to address this problem is the history-sensitive recovery of program family's features in the code. This recovery process encompasses the analysis of the evolution history of each family member in order to classify the implementation elements according to their variability nature. In this context, this paper proposes history-sensitive heuristics for the recovery of features in code of degenerate program families. Once the analysis of the family history is carried out, the feature elements are structured as Java project packages; they are intended to separate those elements in terms of their variability degree. The proposed heuristics are supported by a prototype tool called RecFeat. We evaluated the accuracy of the heuristics in the context of 33 versions of 2 industry program families. They presented encouraging results regarding recall measures that ranged from 85% to 100%; whereas the precision measures ranged from 71% to 99%.},

For software product lines, modifying variability is an additional challenge that must be carefully tackled during the evolution of the product line. This bears considerable challenges for industry as understanding on how variability realizations advance over time is not trivial. Moreover, it may lead to an erosion of variability, which needs an investigation of techniques on how to identify the variability erosion in practice, especially in the source code. To address various erosion symptoms, we have investigated the evolution of a large-scale industrial product line over a period of four years. Along improvement goals, we have researched a set of appropriate metrics and measurement approaches in a goal-oriented way, applied them in this case study with tool support, and interpreted the results including identified erosion symptoms.},

Hence, the PLA design is an optimization problem and problems like that have been successfully solved in the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) area, by using metaheuristics such as Genetic Algorithm. Considering this fact, this paper introduces a tool named OPLA-Tool, conceived to provide computer support to a search-based approach for PLA design. OPLA-Tool implements all the steps necessary to use multi-objective optimization algorithms, including PLA transformations and visualization through a graphical interface. OPLA-Tool receives as input a PLA at the class diagram level, and produces a set of good alternative diagrams in terms of cohesion, feature modularization and reduction of crosscutting concerns.},

No phase was spared: several conceptual formalisms e.g. ER, UML, ontological, various logical models e.g. relational, object, key-value, a wide panoply of physical optimization structures and deployment platforms have been proposed. As a result, the database design process has become more complex involving more tasks and even more actors as database architect or analyst. Getting inspired from software engineering in dealing with variable similar systems, we propose a methodological framework for a variability-aware design of databases, whereby this latter is henceforth devised as a Software Product Line. Doing so guarantees a high reuse, automation, and customizability in generating ready-to-be implemented databases. We also propose a solution to help users make a suitable choice among the wide panoply. Finally, a case study is presented.},

abstract = {Software ecosystems is an emerging trend within the software industry, implying a shift from closed organizations and processes towards open structures, where actors external to the software development organization are becoming increasingly involved in development. This forms an ecosystem of organizations that are related through the shared interest in a software product, leading to new opportunities and new challenges to the industry and its organizational environment. To understand why and how this change occurs, we have followed the development of a software product line organization for a period of approximately five years. We have studied their change from a waterfall-like approach, via agile software product line engineering, towards an emerging software ecosystem. We discuss implications for practice, and propose a nascent theory on software ecosystems. We conclude that the observed change has led to an increase in collaboration across (previously closed) organizational borders, and to the development of a shared value consisting of two components: the technology (the product line, as an extensible platform), and the business domain it supports. Opening up both the technical interface of the product and the organizational interfaces are key enablers of such a change.},

abstract = {Software product lines have potential to allow for mass customization of products. Unfortunately, the resulting, vast amount of possible product variants with commonalities and differences leads to new challenges in software testing. Ideally, every product variant should be tested, especially in safety-critical systems. However, due to the exponentially increasing number of product variants, testing every product variant is not feasible. Thus, new concepts and techniques are required to provide efficient SPL testing strategies exploiting the commonalities of software artifacts between product variants to reduce redundancy in testing. In this paper, we present an efficient integration testing approach for SPLs based on delta modeling. We focus on test case prioritization. As a result, only the most important test cases for every product variant are tested, reducing the number of executed test cases significantly, as testing can stop at any given point because of resource constraints while ensuring that the most important test cases have been covered. We present the general concept and our evaluation results. The results show a measurable reduction of executed test cases compared to single-software testing approaches.},

abstract = {A Software Product Line (SPL) is a set of products built from a number of features, the set of valid products being defined by a feature model. Typically, it does not make sense to test all products defined by an SPL and one instead chooses a set of products to test (test selection) and, ideally, derives a good order in which to test them (test prioritisation). Since one cannot know in advance which products will reveal faults, test selection and prioritisation are normally based on objective functions that are known to relate to likely effectiveness or cost. This article introduces a new technique, the grid-based evolution strategy (GrES), which considers several objective functions that assess a selection or prioritisation and aims to optimise on all of these. The problem is thus a many-objective optimisation problem. We use a new approach, in which all of the objective functions are considered but one (pairwise coverage) is seen as the most important. We also derive a novel evolution strategy based on domain knowledge. The results of the evaluation, on randomly generated and realistic feature models, were promising, with GrES outperforming previously proposed techniques and a range of many-objective optimisation algorithms.},

abstract = {Model checking provides a convenient way to check whether a given software system is correct with respect to a set of relevant semantic properties. To use a model checker like SPIN [5], the software system must be modelled as a transition system (TS). Afterwards, the model checker can check the correctness of the translated TS by exhaustively exploring all possible transitions.For families of software systems Classen et al. [1] present a lifted model checker SNIP, where each family is modelled as a Featured TS [2] that has transitions guarded by feature expressions. SNIP is highly specialized and uses heuristics to avoid na\"{\i}vely iterating through all possible variations; however, the number of configurations is still exponential in size and thus the model checker can only feasibly handle systems of a limited size.We adapt our previous work on applying variability abstraction to lifted data-flow analysis [3] to the setting of lifted model checking. We present a calculus of variability abstractions that trade precision for speed while preserving correctness [4]. The abstractions work symbiotically with the lifted model checker SNIP, but can also work with the classical and efficient off-the-shelf model checker SPIN without requiring any knowledge of variability. We prove semantically how each abstraction operation in the calculus forms a Galois collection, and therefore is suitable to use in abstract interpretation of Featured TS. Furthermore, we present an equivalent lightweight syntactic transformation tool that works directly on the input text files and does not require explicitly constructing the corresponding Featured TS in memory.Our results show that there are orders of magnitudes to be gained in performance compared to performing lifted analysis alone; we show how our tool scales better than the existing tools and makes analysing some previously infeasible models feasible. Furthermore, we also show that many models could be verified swiftly using the abstracted analysis without requiring all of the precision that a concrete analysis provides.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines Engineering is the area of software engineering that aims to systematise the modelling, creation and improvement of groups of interconnected software systems by formally expressing possible alternative products in the form of Feature Models. Deriving a software product/system from a feature model is called Feature Configuration. Engineers select the subset of features (software components) from a feature model that suits their needs, while respecting the underlying relationships/constraints of the system–which is challenging on its own. Since there exist several (and often antagonistic) perspectives on which the quality of software could be assessed, the problem is even more challenging as it becomes a multi-objective optimisation problem. Current multi-objective feature selection in software product line approaches (e.g., SATIBEA) combine the scalability of a genetic algorithm (IBEA) with a solution reparation approach based on a SAT solver or one of its derivatives. In this paper, we propose MILPIBEA, a novel hybrid algorithm which combines IBEA with the accuracy of a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) reparation. We show that the MILP reparation modifies fewer features from the original infeasible solutions than the SAT reparation and in a shorter time. We also demonstrate that MILPIBEA outperforms SATIBEA on average on various multi-objective performance metrics, especially on the largest feature models. The other major challenge in software engineering in general and in software product lines, in particular, is evolution. While the change in software components is common in the software engineering industry, the particular case of multi-objective optimisation of evolving software product lines is not well-tackled yet. We show that MILPIBEA is not only able to better take advantage of the evolution than SATIBEA, but it is also the one that continues to improve the quality of the solutions when SATIBEA stagnates. Overall, IBEA performs better when combined with MILP instead of SAT reparation when optimising the multi-objective feature selection in large and evolving software product lines.},

abstract = {Product Line Engineering (PLE) is becoming a common practice in industry to enhance product quality, to reduce development costs, and to improve time-to-market. At the same time, many development contexts are use case-driven and this strongly influences their requirements engineering and system testing practices. In this PhD project, we aim to achieve automated and effective change management in a product family within the context of use case-driven development and system testing. To this end, we first provide a modeling method for capturing variability information explicitly in Product Line (PL) use case and domain models. Then, we propose an automated configuration approach to automatically generate Product Specific (PS) use case and domain models from PL models. In addition, we plan to provide a change impact analysis approach for PL use case and domain models and automated regression test selection for system test cases derived from PL use case models.},

abstract = {Agent-based business process simulation has grown in popularity, in part because of its analysis capabilities. The analyses depend on the kinds of simulations that can be built, adapted, and extended, which in turn depend on the underlying simulation framework. We report the results of our analysis of 19 agent-based process simulation tools and their simulation frameworks. We conclude that a growing number of simulation tools are using component-based software techniques. Nevertheless, most simulation tools do not directly support requirements models, their transformation into executable simulations, or the management of model variants over time. Such practices are becoming more widely applied in software engineering under the term software product line engineering (SPLE). Based on our analysis, agent-based process simulation tools may improve their customization capacity by: (1) supporting object modeling more completely and (2) supporting software product line engineering issues.},

abstract = {A feature model captures various possible configurations of products within a product family. When configuring a product, several features are selected and composed. Selecting features at the program level has a general limitation of not being able to relate the resulting configuration to its requirements. As a result, it is difficult to decide whether a given configuration of features is optimal. An optimal configuration satisfies all stakeholder requirements and quantitative constraints, while ensuring that there is no extraneous feature in it. In relating requirements and feature configurations, we use the description of the problem world context in which the software is designed to operate as the intermediate description between them. The advantage of our approach is that feature selection can be done at the requirements level, and an optimal program level configuration can be generated from the requirements selected. Our approach is illustrated with a real-life problem of configuring a satellite communication software. The use of an existing tool to support our approach is also discussed.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering is a best practice for managing reuse in families of software systems that is increasingly being applied to novel and emerging domains. In this work we investigate the use of software product line engineering in one of these new domains, synthetic biology. In synthetic biology living organisms are programmed to perform new functions or improve existing functions. These programs are designed and constructed using small building blocks made out of DNA. We conjecture that there are families of products that consist of common and variable DNA parts, and we can leverage product line engineering to help synthetic biologists build, evolve, and reuse DNA parts. In this paper we perform an investigation of domain engineering that leverages an open-source repository of more than 45,000 reusable DNA parts. We show the feasibility of these new types of product line models by identifying features and related artifacts in up to 93.5% of products, and that there is indeed both commonality and variability. We then construct feature models for four commonly engineered functions leading to product lines ranging from 10 to 7.5 \texttimes{} 1020 products. In a case study we demonstrate how we can use the feature models to help guide new experimentation in aspects of application engineering. Finally, in an empirical study we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of automated reverse engineering on both complete and incomplete sets of products. In the process of these studies, we highlight key challenges and uncovered limitations of existing SPL techniques and tools which provide a roadmap for making SPL engineering applicable to new and emerging domains.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a rising interest in cloud computing, which is often used to offer Software as a Service (SaaS) over the Internet. SaaS applications can be offered to clients at a lower cost as they are usually multi-tenant: many end users make use of a single application instance, even when they are from different organisations. It is difficult to offer highly customizable SaaS applications that are still multi-tenant, which is why these SaaS applications are often offered in a one size fits all approach.In some application domains applications must be highly customizable, making it more difficult to migrate them to a cloud environment, and losing the benefits of multi-tenancy. In this paper we compare multiple approaches for the development and management of highly customizable multitenant SaaS applications, and present a methodology for developing and managing these applications. We compare two approaches, an application-based approach focusing on deploying multiple multi-tenant applications variants, and a feature-based approach where applications are composed out of multi-tenant services using a service oriented architecture. In addition, we also discuss a hybrid approach combining properties of both. We conclude that the feature-based approach results in the fewest application instances at runtime resulting in more multi-tenancy.},

abstract = {Abstract Delta Modeling (ADM) offers an algebraic description of how a (software) product line may be built so that every product can be automatically derived by structured reuse of code. In traditional application engineering a single valid feature configuration is chosen, which does not change during the lifetime of the product. However, there are many useful applications for product lines that change their configuration at run time. We present a new technique for generating efficient dynamic product lines from their static counterparts. We use Mealy machines for their dynamic reconfiguration. Furthermore, we posit that monitoring some features will be more expensive than monitoring others, and present techniques for minimizing the cost of monitoring the system. We stay in the abstract setting of ADM but the techniques can be instantiated to any concrete domain. We illustrate them through the example of a mobile application for Android, which dynamically reconfigures a devices operating profile based on environmental factors.},

abstract = {A novel method to optimize the scope of a software product platform is proposed.The method is supported with a mathematical formulation and an optimization solver.Depending on the input parameters and the objectives, competing scopes can exist.The method shows how trade-off analysis can be performed among competing scopes.The results of the method were validated as "satisfiable" to "very satisfiable". ContextDue to increased competition and the advent of mass customization, many software firms are utilizing product families - groups of related products derived from a product platform - to provide product variety in a cost-effective manner. The key to designing a successful software product family is the product platform, so it is important to determine the most appropriate product platform scope related to business objectives, for product line development. AimThis paper proposes a novel method to find the optimized scope of a software product platform based on end-user features. MethodThe proposed method, PPSMS (Product Platform Scoping Method for Software Product Lines), mathematically formulates the product platform scope selection as an optimization problem. The problem formulation targets identification of an optimized product platform scope that will maximize life cycle cost savings and the amount of commonality, while meeting the goals and needs of the envisioned customers' segments. A simulated annealing based algorithm that can solve problems heuristically is then used to help the decision maker in selecting a scope for the product platform, by performing tradeoff analysis of the commonality and cost savings objectives. ResultsIn a case study, PPSMS helped in identifying 5 non-dominated solutions considered to be of highest preference for decision making, taking into account both cost savings and commonality objectives. A quantitative and qualitative analysis indicated that human experts perceived value in adopting the method in practice, and that it was effective in identifying appropriate product platform scope.},

However, the user interface (UI) part of applications has barely been addressed yet. While standard SPL concepts allow derivation of functionally correct UIs, there are additional non-functional requirements, like usability, which have to be considered. This paper presents a case study investigating UI variability found in variants of the commercial web-based information system HIS-GX/QIS. We analyze which aspects of a UI vary and to which degree. The results show that just tweaking the final UI (e.g., using stylesheets) is not sufficient but there is a need for more customization which must be supported by, e.g., UI-specific models.},

abstract = {Feature models are a popular variability modeling notation used in product line engineering. Automated analyses of feature models, such as consistency checking and interactive or offline product selection, often rely on translating models to propositional logic and using satisfiability (SAT) solvers.Efficiency of individual satisfiability-based analyses has been reported previously. We generalize and quantify these studies with a series of independent experiments. We show that previously reported efficiency is not incidental. Unlike with the general SAT instances, which fall into easy and hard classes, the instances induced by feature modeling are easy throughout the spectrum of realistic models. In particular, the phenomenon of phase transition is not observed for realistic feature models.Our main practical conclusion is a general encouragement for researchers to continued development of SAT-based methods to further exploit this efficiency in future.},

abstract = {The increasing complexity and cost of software-intensive systems has led developers to seek ways of increasing software reusability. One software reuse approach is to develop a Software Product-line (SPL), which is a reconfigurable software architecture that can be reused across projects. Creating configurations of the SPL that meets arbitrary requirements is hard.Existing research has focused on techniques that produce a configuration of the SPL in a single step. This paper provides three contributions to the study of multi-step configuration for SPLs. First, we present a formal model of multi-step SPL configuration and map this model to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Second, we show how solutions to these CSP configuration problem CSPs can be derived automatically with a constraint solver. Third, we present empirical results demonstrating that our CSP-based technique can solve multi-step configuration problems involving hundreds of features in seconds.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) have evolved and gained attention as one of the most promising approaches for software reuse. Feature models are the main technique to represent domain variability in SPLs. However, there are other domain aspects, besides variability, which cannot be expressed in a feature model. Also, these diagrams were not designed to facilitate information retrieval, interoperability and inference. In contrast, ontologies seem to be the best solution to meet these requirements. Therefore, this work presents an approach for semantic enrichment of SPLs using ontologies. Our proposal provides methods to add domain information besides variability description, and a top-ontology that specifies generic concepts and relations in an SPL, working as a guide model for information addition. The proposed approach reuses the existing SPL feature model, adding semantic descriptions in a less intrusive way than modifying the feature model notation.},

We characterize the types of non-Boolean features in the models, kinds and quantities of non-Boolean constraints in use, and the impact of these characteristics on the hardness of this model from analysis perspective.

There is still a need, however, to generate test cases for individual products in product lines more efficiently. In this paper we propose an approach, CONTESA, for generating test cases for SPLs using test suite augmentation. Instead of generating test cases for products independently, our approach generates new test cases for products in an order that allows it to build on test cases created for products tested earlier. In this work, we use a genetic algorithm to generate test cases, targeting branches not yet covered in each product, although other algorithms and coverage criteria could be utilized. We have evaluated CONTESA on two non-trivial SPLs, and have shown that CONTESA is more efficient and effective than an approach that generates test cases for products independently. A further evaluation shows that CONTESA is more effective at achieving coverage, and reveals as many faults as an existing feature-based testing approach.},

We describe how we have designed and developed a variability modeling language, called VM, resulting from the close collaboration with industrial partners during 2 years. We expose the specific requirements and advanced variability constructs; we developed and used to characterize and derive variations of video sequences. The results of our experiments and industrial experience show that our solution is effective to model complex variability information and supports the synthesis of hundreds of realistic video variants. From the software language perspective, we learned that basic variability mechanisms are useful but not enough; attributes and multi-features are of prior importance; meta-information and specific constructs are relevant for scalable and purposeful reasoning over variability models. From the video domain and software perspective, we report on the practical benefits of a variability approach. With more automation and control, practitioners can now envision benchmarking video algorithms over large, diverse, controlled, yet realistic datasets (videos that mimic real recorded videos)--something impossible at the beginning of the project.},

We investigate different distances as well as as single-objective algorithms, (dissimilarity on actions, random, all-actions). Our results on four case studies show the relevance of dissimilarity-based test generation for behavioural SPL models, especially on the largest case-study where no other approach can match it.},

abstract = {Software architects typically spend a great deal of time and effort exploring uncertainties, evaluating alternatives, and balancing the concerns of stakeholders. Selecting the best architecture to meet both the functional and non-functional requirements is a critical but difficult task, especially at the early stage of software development when there may be many uncertainties. For example, how will a technology match the operational or performance expectations in reality? This paper presents an approach to building architecture-centric product line. The main objective of the proposed approach is to support effective requirements validation and architectural prototyping for the application-level software. Architectural prototyping is practically essential to architecture design and evaluation. However, architectural prototyping practiced in the field mostly is not used to explore alternatives. Effective construction and evaluation of multiple architecture alternatives is one of the critically challenging tasks. The product line architecture advocated in this paper consists of multiple software architecture alternatives, from which the architect can select and rapidly generate a working application prototype. The paper presents a case study of developing a framework that is primarily built with robust architecture patterns in distributed and concurrent computing and includes variation mechanisms to support various applications even in different domains. The development process of the framework is an application of software product line engineering with an aim to effectively facilitate upfront requirements analysis for an application and rapid architectural prototyping to explore and evaluate architecture alternatives.},

abstract = {Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) provide a promising approach for planning and applying runtime reconfiguration scenarios to adaptive software systems. However, applying DSPLs in the vital domain of highly context-aware systems, e.g., mobile devices, is obstructed by the inherently limited resources being insufficient to handle large, constrained (re-)configurations spaces. To tackle these drawbacks, we propose a novel model-based approach for designing DSPLs in a way that allows for a trade-off between precomputation of reconfiguration scenarios at development time and on-demand evolution at runtime. Therefore, we (1) enrich feature models with context information to reason about potential context changes, and (2) specify context-aware reconfiguration processes on the basis of a scalable transition system incorporating state space abstractions and incremental refinement at runtime. We illustrate our concepts by means of a smartphone case study and present an implementation and evaluation considering different trade-off metrics.},

abstract = {In many domains such as automotive and avionics, the size and complexity of software systems is quickly increasing. At the same time, many stakeholders tend to be involved in the development of such systems, which typically must also be configured for multiple customers with varying needs. Product Line Engineering (PLE) is therefore an inevitable practice for such systems. Furthermore, because in many areas requirements must be explicit and traceability to them is required by standards, use cases and domain models are common practice for requirements elicitation and analysis. In this paper, based on the above observations, we aim at supporting PLE in the context of use case-centric development. Therefore, we propose, apply, and assess a use case-driven configuration approach which interactively receives configuration decisions from the analysts to generate product-specific (PS) use case and domain models. Our approach provides the following: (1) a use case-centric product line modeling method (PUM), (2) automated, interactive configuration support based on PUM, and (3) an automatic generation of PS use case and domain models from Product Line (PL) models and configuration decisions. The approach is supported by a tool relying on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and integrated with an industrial requirements management tool, i.e., IBM DOORS. We successfully applied and evaluated our approach to an industrial case study in the automotive domain, thus showing evidence that the approach is practical and beneficial to capture variability at the appropriate level of granularity and to configure PS use case and domain models in industrial settings.},

abstract = {Managing dynamic variability has motivated several researchers to combine Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) practices with runtime variability mechanisms. By combining these approaches, a DSPL acquires important features, ranging from the ability to reconfigure by changing the context, adding or removing features, crash recovery, and re-adaptation based on changes in the model’s features. Feature model (FM) is an important artifact of a DPSL and there is a lack of tools that support the modeling of this artifact. We have extended the DyMMer tool for modeling FM of DSPLs from an adaptation mechanism based on MAPE-K to solve this problem. We migrated the DyMMer tool to a web version and incorporated new features: (i) modeling of FMs from SPLs and DSPLs, (ii) development of an adaptation mechanism for FM of DSPLs, (iii) repository of FMs, (iv) inclusion of thresholds for measures, and (v) user authentication. We believe that this tool is useful for research in the area of DSPLs, and also for dynamic domain modeling and evaluation. Video: https://youtu.be/WVHW6bI8ois},

abstract = {Mobile devices like smartphones are getting increasingly important in our daily lifes. They are used in various environments and have to dynamically adapt themselves accordingly in order to provide an optimal runtime behavior. Naturally, adapting to continuously changing environmental conditions is a challenging task because mobile devices are always limited in their resources and have to adapt in real-time. In this paper, we introduce an approach that enables resource limited devices to adapt to changing conditions using dynamic software product lines techniques. Therefore, feature models are reduced to a specific hardware context before installing the adaptive mobile application on the device. This reduces the amount of possible configurations that are compatible with the device and, thereby, minimizes the costs and the duration of an adaptation during runtime.},

abstract = {Successful software products evolve continuously to meet the changing stakeholder requirements. For software product lines, an additional challenge is that variabilities, characteristics that vary among products, change as well over time. That challenge must be carefully tackled during the evolution of the product line infrastructure. This is a significant problem for many software development organizations, as practical guidelines on how to evolve core assets, and especially source code, are missing.This paper investigates how to achieve "good enough" variability management during the evolution of variation in software design and implementation assets. As a first contribution, we present a customizable goal-based approach which helps to identify improvement potential in existing core assets to ease evolution. To find concrete ways to improve the product line infrastructure, we list the typical symptoms of variability "code smells" and show how to refine them to root causes, questions, and finally to metrics that can be extracted from large code bases.As a second main contribution, we show how this method was applied to evaluate the reuse quality of three industrial embedded systems. These systems are implemented in C or C++ and use Conditional Compilation as the main variability mechanism. We also introduce the analysis and refactoring tool set that was used in the case studies and discuss the lessons learnt.},

The graphical security models are based on attributed attack-defense diagrams to capture the structure and properties of vulnerabilities, defenses and countermeasures---with notable similarities to feature diagrams---and on probabilistic models of attack behavior, capable of capturing resource constraints and attack effectiveness. In this paper, we provide an overview of the framework that is described in full technical detail in twin papers, which present the formal syntax and semantics of the domain-specific language and showcase the associated tool with advanced IDE support for performing analyses based on statistical model checking. The properties of interest range from average cost and success probability of attacks to the effectiveness of defenses and countermeasures. Here we illustrate the capabilities of the DSL and the tool by applying them to an example scenario from the security domain. This shows how techniques from variability modeling can be applied to security. We conclude with a vision and roadmap for future research.},

abstract = {The problem known as Variability Test of Software Product Line (VTSPL) is related to the selection of the most representative products for the SPL testing. This is an optimization problem because a possible exponential number of products can be derived from the SPL variability model, such as the Feature Model (FM). In the literature many works are dedicated to this research subject, each one applying a different search-based algorithm and using distinct criteria. However, there is no study encompassing all these criteria at the same time. To this end, this paper investigates the use of two Many-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MaOEAs). We apply the algorithm NSGA-III, widely used for many-objective algorithms, and the algorithm PCA-NSGA-II, a reduction dimensionality algorithm, which uses the Principal-Component Analysis (PCA) in combination with NSGA-II, to evaluate the objectives used in the literature for the VTSPL problem. PCA-NSGA-II reduces the search space dimensionality by eliminating the redundant objectives. The analysis shows the importance of some objectives such as the number of alive mutants, similarity between products, and unselected features. NSGA-III reaches the best results regarding the quality indicators for all instances, but taking a longer time. Besides, PCA-NSGA-II can find different solutions in the search space that are not found by NSGA-III.},

abstract = {Managing in a generic way the evolution process of feature-oriented Software Product Lines (spls) is complex due to the number of elements that are impacted and the heterogeneity of the spls regarding artifacts used to define them. Existing work presents specific approaches to manage the evolution of spls in terms of such artifacts, i.e., assets, feature models and relation definitions. Moreover stakeholders do not necessarily master all the knowledge of the spl making its evolution difficult and error-prone without a proper tool support. In order to deal with these issues, we introduce SPLEmma, a generic framework that follows a Model Driven Engineering approach to capture the evolution of a spl independently of the kind of assets, technologies or feature models used for the product derivation. Authorized changes are described by the spl maintainer and captured in a model used to generate tools that guide the evolution process and preserve the consistency of the whole spl. We report on the application of our approach on two spls: YourCast for digital signage systems, and SALOON, which enables generation of configurations for cloud providers.},

The speed offered by agile practices is needed to hit the market, while reuse is needed for long-term productivity, efficiency, and profit. The paper presents an empirical investigation of factors influencing speed and reuse in three large product developing organizations seeking to implement Agile practices. The paper identifies, through a multiple case study with 3 organizations, 114 business-, process-, organizational-, architecture-, knowledge- and communication factors with positive or negative influences on reuse, speed or both. Contributions are a categorized inventory of influencing factors, a display for organizing factors for the purpose of process improvement work, and a list of key improvement areas to address when implementing reuse in organizations striving to become more Agile. Categories identified include good factors with positive influences on reuse or speed, harmful factors with negative influences, and complex factors involving inverse or ambiguous relationships. Key improvement areas in the studied organizations are intra-organizational communication practices, reuse awareness and practices, architectural integration and variability management. Results are intended to support process improvement work in the direction of Agile product development. Feedback on results from the studied organizations has been that the inventory captures current situations, and is useful for software process improvement work.},

To meet their deadlines, start-ups take shortcuts in software development leading to the accumulation of technical debt. They are able to put their product in users hands faster, get feedback, and improve at the expense of quality issues in the long run. As a start-up evolves through inception, stabilization and growth this debt will have to be managed. Technical debt management and software product line engineering techniques have some similar benefits of increased productivity and reduced time-to-market. Our aim is to check whether software product line engineering can be a candidate technique for start-ups to employ in managing technical debt as a response to their life-cycle phase goals and challenges. We conducted expert interviews with nine start-up professionals to identify the strategies applied in relation to technical debt management and software product lines engineering and other software engineering practices in start-ups. By analyzing the responses from the interviews we found that depending on the life-cycle phase of the start-up software product line engineering proved effective in managing technical debt and helped the start-ups to advance through the life-cycle phases.},

abstract = {Context: Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the discipline of controlling the evolution of large and complex software systems. Over the years many different SCM systems sharing similar concepts have been implemented from scratch. Since these concepts usually are hard-wired into the respective program code, reuse is hardly possible. Objective: Our objective is to create a model-driven product line for SCM systems. By explicitly describing the different concepts using models, reuse can be performed on the modeling level. Since models are executable, the need for manual programming is eliminated. Furthermore, by providing a library of loosely coupled modules, we intend to support flexible composition of SCM systems. Method: We developed a method and a tool set for model-driven software product line engineering which we applied to the SCM domain. For domain analysis, we applied the FORM method, resulting in a layered feature model for SCM systems. Furthermore, we developed an executable object-oriented domain model which was annotated with features from the feature model. A specific SCM system is configured by selecting features from the feature model and elements of the domain model realizing these features. Results: Due to the orthogonality of both feature model and domain model, a very large number of SCM systems may be configured. We tested our approach by creating instances of the product line which mimic wide-spread systems such as CVS, GIT, Mercurial, and Subversion. Conclusion: The experiences gained from this project demonstrate the feasibility of our approach to model-driven software product line engineering.

abstract = {A fundamental problem of testing Software Product Lines (SPLs) is that variability enables the production of a large number of instances and it is difficult to construct and run test cases even for SPLs with a small number of variable features. Interacting features is a foundation of a fault model for SPLs, where faults are likely to be revealed at execution points where features exchange information with other features or influence one another. Therefore, a test adequacy criterion is to cover as many interactions among different features as possible, thus increasing the probability of finding bugs. Our approach combines a combinatorial designs algorithm for pairwise feature generation with model-based testing to reduce the size of the SPL required for comprehensive coverage of interacting features. We implemented our approach and applied it to an SPL from the automotive domain provided by one of our industrial partners. The results suggest that with our approach higher coverage of feature interactions is achieved at a fraction of cost when compared with a baseline approach of testing all feature interactions.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of supporting usability in the early stages of a product line architecture design. The product line used as an example is intended to support a variety of different products each with a radically different user interface. The development cycles for new products varies between three years and five years and usability is valued as an important quality attribute for each product in the line.Traditionally, usability is achieved in a product by designing according to specific usability guidelines, and then performing user tests. User interface design can be performed separately from software architecture design and prototyping, but user tests cannot be performed before detailed UI design and prototyping. If the user tests discover usability problems leading to required architectural changes, the company would not know about this until two years after the architecture design was complete. This problem was addressed by identifying a collection of 19 well known usability scenarios that require architectural support. In our example, the stakeholders for the product line prioritized three of these scenarios as key product-line scenarios for improving usability. For each of these three chosen product-line scenarios we developed an architectural responsibility pattern that provided support for the scenario. The responsibilities are expressed in terms of architectural requirements with implementation details and rationales. The responsibilities were embodied in a web based tool for the architects.The two architects for the product line developed a preliminary design and then reviewed their design against the responsibilities supporting the scenarios. The process of review took a day and the architects conservatively estimated that it saved them five weeks of effort later in the project.},

Typically, multi product lines (MPLs) cannot be managed centrally as the involved product lines are developed and evolved by multiple teams that often work independently. Support for modularity and the management of dependencies are thus essential in MPLs. We aim at developing a tool-supported approach for modularizing MPLs to facilitate product derivation in MPLs. We elicit requirements for MPL tool support based on a literature survey and by involving experts from our industry partners. Our approach is based on product line bundles which allow to organize and deploy product line models and specific tool support. We also support the distributed configuration of a MPL based on different types of dependencies between product lines. We will evaluate our research in the laboratory and industrial case studies. We will also conduct experiments to assess the usefulness of the developed tool features.},

However, in the practice many organizations at first develop a number of similar software products without explicitly planning for strategic reuse. In consequence, subsequent attempts to introduce reuse require a significant restructuring of the existing products. The restructuring is difficult because the precise information about the distribution of commonality and variability in the source code of the variants is often not available.The ongoing PhD thesis presented in this paper contributes to easing the task of extractive software reuse adoption: it proposes a reverse engineering approach for extracting the variability information from the source code of similar software products and outlines a method that guides the organization towards optimal use of this information in the process of planning and introducing software reuse.},

In this paper, we investigate the impact of refactoring variants on the feature location techniques. We first evaluate the performance of two techniques through the ArgoUML SPL benchmark when the variants are refactored. We then discuss the degraded results and the possibility of restoring them. Finally, we outline a process of variant alignment that aims to preserve the performance of the feature location.},

abstract = {Software-product-line engineering has gained considerable momentum in recent years, both in industry and in academia. A software product line is a family of software products that share a common set of features. Software product lines challenge traditional analysis techniques, such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving, in their quest of ensuring correctness and reliability of software. Simply creating and analyzing all products of a product line is usually not feasible, due to the potentially exponential number of valid feature combinations. Recently, researchers began to develop analysis techniques that take the distinguishing properties of software product lines into account, for example, by checking feature-related code in isolation or by exploiting variability information during analysis. The emerging field of product-line analyses is both broad and diverse, so it is difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand their similarities and differences. We propose a classification of product-line analyses to enable systematic research and application. Based on our insights with classifying and comparing a corpus of 123 research articles, we develop a research agenda to guide future research on product-line analyses.},

abstract = {In the software product line configuration process, certain features are selected based on the stakeholders' needs and preferences regarding the available functional and quality properties. This book chapter presents how a product configuration can be modeled as a decision process and how an optimal strategy representing the stakeholders' desirable configuration can be found. In the decision process model of product configuration, the product is configured by making decisions at a number of decision points. The decisions at each of these decision points contribute to functional and quality attributes of the final product. In order to find an optimal strategy for the decision process, a utility-based approach can be adopted, through which, the strategy with the highest utility is selected as the optimal strategy. In order to define utility for each strategy, a multi-attribute utility function is defined over functional and quality properties of a configured product and a utility elicitation process is then introduced for finding this utility function. The utility elicitation process works based on asking gamble queries over functional and quality requirement from the stakeholder. Using this utility function, the optimal strategy and therefore optimal product configuration is determined.},

abstract = {The digital transformation of the automotive industry has a significant impact on how development processes need to be organized in future. Dynamic market and technological environments require capabilities to react on changes and to learn fast. Agile methods are a promising approach to address these needs but they are not tailored to the specific characteristics of the automotive domain like product line development. Although, there have been efforts to apply agile methods in the automotive domain for many years, significant and widespread adoptions have not yet taken place. The goal of this literature review is to gain an overview and a better understanding of agile methods for embedded software development in the automotive domain, especially with respect to product line development. A mapping study was conducted to analyze the relation between agile software development, embedded software development in the automotive domain and software product line development. Three research questions were defined and 68 papers were evaluated. The study shows that agile and product line development approaches tailored for the automotive domain are not yet fully explored in the literature. Especially, literature on the combination of agile and product line development is rare. Most of the examined combinations are customizations of generic approaches or approaches stemming from other domains. Although, only few approaches for combining agile and software product line development in the automotive domain were found, these findings were valuable for identifying research gaps and provide insights into how existing approaches can be combined, extended and tailored to suit the characteristics of the automotive domain.},

Our approach guarantees for every product configuration stable test coverage and allows the derivation of redundancy-reduced, yet reliable retesting obligations.

Product line approaches are applied because large numbers of different product variants need to be developed simultaneously. During development, updated versions of each projected product variant need to be derived from the product line assets repeatedly. Current build tools create each of the numerous product variants one after another. Accordingly, the creation process can take much time. This paper presents an approach to abbreviate this creation process based on the fact that multiple product variants created at once can have parts in common. To benefit from this optimization potential the workflow that creates an individual product variant is subdivided into multiple fragments. Whenever a set of such product variants needs to be created, an optimization algorithm then calculates an individual execution order of the fragments for this set. This order minimizes the total execution time by a systematic reuse of workflow fragment's results for the creation of multiple different product variants.},

abstract = {Modern software systems should be designed to dynamically adapt to changing user requirements or resource constraints. Delta-oriented programming (DOP) is a compositional approach to flexibly implement software product lines. In DOP, a product line is represented by a code base and a product line declaration. The code base consists of a set of delta modules specifying modifications to object-oriented programs. The product line declaration provides the connection of the delta modules with the product features and describes how the product for a particular feature configuration is generated. DOP has so far only been used for static variability. In this paper, we present dynamic DOP, an extension of DOP that supports changing the feature configuration of a product at runtime. A dynamic DOP product line is a standard DOP product line with a reconfiguration automaton that specifies how to switch between different feature configurations. The type system of our dynamic DOP language ensures that any reconfiguration leads to a type safe product. Dynamic DOP is an approach for realizing dynamic product lines which also supports (unanticipated) software evolution.},

abstract = {With more than 11,000 optional and alternative features, the Linux kernel is a highly configurable piece of software. Linux is generally perceived as a textbook example for preprocessor-based product derivation, but more than 65 percent of all features are actually handled by the build system. Hence, variability-aware static analysis tools have to take the build system into account.However, extracting variability information from the build system is difficult due to the declarative and turing-complete make language. Existing approaches based on text processing do not cover this challenges and tend to be tailored to a specific Linux version and architecture. This renders them practically unusable as a basis for variability-aware tool support -- Linux is a moving target!We describe a robust approach for extracting implementation variability from the Linux build system. Instead of extracting the variability information by a text-based analysis of all build scripts, our approach exploits the build system itself to produce this information. As our results show, our approach is robust and works for all versions and architectures from the (git-)history of Linux.},

abstract = {Today's product development creates multiple products over time, often by using reuse strategies like "Clone and Own", leading to very inefficient reuse of artifacts in the long term since synergy effects between the products e.g. from testing cannot be utilized. Applying a product line approach with explicitly modeling the commonalities and variabilities of system artifacts and deriving products from that common base is a way to tackle the problem. High variant complexity can often be found in the development of embedded systems, which in turn often control safety critical functions. For these systems functional safety is a major concern not only since the ISO 26262 got relevant for the automotive industry. The arising question is: Can variability in functional safety related assets be treated in the same way as for other artifacts like requirements, models, and source code? In this paper we demonstrate on the example of two commercial tools and an automotive use case that from the technical/tool point of view safety related artifacts can be treated like other artifacts regarding variability. This means linking with variability information and visualizing as well as deriving of variants is feasible. This is a big step forward, because now not only ordinary artifacts but also functional safety related assets can be reused in the same way as other product line artifacts. However, we have identified and will discuss challenges with respect to variable safety analyses, regulations, and reuse of certifications, which need further research and elaboration, in this paper.},

abstract = {Variability is a key aspect in software product lines. Functional variability has been largely studied as a way to obtain all the desired products for a line. Quality variability, less understood and more complex, has not received so much attention by researchers. However, different members of the line may require different levels of a quality attribute. The design phase is a good point to assure that quality attributes requirements are met within the product line so this means paying attention to software architecture evaluation during Domain Engineering. The quality evaluation in software product lines is much more complicated than in single-systems as products can require different quality levels and the product line can have variability on design that in turn affects quality. The evaluation of all the products of a line is very expensive. Thus, ways of reducing the evaluation efforts are necessary. Herein is presented a method for facilitating cost-effective quality evaluation of a product line taking into consideration variability on quality attributes.},

We built into the RPG-PLA a number of performance optimization strategies that could benefit any of the four (and possibly other similar) RPGs. By comparing the original vs. the new RPGs derived from the RPG-PLA, we demonstrated that reuse allowed us to achieve improved performance, both speed and memory utilization, as compared to each game developed individually. At the same time, our solution facilitated rapid development of new games, for new mobile devices, as well as ease of evolving with new features the RPG-PLA and custom games already in use.},

abstract = {Product line engineering (PLE) has been employed to large-scale cyber-physical systems (CPSs) to provide customization based on users’ needs. A PLE methodology can be characterized by its support for capturing and managing the abstractions as commonalities and variabilities and the automation of the configuration process for effective selection and customization of reusable artifacts. The automation of a configuration process heavily relies on the captured abstractions and formally specified constraints using a well-defined modeling methodology. Based on the results of our previous work and a thorough literature review, in this paper, we propose a conceptual framework to support multi-stage and multi-step automated product configuration of CPSs, including a comprehensive classification of constraints and a list of automated functionalities of a CPS configuration solution. Such a framework can serve as a guide for researchers and practitioners to evaluate an existing CPS PLE solution or devise a novel CPS PLE solution. To validate the framework, we conducted three real-world case studies. Results show that the framework fulfills all the requirements of the case studies in terms of capturing and managing variabilities and constraints. Results of the literature review indicate that the framework covers all the functionalities concerned by the literature, suggesting that the framework is complete for enabling the maximum automation of configuration in CPS PLE.},

abstract = {Variational systems can produce a (potentially huge) number of related systems, known as products or variants, by using features (configuration options) to mark the variable functionality. In many of the application domains, their rigorous verification and analysis are very important, yet the appropriate tools rarely are able to analyse variational systems. Recently, this problem was addressed by designing specialized so-called family-based model checking algorithms, which allow simultaneous verification of all variants in a single run by exploiting the commonalities between the variants. Yet, their computational cost still greatly depends on the number of variants (the size of configuration space), which is often huge. Moreover, their implementation and maintenance represent a costly research and development task. One of the most promising approaches to fighting the configuration space explosion problem is variability abstractions, which simplify variability away from variational systems. In this work, we show how to achieve efficient family-based model checking of CTL⋆ temporal properties using variability abstractions and off-the-shelf (single-system) tools. We use variability abstractions for deriving abstract family-based model checking, where the variability model of a variational system is replaced with an abstract (smaller) version of it, called modal transition system, which preserves the satisfaction of both universal and existential temporal properties, as expressible in CTL⋆. Modal transition systems contain two kinds of transitions, termed may- and must-transitions, which are defined by the conservative (over-approximating) abstractions and their dual (under-approximating) abstractions, respectively. The variability abstractions can be combined with different partitionings of the configuration space to infer suitable divide-and-conquer verification plans for the given variational system. We illustrate the practicality of this approach for several variational systems using the standard version of (single-system) NuSMV model checker.},

To alleviate these problems, in this paper, we present an improved version of a family mining approach for automatically discovering commonality and variability between related system variants.

abstract = {Variability is the ability of a software system or artifacts to be changed, customized, or configured for reuse in the product members of a software product line. As the amount of variability increases in software product lines the complexity of managing changes and evolutions of such variability becomes a main concern these days. In this context a high-degree of traceability can support the complexity of variability change management. However, in software product line establishing appropriate traceability is often difficult due to many-to-many relations in different levels of abstraction and across development given two separated and closely related development life cycles called domain and application. This paper proposes an approach tracing variability based on explicit variation points defined in orthogonal variability model and domain artifacts. And we validate the proposed approach through the Calculator product line. As the results of validation we found that our approach supports the defined variability change scenarios well, but has a disadvantage that many derived variation points are additionally defined and managed.},

abstract = {A software product line (SPL) represents a family of products in a given application domain. Each SPL is constructed to provide for the derivation of new products by covering a wide range of features in its domain. Nevertheless, over time, some domain features may become obsolete with the apparition of new features while others may become refined. Accordingly, the SPL must be maintained to account for the domain evolution. Such evolution requires a means for managing the impact of changes on the SPL models, including the feature model and design. This paper presents an automated method that analyzes feature model evolution, traces their impact on the SPL design, and offers a set of recommendations to ensure the consistency of both models. The proposed method defines a set of new metrics adapted to SPL evolution to identify the effort needed to maintain the SPL models consistently and with a quality as good as the original models. The method and its tool are illustrated through an example of an SPL in the Text Editing domain. In addition, they are experimentally evaluated in terms of both the quality of the maintained SPL models and the precision of the impact change management.},

Feature Oriented Programming (FOP) is a technique to develop SPLs that aims to improve the modularity and flexibility of feature code. The basic idea of FOP is to decompose software into smaller pieces, called features, so they can be composed according to the needs of each customer. Currently, Groovy programming language has no tool or framework that supports the implementation of FOP-SPLs. Groovy is a programming language that has been growing in popularity in recent years. Given this scenario, this work proposes and evaluates G4FOP, a light way to develop SPLs using Groovy. G4FOP extends FeatureHouse which is a framework for software composition and FOP. A preliminary evaluation shows that G4FOP covers Groovy grammar. We also demonstrate by an example that G4FOP is suitable to develop SPLs. G4FOP is currently integrated to the official FeatureHouse repository.},

In the FineFit approach, the model is expressed by a set of tables based on Parnas tables. A software product line is a family of programs (the products) with well-defined commonalities and variabilities that are developed by (re)using common artifacts. In this paper, we address the issue of using the FineFit approach to support the development of correct software product lines. We specify a software product line as a specification product line where each product is a FineFit specification of the corresponding software product. The main challenge is to concisely specify the software product line while retaining the readability of the specification of a single system. To address this, we used delta-oriented programming, a recently proposed flexible approach for implementing software product lines, and developed: (1) delta tables as a means to apply the delta-oriented programming idea to the specification of software product lines; and (2) DeltaFineFit as a novel model-based testing approach for software product lines.},

abstract = {Software that support various groups of customers usually require complicated configurations to attain different functionalities. To model the configuration options, feature model is proposed to capture the commonalities and competing variabilities of the product variants in software family or Software Product Line (SPL). A key challenge for deriving a new product is to find a set of features that do not have inconsistencies or conflicts, yet optimize multiple objectives (e.g., minimizing cost and maximizing number of features), which are often competing with each other. Existing works have attempted to make use of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to address this problem. In this work, we incorporated a novel feedback-directed mechanism into existing EAs. Our empirical results have shown that our method has improved noticeably over all unguided version of EAs on the optimal feature selection. In particular, for case studies in SPLOT and LVAT repositories, the feedback-directed Indicator-Based EA (IBEA) has increased the number of correct solutions found by 72.33% and 75%, compared to unguided IBEA. In addition, by leveraging a pre-computed solution, we have found 34 sound solutions for Linux X86, which contains 6888 features, in less than 40 seconds.},

abstract = {More and more approaches propose to use Software Product Lines (SPLs) modelling techniques to implement dynamic adaptive systems. The resulting Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) present new challenges since the variability transformations used to derive alternative configurations have to be intensively used at runtime. This paper proposes to use the Common Variability Language (CVL) for modelling runtime variability and evaluates a set of alternative strategies for implementing the associated variability transformations. All the proposed strategies have been implemented and evaluated on the case-study of a smart-home system. Results show that the proposed strategies provide the same reconfiguration service with significant differences in quality-of-service.},

abstract = {Software product lines (SPLs) are based on reuse rationale to aid quick and quality delivery of complex products at scale. Deriving a new product from a product line requires reuse analysis to avoid redundancy and support a high degree of assets reuse. In this paper, we propose and evaluate automated support for recommending SPL assets that can be reused to realize new customer requirements. Using the existing customer requirements as input, the approach applies natural language processing and clustering to generate reuse recommendations for unseen customer requirements in new projects. The approach is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively in the railway industry. Results show that our approach can recommend reuse with 74% accuracy and 57.4% exact match. The evaluation further indicates that the recommendations are relevant to engineers and can support the product derivation and feasibility analysis phase of the projects. The results encourage further study on automated reuse analysis on other levels of abstractions.},

abstract = {Software product family or line is a software engineering paradigm that systematizes reuse. In Software Product Line Engineering, two phases are distinguished: Domain Engineering which is in charge of developing a common infrastructure and assets and Application Engineering which makes use of those assets to generate the products. One of the key aspects of product lines is variability and its management. However, the main focus has been on functional variability and quality variability in software product lines has not received so much attention by researchers. In a product line different members of the line may require different levels of a quality requirement, for instance they could differ in terms of their availability, security, reliability, etc. Due to this variability, quality evaluation in software product lines is much more complicated that in single-systems. One alternative is to evaluate all the products of a line but it is very expensive and ways of reducing evaluation efforts are necessary. In this direction, the paper presents a method for facilitating cost-effective quality evaluation of a product line taking into consideration variability on quality attributes.},

abstract = {ContextVariability management (VM) is one of the most important activities of software product-line engineering (SPLE), which intends to develop software-intensive systems using platforms and mass customization. VM encompasses the activities of eliciting and representing variability in software artefacts, establishing and managing dependencies among different variabilities, and supporting the exploitation of the variabilities for building and evolving a family of software systems. Software product line (SPL) community has allocated huge amount of effort to develop various approaches to dealing with variability related challenges during the last two decade. Several dozens of VM approaches have been reported. However, there has been no systematic effort to study how the reported VM approaches have been evaluated. ObjectiveThe objectives of this research are to review the status of evaluation of reported VM approaches and to synthesize the available evidence about the effects of the reported approaches. MethodWe carried out a systematic literature review of the VM approaches in SPLE reported from 1990s until December 2007. ResultsWe selected 97 papers according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected papers appeared in 56 publication venues. We found that only a small number of the reviewed approaches had been evaluated using rigorous scientific methods. A detailed investigation of the reviewed studies employing empirical research methods revealed significant quality deficiencies in various aspects of the used quality assessment criteria. The synthesis of the available evidence showed that all studies, except one, reported only positive effects. ConclusionThe findings from this systematic review show that a large majority of the reported VM approaches have not been sufficiently evaluated using scientifically rigorous methods. The available evidence is sparse and the quality of the presented evidence is quite low. The findings highlight the areas in need of improvement, i.e., rigorous evaluation of VM approaches. However, the reported evidence is quite consistent across different studies. That means the proposed approaches may be very beneficial when they are applied properly in appropriate situations. Hence, it can be concluded that further investigations need to pay more attention to the contexts under which different approaches can be more beneficial.},

abstract = {We introduce the feature-oriented language FLan as a proof of concept for specifying both declarative aspects of product families, namely constraints on their features, and procedural aspects, namely feature configuration and run-time behaviour. FLan is inspired by the concurrent constraint programming paradigm. A store of constraints allows one to specify in a declarative way all common constraints on features, including inter-feature constraints. A standard yet rich set of process-algebraic operators allows one to specify in a procedural way the configuration and behaviour of products. There is a close interaction between both views: (i) the execution of a process is constrained by its store to forbid undesired configurations; (ii) a process can query a store to resolve design and behavioural choices; (iii) a process can update the store by adding new features. An implementation in the Maude framework allows for a variety of formal automated analyses of product families specified in FLan, ranging from consistency checking to model checking.},

Offering highly configurable applications to thousands of tenants in a shared cloud environment demands for scalable configuration management. Based on an example scenario taken from the Indenica project, we identify requirements for applying methods from software product line (SPL) engineering to configure cloud-based multi-tenant aware applications. Using an extended feature model (EFM) to express variability of functionality and service qualities, we propose a concept for dynamic configuration management to address the identified requirements. Our proposed configuration management includes an adaptive staged configuration process that is capable of adding and removing stakeholders dynamically and that allows for reconfiguration of variants as stakeholders' objectives change.},

Despite the importance and complexity of bug-fixing, there is still a lack of empirical data about the difficulties found in industrial Software Product Lines (SPLs). [Aims] This paper aims to evaluate engineers' performance fixing errors and propagating the fixes to other configured products in the context of an industrial SPL. [Method] We designed and conducted an empirical study to collect data with regard to bug-fixing tasks within the context of a Induction Hob SPL in the BSH group, the largest manufacturer of home appliances in Europe. [Results] We found that effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction got reached good values. Through interviews we also found difficulties related to unused features, cloning features unintentionally, detecting modified features, and propagating the fix when the source of the bug is the interaction between features. [Conclusions] The identified difficulties are relevant to know how to better apply SPLs in industry in the future.},

However, this architectural style supports only the commonalities among tenants and doesnot cope with the variations and the specific context of each tenant. These variations concern either functionalor non-functional properties. In this paper, we deal with non-functional variability in SaaS services in orderto support the different quality levels that a service may have. For that purpose, we propose an approachthat considers Service Level Agreements (SLAs) as Families in terms of Software Product Line Engineering.We define two metamodels: NFVariability metamodel and VariableSLA metamodel. The first one modelsand captures variability in quality attributes of services. The second one models a dynamic and variableSLA. Model-to-model transformations are performed to transform Feature Model (NFVariability metamodelinstance) to Generic SLA (VariableSLA instance) in order to dynamically deal with the tenant-specific nonfunctionalrequirements.},

abstract = {Control flow models, such as UML activity diagrams or Petri nets, are widely accepted modeling languages used to support quality assurance activities in single system engineering as well as software product line (SPL) engineering. Quality assurance in product line engineering is a challenging task since a defect in a domain artifact may affect several products of the product line. Thus, proper quality assurance approaches need to pay special attention to the product line variability. Automation is essential to support quality assurance approaches. A prerequisite for automation is a profound formalization of the underlying control flow models and, in the context of SPLs, of the variability therein. In this paper, we propose a formal syntax and semantics for defining variability in Petri nets. We use these extended Petri nets as a foundation to formally define variability in UML activity diagrams; UML activity diagrams serve as a basis for several testing techniques in product line engineering. We illustrate the contribution of such a formalization to assurance activities in product line engineering by describing its usage in three application examples.},

abstract = {The Multi-objective Optimization Approach for Product Line Architecture Design (MOA4PLA) is the seminal approach that successfully optimizes Product Line Architecture (PLA) design using search algorithms. The tool named OPLA-Tool was developed in order to automate the use of MOA4PLA. Over time, the customization of the tool to suit the needs of new research and application scenarios led to several problems. The main problems identified in the original version of OPLA-Tool are environment configuration, maintainability and usability problems, and PLA design modeling and visualization. Such problems motivated the development of a new version of this tool: OPLA-Tool v2.0, presented in this work. In this version, those problems were solved by the source code refactoring, migration to a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) and inclusion of a new support tool for PLA modeling and visualization. Furthermore, OPLA-Tool v2.0 has new functionalities, such as new objective functions, new search operators, intelligent interaction with users during the optimization process, multi-user authentication and simultaneous execution of several experiments to PLA optimization. Such a new version of OPLA-Tool is an important achievement to PLA design optimization as it provides an easier and more complete way to automate this task.},

abstract = {In research of cognitive psychology, experiments to measure cognitive processes may be run in many similar yet slightly different configurations. Variability engineering offers techniques to handle variable configurations both conceptually and technically. However, these techniques are largely unknown to cognitive psychologists so that experiment configurations are specified informally or too coarse grain. This is problematic, because it becomes difficult to get an overview of paradigm configurations used in the so far conducted experiments. Variability engineering techniques provide, i.a., concise notations for capturing variability in software and can also be used to express the configurable nature of a wide range of experiments in cognitive psychology. Furthermore, it enables cognitive psychologists to structure configuration knowledge, to identify suitably similar experiment setups and to more efficiently identify individual configuration options as relevant reasons for a particular effect in the outcome of an experiment. In this paper, we present experiences with teaching variability engineering to cognitive psychologists along with a suitable curriculum.},

abstract = {Software reuse lowers development costs and improves the quality of software systems. Two strategies are common: clone &amp; own (copying and adapting a system) and platform-oriented reuse (building a configurable platform). The former is readily available, flexible, and initially cheap, but does not scale with the frequency of reuse, imposing high maintenance costs. The latter scales, but imposes high upfront investments for building the platform, and reduces flexibility. As such, each strategy has distinctive advantages and disadvantages, imposing different development activities and software architectures. Deciding for one strategy is a core decision with long-term impact on an organization’s software development. Unfortunately, the strategies’ costs are not well-understood - not surprisingly, given the lack of systematically elicited empirical data, which is difficult to collect. We present an empirical study of the development activities, costs, cost factors, and benefits associated with either reuse strategy. For this purpose, we combine quantitative and qualitative data that we triangulated from 26 interviews at a large organization and a systematic literature review covering 57 publications. Our study both confirms and refutes common hypotheses on software reuse. For instance, we confirm that developing for platform-oriented reuse is more expensive, but simultaneously reduces reuse costs; and that platform-orientation results in higher code quality compared to clone &amp; own. Surprisingly, refuting common hypotheses, we find that change propagation can be more expensive in a platform, that platforms can facilitate the advancement into innovative markets, and that there is no strict distinction of clone &amp; own and platform-oriented reuse in practice.},

abstract = {The Web systems domain has faced an increasing number of devices, browsers, and platforms to cope with, driving software systems to be more flexible to accomodate them. Software product line (SPL) engineering can be used as a strategy to implement systems capable of handling such a diversity. To this end, automated tool support is almost indispensable. However, current tool support gives more emphasis to modeling variability in the problem domain, over the support of variability at the solution domain. There is a need for mapping the variability between both abstraction levels, so as to determine what implementation impact a certain variability has. In this paper, we propose the FeatureJS, a FeatureIDE extension aiming at Javascript and HTML support for SPL engineering. The tool combines feature-oriented programming and preprocessors, as a strategy to map variability at source code with the variability modeled at a higher level of abstraction. We carried out a preliminary evaluation with an industrial project, aiming to characterize the capability of the tool to handle SPL engineering in the Web systems domain.},

abstract = {Software Product Line (SPL) engineering has emerged to provide the means to efficiently model, produce, and maintain multiple similar software variants, exploiting their common properties, and managing their variabilities (differences). With over two decades of existence, the community of SPL researchers and practitioners is thriving, as can be attested by the extensive research output and the numerous successful industrial projects. Education has a key role to support the next generation of practitioners to build highly complex, variability-intensive systems. Yet, it is unclear how the concepts of variability and SPLs are taught, what are the possible missing gaps and difficulties faced, what are the benefits, and what is the material available. Also, it remains unclear whether scholars teach what is actually needed by industry. In this article, we report on three initiatives we have conducted with scholars, educators, industry practitioners, and students to further understand the connection between SPLs and education, that is, an online survey on teaching SPLs we performed with 35 scholars, another survey on learning SPLs we conducted with 25 students, as well as two workshops held at the International Software Product Line Conference in 2014 and 2015 with both researchers and industry practitioners participating. We build upon the two surveys and the workshops to derive recommendations for educators to continue improving the state of practice of teaching SPLs, aimed at both individual educators as well as the wider community.},

abstract = {Software product line engineering and service-oriented architectures both enable organizations to capitalize on reuse of existing software assets and capabilities and improve competitive advantage in terms of development savings, product flexibility, time-to-market. Both approaches accommodate variation of assets, including services, by changing the software being reused or composing services according a new orchestration. Therefore, variability management in Service-oriented Product Lines (SoPL) is one of the main challenges today. In order to highlight the emerging evidence-based results from the research community, we apply the well-defined method of systematic mapping in order to populate a classification scheme for the SoPL field of interest. The analysis of results throws light on the current open issues. Moreover, different facets of the scheme can be combined to answer more specific research questions. The report reveals the need for more empirical research able to provide new metrics measuring efficiency and efficacy of the proposed models, new methods and tools supporting variability management in SoPL, especially during maintenance and verification and validation. The mapping study about SoPL opens further investigations by means of a complete systematic review to select and validate the most efficient solutions to variability management in SoPL.},

abstract = {A software product line is a family of related programs that are distinguished in terms of features. A feature implements a stakeholders' requirement. Different program variants specified by distinct feature selections are produced from a common code base. The optional feature problem describes a common mismatch between variability intended in the domain and dependencies in the implementation. When this situation occurs, some variants that are valid in the domain cannot be produced due to implementation issues. There are many different solutions to the optional feature problem, but they all suffer from drawbacks such as reduced variability, increased development effort, reduced efficiency, or reduced source code quality. We examine the impact of the optional feature problem in two case studies from the domain of embedded database systems, and we survey different state-of-the-art solutions and their trade-offs. Our intension is to raise awareness of the problem, to guide developers in selecting an appropriate solution for their product line, and to identify opportunities for future research.},

abstract = {Search-based algorithms have been successfully applied in the Product Line Architecture (PLA) optimization using the seminal approach called Multi-Objective Approach for Product-Line Architecture Design (MOA4PLA). This approach produces a set of alternative PLA designs intending to improve the different factors being optimized. Currently, the MOA4PLA uses the NSGA-II algorithm, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) that can optimize several architectural properties simultaneously. Despite the promising results, studying the best values for the algorithm parameters is essential to obtain even better results. This is also crucial to ease the adoption of MOA4PLA by newcomers or non-expert companies willing to start using search-based software engineering to PLA design. Three crossover operators for the PLA design optimization were proposed recently. However, reference values for parameters have not been defined for PLA design optimization using crossover operators. In this context, the objective of this work is conducting an experimental study to discover which are the most effective crossover operators and the best values to configure the MOEA parameters, such as population size, number of generations, and mutation and crossover rates. A quantitative analysis based on quality indicators and statistical tests was performed using four PLA designs to determine the most suitable parameter values to the search-based algorithm. Empirical results pointed out the best combination of crossover operators and the most suitable values to configure MOA4PLA.},

In the heterogeneous scenario of this new paradigm, the development of applications using cloud services becomes hard, and the software product lines (SPL) approach is potentially promising for this context since specificities of the cloud platforms, such as services heterogeneity, pricing model, and other aspects can be catered as variabilities to core features. In this perspective, this paper (i) proposes a seamless adaptation of the SPL-based development to include important features of cloud-based applications, and (ii) reports the experience of developing HW-CSPL, a SPL for the Health Watcher (HW) System, which allows citizens to register complaints and consult information regarding the public health system of a city. Several functionalities of this system were implemented using different Cloud Computing platforms, and run time specificities of this application deployed on the cloud were analyzed, as well as other information such as change impact and pricing.},

They provide a visual abstraction of the variation points in a family of related software products. FMs can be manually created by domain experts or extracted (semi-) automatically from textual documents such as product descriptions or requirements specifications. Nevertheless, there is no way to measure the accuracy of a FM with respect to the information described in the source documents. This paper proposes a method to quantify and visualize whether the elements in a FM (features and relationships) conform to the information available in a set of specification documents. Both the correctness (choice of representative elements) and completeness (no missing elements) of the FM are considered. Designers can use this feedback to fix defects in the FM or to detect incomplete or inconsistent information in the source documents.},

A configuration problem is defined as generating the most optimal combination of software features given a requirements specification and given a set of configuration rules. Current approaches however provide little support for expressing complex configuration rules between problem and solution space that support incomplete requirements specifications. In this paper, we propose an approach to model complex configuration rules based on a generalization of the concept of problem-solution feature interactions. These are interactions between solution-space features that only arise in specific problem contexts. The use of an existing tool to support our approach is also discussed: we use the DLV answer set solver to express a particular configuration problem as a logic program whose answer set corresponds to the optimal combinations of solution-space features. We motivate and illustrate our approach with a case study in the field of managing dynamic adaptations in distributed software, where the goal is to generate an optimal protocol for accommodating a given adaptation.},

abstract = {During our work on developing and running a software product line for eco-sustainable greenhouse-production software tools, which currently have three products members we have identified a need for extending the notation of the Orthogonal Variability Model (OVM) to support what we refer to as cardinality range dependencies. The cardinality-range-dependency type enables expressing that the binding of a certain number of variants to a variation point can influence variability in other places in the model. In other words, we acknowledge that variability can be influenced, not necessarily by the specific variants being bound, but by their sheer numbers.This paper contributes with an extension to the meta-model underlying the OVM notation, suggesting a notation for the new type of dependency and shows its applicability. The specific case, which initially required this extension, will work as running example throughout the paper and underline the need for the extension. Finally, the paper evaluates and discusses the general applicability of the proposed notation extension and future perspectives.},

abstract = {Product line (PL)-based development is a thriving research area to develop software-intensive systems. Feature models (FMs) facilitate derivation of valid products from a PL by managing commonalities and variabilities among software products. However, the researchers in academia as well as in the industries experience difficulties in quality assessment of FMs. The increasing complexity and size of FMs may lead to defects, which outweigh the benefits of PL. This paper provides a systematic literature review and key research issues related to the FM defects in PL. We derive a typology of FM defects according to their level of importance. The information on defects’ identification and explanations are provided with formalization. Further, corrective explanations are presented which incorporates various techniques used to fix defects with their implementation. This information would help software engineering community by enabling developers or modelers to find the types of defects and their causes and to choose an appropriate technique to fix defects in order to produce defect-free products from FMs, thereby enhancing the overall quality of PL-based development.},

abstract = {Deriving a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) product from a product line requires configuring hundreds to thousands of configurable parameters of components and devices from multiple domains, e.g., computing, control, and communication. A fully automated configuration process for a CPS product line is seldom possible in practice, and a dynamic and interactive process is expected. Therefore, some configurable parameters are to be configured manually, and the rest can be configured either automatically or manually, depending on pre-defined constraints, the order of configuration steps, and previous configuration data in such a dynamic and interactive configuration process. In this article, we propose a pattern-based, interactive configuration derivation methodology (named as Pi-CD) to maximize opportunities of automatically deriving correct configurations of CPSs by benefiting from pre-defined constraints and configuration data of previous configuration steps. Pi-CD requires architectures of CPS product lines modeled with Unified Modeling Language extended with four types of variabilities, along with constraints specified in Object Constraint Language (OCL). Pi-CD is equipped with 324 configuration derivation patterns that we defined by systematically analyzing the OCL constructs and semantics. We evaluated Pi-CD by configuring 20 CPS products of varying complexity from two real-world CPS product lines. Results show that Pi-CD can achieve up to 72% automation degree with a negligible time cost. Moreover, its time performance remains stable with the increase in the number of configuration parameters as well as constraints.},

Regarding the software industry, this, roughly presents both a manufacturing and mass production that generates products that are denoted as individual software and standard software (Pohl et al., 2005): a clear influence of Fordism in the development paradigm of Software Product Lines (SPL). However, this development paradigm was not designed to support user requirements changes at run-time. Faced with this problem, the academy has developed and proposed the Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) (Hallsteinsen et al., 2008) paradigm. Considering this scenario, we objective contribute to DSPL field presenting a new way of thinking which DSPL features should be connected at run-time to a product based on an analysis of quality attributes in service levels specified by the user. In order to validate the proposed approach we tested it on a context-aware DSPL. At the end of the exploratory validation we can observe the effectiveness of the proposed approach in the DSPL which it was applied. However, it is necessary to perform another studies in order to achieve statistical evidences of this effectiveness.},

These specifications along with the stakeholders' configurations and the feature model are transformed into a constraint programming problem, on which decision rules are executed to find a non-conflicting set of solution configurations that are aligned to business objectives. We evaluate CoCo's compositionality and model complexity simplification while using a set of motivating decision scenarios.},

One of the goals of adopting SO is the improvement of reusability, however, the development of service-based system in practice has uncovered several challenging issues, such as how to identify reusable services, how to determine configurations of services that are relevant to users' current product configuration and context, and how to maintain service validity after configuration changes. In this paper, we propose a method that addresses these issues by adapting a feature-oriented product line engineering approach. The method is notable in that it guides developers to identify reusable services at the right level of granularity and to map users' context to relevant service configuration, and it also provides a means to check the validity of services at runtime in terms of invariants and pre/post-conditions of services. Moreover, we propose a heterogeneous style based architecture model for developing such systems.},

The software engineering context of the company is characterized by a two-fold access to the market - core customer driven product enhancement and product development for a broader, anonymous market - and the embedding of software engineering in multi-disciplinary systems and solutions engineering.Based on a characterization of the business, the software product subject to migration towards SPLE, and the goals and background of the SPLE initiative, seven key challenges with respect to the migration are identified. These challenges relate to process diversity in the face of multiple reuse approaches; the management of requirements and variability; the integration of requirements traceability and variability management; legacy software and discipline vs. software-specific modularization; integration with systems engineering; costing and pricing models; and project vs. product documentation.},

abstract = {Need for adaptiveness of business applications is on the rise with continued increase in business dynamics. Ground-up development techniques neither deliver nor can scale in this dynamic situation. Software Product Line Engineering (SPLE) aims to increase adaptiveness by capturing commonality and variability up front to suitably configure the application from its parts. Code-centric SPLE techniques show unacceptable responsiveness when business applications are subjected to changes along multiple simultaneously evolving dimensions. Using clear separation of functional concerns from implementation platform, model driven approaches enable easy delivery of the same functionality into multiple technology platforms. However, business applications exhibit variability in several dimensions such as functionality, business process, design decisions, architecture, and technology platform. We argue that SPLE techniques need to be elevated to a higher level of abstraction to enable them to work in unison with model-driven techniques in order to realize the desired adaptiveness along all these dimensions. We have been delivering large business applications using model-driven techniques for past 15 years. In this paper, we have outlined several key challenges that we faced in adopting SPLE and presented tenets of a solution that is likely to have greater acceptance by industry practice.},

Existing PLA modeling approaches are limited in the sense that (1) it is often difficult to relate a product line feature to its implementation in the PLA, and (2) variation points in the PLA have to be manually developed and maintained. In this paper, we present a novel PLA modeling approach and a toolset called ArchFeature that addresses these two challenges. ArchFeature integrates PLA and feature specification in a single monolithic architecture model. It includes a graphical modeling environment that can (1) automatically capture, maintain, and visualize the feature-PLA relationship, (2) encapsulate variability modeling from the user, and (3) support automatic derivation of architecture instances from the PLA. ArchFeature is an Eclipse plugin integrated in ArchStudio, an Eclipse-based architecture development platform. We assessed its usability and effectiveness in a case study by using it to develop a full-featured architecture model for an open-source software system, Apache Solr.},

We propose efficient family-based SPL model checking of modal -calculus formulae on FTSs based on variability parity games, which extend parity games with conditional edges labelled with feature configurations, by reducing the SPL model checking problem for the modal -calculus on FTSs to the variability parity game solving problem, based on an encoding of FTSs as variability parity games. We validate our contribution by experiments on SPL benchmark models, which demonstrate that a novel family-based algorithm to collectively solve variability parity games, using symbolic representations of the configuration sets, outperforms the product-based method of solving the standard parity games obtained by projection with classical algorithms.},

abstract = {Modern software systems are highly configurable in order to satisfy diverse customer requirements and application contexts. Feature models provide a well-established formalism for tailoring configuration spaces of applications. Thereupon, multi-view staged configuration approaches modularize feature models for separation of concerns and apply workflow modeling for scheduling configuration decisions. However, the complex, often oblivious and even cyclic logical dependencies among configuration decisions obstruct compositional semantics of feature model views thus spoiling intuitive modeling and rigorous analysis of staged configuration processes. In this paper, we apply workflow Petri nets (WPNs) as a formal operational model for staged configuration that makes explicit causal dependencies among feature selections. For the internal separation into composable configuration stages we further adopt the principles of open workflow nets. It is shown that the soundness notion of WPNs naturally coincides with fundamental correctness and liveness properties to be verified for staged configuration processes. We present a prototype implementation for an automated computation of staged configuration processes and provide experimental results concerning scalability properties.},

We previously envisioned a way of allowing inconsistencies during product configuration and in this paper we present a solution on how to realize this vision. We introduce HUMUS (High-level Union of Minimal Unsatisfiable Sets), which enables correct reasoning in product line engineering (encoded in SAT) despite the presence of errors. We focus mainly on tolerating inconsistencies during product configuration, to make it possible to resolve inconsistencies later without misguiding the human user along the way. We also provide a discussion of other applications in product line engineering and beyond. The main advantage of using HUMUS is, that it is possible to isolate erroneous parts of a product line model such that existing automations continue to be useful. The applications of HUMUS are thus likely beyond product line engineering.},

abstract = {In the context of Software Product Lines (SPLs), evaluating the quality of a feature model is essential to ensure that errors in the early stages do not spread throughout the SPL. One way to evaluate a feature model is to use measures. However, measures alone are not enough to characterize the feature model quality, because most of them cover specific aspects, such as the number of features. So, there is a need for methods to aggregate measures at the level of quality sub-characteristic or characteristic. In this paper, we aim to investigate how to aggregate measures that have been proposed to evaluate the quality of feature models in SPL. We have used the fuzzy logic theory in order to aggregate these measures. The new aggregated measures can be applied to evaluate different and complex aspects of a feature model, such as: size, stability, flexibility and dynamicity. Moreover, to evaluate the use of the new aggregate measures, we applied them in different feature models. Our findings suggest that aggregate measures can assist the domain engineer in evaluating the maintainability of feature models.},

abstract = {In Model-Driven SPL approaches, the derivation of a product starts from a domain application model. This model is transformed using model transformations, which are selected according to variants included in configurations, until a product is obtained. There are at least two drawbacks to these approaches. First, the selection of variants affects the whole domain application model, impeding fine-grained configurations, i.e. configurations at the level of each element in the model, and second, model transformations are coupled with variants which make their maintenance and adaptation difficult. We present an approach that uses meta-modeling and feature modeling. A novelty in our approach is the possibility of configuring a product from a domain application model in which elements can be bound separately to features. These fine-grained configurations are an input to the derivation process which uses decision models and Aspect-Oriented Programming, facilitating the reuse, adaptation and composition of model transformations.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of systems that share common assets allowing a disciplined reuse. Rarely SPLs start from scratch, instead they usually start from a set of existing systems that undergo a reengineering process. Many approaches to conduct the reengineering process have been proposed and documented in research literature. This scenario is a clear testament to the interest in this research area. We conducted a systematic mapping study to provide an overview of the current research on reengineering of existing systems to SPLs, identify the community activity in regarding of venues and frequency of publications in this field, and point out trends and open issues that could serve as references for future research. This study identified 119 relevant publications. These primary sources were classified in six different dimensions related to reengineering phases, strategies applied, types of systems used in the evaluation, input artefacts, output artefacts, and tool support. The analysis of the results points out the existence of a consolidate community on this topic and a wide range of strategies to deal with different phases and tasks of the reengineering process, besides the availability of some tools. We identify some open issues and areas for future research such as the implementation of automation and tool support, the use of different sources of information, need for improvements in the feature management, the definition of ways to combine different strategies and methods, lack of sophisticated refactoring, need for new metrics and measures and more robust empirical evaluation. Reengineering of existing systems into SPLs is an active research topic with real benefits in practice. This mapping study motivates new research in this field as well as the adoption of systematic reuse in software companies.},

Variability models, however, and more specifically those including numerical features (i.e., NVMs), do not natively support QAs, and consequently, neither do automated reasoners commonly used for variability resolution. However, those satisfiability and optimisation problems have been covered and refined in other relational models such as databases.Category Theory (CT) is an abstract mathematical theory typically used to capture the common aspects of seemingly dissimilar algebraic structures. We propose a unified relational modelling framework subsuming the structured objects of VMs and QAs and their relationships into algebraic categories. This abstraction allows a combination of automated reasoners over different domains to analyse SPLs. The solutions’ optimisation can now be natively performed by a combination of automated theorem proving, hashing, balanced-trees and chasing algorithms. We validate this approach by means of the edge computing SPL tool HADAS.},

The overall fault management capabilities should be supported by the composition of those languages. A high-level definition of the language is presented.

Although existing studies have explored the design and evolution of product lines using techniques such as source-code preprocessing and AOP, little is known about the practical implications of using DOP to bootstrap and evolve software product lines. In this paper we address this issue, reporting our experience of using DeltaJ to implement two product lines (Reminder-PL and Iris-PL). This experience covers different scenarios of evolution (such as the inclusion of mandatory, optional, and alternative features) that indeed led to several feature interactions. Altogether, this work brings several contributions, including evidence that existing templates for safe and partially safe evolution of product lines can also help developers to evolve delta-oriented SPLs—although we revealed the need for two additional templates for safe evolution. Also, we present a description of the feature interactions that appeared during the evolution of both product lines and how we modularized these interactions using DOP constructs.},

abstract = {In software product line engineering (SPLE), feature modeling has been extensively used to represent commonality and variability between the products of a domain in terms of features, based on which reusable components are developed. However, the link between a feature model and product requirements, that fundamentally decide how the features are developed into reusable components, has not been adequately addressed in SPLE methods. This paper introduces an approach to combining feature modeling and problem frames in an attempt to address this problem. First, features are mapped to problem frames using heuristics derived from feature modeling and feature mapping units. Requirements are then identified and analyzed to ensure that they are fully satisfied. Finally, a solution modeling method maps the problem frames to architectural components.

abstract = {We compare two ontology-based feature modeling styles by conducting an experiment.The results show that ontology factor has statistical significance in all metrics.The results show that the ontology based on instances is more flexible.The results show that the ontology based on instances demands less time to change. A software product line (SPL) is a set of software systems that have a particular set of common features and that satisfy the needs of a particular market segment or mission. Feature modeling is one of the key activities involved in the design of SPLs. The feature diagram produced in this activity captures the commonalities and variabilities of SPLs. In some complex domains (e.g., ubiquitous computing, autonomic systems and context-aware computing), it is difficult to foresee all functionalities and variabilities a specific SPL may require. Thus, Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPLs) bind variation points at runtime to adapt to fluctuations in user needs as well as to adapt to changes in the environment. In this context, relying on formal representations of feature models is important to allow them to be automatically analyzed during system execution. Among the mechanisms used for representing and analyzing feature models, description logic (DL) based approaches demand to be better investigated in DSPLs since it provides capabilities, such as automated inconsistency detection, reasoning efficiency, scalability and expressivity. Ontology is the most common way to represent feature models knowledge based on DL reasoners. Previous works conceived ontologies for feature modeling either based on OWL classes and properties or based on OWL individuals. However, considering change or evolution scenarios of feature models, we need to compare whether a class-based or an individual-based feature modeling style is recommended to describe feature models to support SPLs, and especially its capabilities to deal with changes in feature models, as required by DSPLs. In this paper, we conduct a controlled experiment to empirically compare two approaches based on each one of these modeling styles in several changing scenarios (e.g., add/remove mandatory feature, add/remove optional feature and so on). We measure time to perform changes, structural impact of changes (flexibility) and correctness for performing changes in our experiment. Our results indicate that using OWL individuals requires less time to change and is more flexible than using OWL classes and properties. These results provide insightful assumptions towards the definition of an approach relying on reasoning capabilities of ontologies that can effectively support products reconfiguration in the context of DSPL.},

abstract = {Context: Variability management is a key activity in software product line engineering. This paper focuses on managing rationale information during the decision-making activities that arise during variability management. By decision-making we refer to systematic problem solving by considering and evaluating various alternatives. Rationale management is a branch of science that enables decision-making based on the argumentation of stakeholders while capturing the reasons and justifications behind these decisions. Objective: Decision-making should be supported to identify variability in domain engineering and to resolve variation points in application engineering. We capture the rationale behind variability management decisions. The captured rationale information is useful to evaluate future changes of variability models as well as to handle future instantiations of variation points. We claim that maintaining rationale will enhance the longevity of variability models. Furthermore, decisions should be performed using a formal communication between domain engineering and application engineering. Method: We initiate the novel area of issue-based variability management (IVM) by extending variability management with rationale management. The key contributions of this paper are: (i) an issue-based variability management methodology (IVMM), which combines questions, options and criteria (QOC) and a specific variability approach; (ii) a meta-model for IVMM and a process for variability management and (iii) a tool for the methodology, which was developed by extending an open source rationale management tool. Results: Rationale approaches (e.g. questions, options and criteria) guide distributed stakeholders when selecting choices for instantiating variation points. Similarly, rationale approaches also aid the elicitation of variability and the evaluation of changes. The rationale captured within the decision-making process can be reused to perform future decisions on variability. Conclusion: IVMM was evaluated comparatively based on an experimental survey, which provided evidence that IVMM is more effective than a variability modeling approach that does not use issues.},

abstract = {The concept of variability is fundamental in software product lines and a successful implementation of a product line largely depends on how well domain requirements and their variability are specified, managed, and realized. While developing an educational software product line, we identified a lack of support to specify variability in quality concerns. To address this problem we propose an approach to model variability in quality concerns, which is an extension of quality attribute scenarios. In particular, we propose domain quality attribute scenarios, which extend standard quality attribute scenarios with additional information to support specification of variability and deriving product specific scenarios. We demonstrate the approach with scenarios for robustness and upgradability requirements in the educational software product line.},

abstract = {This work states that there is a need for an optimized problem space representation for heterogeneous domains. We identify two modeling paradigms widely used in practice: Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) and Feature-Oriented Domain Modeling (FODM). Each modeling paradigm favors different domain characteristics. Especially the fact that software often is embedded either in a system or in a process and, therefore, is strongly influenced by its environment enforces the demand for a combined representation.We propose a concept for a multi-modeling approach based on existing technology. Multi-modeling means the combination of the two main modeling paradigms to represent a heterogeneous domain. The major benefit of the approach is the reduction of representation complexity by optimizing the representation of single subdomains. This will be shown on one representative case study from the automotive domain. Another advantage is the improved stakeholder communication because of familiar notations. A discussion of limitations shows potential for future work.},

abstract = {ContextA Software Product Line (SPL) is a set of software systems that share common functionalities, so-called features. When features are related, we consider this relation a feature dependency. Whenever a new feature is added, the presence of feature dependencies in the source code may increase the maintenance effort. In particular, along the maintenance of SPL implementation, added features may induce changes in other features, the so-called change propagation. Change propagation is the set of ripple changes required to other features whenever a particular feature is added or changed. ObjectiveThe relationship between feature dependency and change propagation is not well understood. Therefore, the objective of our study is to examine the relation between feature dependency and change propagation. MethodWe investigate change propagation through feature dependencies in additive changes on five evolving SPLs. We analysed a wide range of additive changes in 21 representations of those SPLs. This analysis enabled us to understand whether and how features dependencies and change propagations are related. ResultsThe results have empirically confirmed for the first time the strong relation between feature dependency and change propagation. We also identified what are the circumstances involving dependent features that are more likely to cause change propagation. Surprisingly, the results also suggested that the extent of change propagation across SPL features might be higher than the one found in previous studies of dependent modules in non-SPLs. We also found a concentration of change propagation in a few feature dependencies. ConclusionEven though the results show that there is a strong relation between feature dependencies and change propagation, such relation is not alike for all dependencies. This indicates that (i) a general feature dependency minimisation might not ameliorate the change propagation, and (ii) feature dependency properties must be analysed beforehand to drive maintenance effort to important dependencies.},

Currently developed CBTC platforms are actually very complex systems including several functionalities, and every installed system, developed by a different company, varies in extent, scope, number, and even names of the implemented functionalities. International standards have emerged, but they remain at a quite abstract level, mostly setting terminology. This paper presents the results of an experience in defining a global model of CBTC, by mixing semi-formal modelling and product line engineering. The effort has been based on an in-depth market analysis, not limiting to particular aspects but considering as far as possible the whole picture. The paper also describes a methodology to derive novel CBTC products from the global model, and to define system requirements for the individual CBTC components. To this end, the proposed methodology employs scenario-based requirements elicitation aided with rapid prototyping. To enhance the quality of the requirements, these are written in a constrained natural language (CNL), and evaluated with natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The final goal is to go toward a formal representation of the requirements for CBTC systems. The overall approach is discussed, and the current experience with the implementation of the method is presented. In particular, we show how the presented methodology has been used in practice to derive a novel CBTC architecture.},

abstract = {ContextVerification techniques are being applied to ensure that software systems achieve desired quality levels and fulfill functional and non-functional requirements. However, applying these techniques to software product lines is challenging, given the exponential blowup of the number of products. Current product-line verification techniques leverage symbolic model checking and variability information to optimize the analysis, but still face limitations that make them costly or infeasible. In particular, state-of-the-art verification techniques for product-line reliability analysis are enumerative which hinders their applicability, given the latent exponential blowup of the configuration space. ObjectiveThe objectives of this paper are the following: (a) we present a method to efficiently compute the reliability of all configurations of a compositional or annotation-based software product line from its UML behavioral models, (b) we provide a tool that implements the proposed method, and (c) we report on an empirical study comparing the performance of different reliability analysis strategies for software product lines. MethodWe present a novel feature-family-based analysis strategy to compute the reliability of all products of a (compositional or annotation-based) software product line. The feature-based step of our strategy divides the behavioral models into smaller units that can be analyzed more efficiently. The family-based step performs the reliability computation for all configurations at once by evaluating reliability expressions in terms of a suitable variational data structure. ResultsOur empirical results show that our feature-family-based strategy for reliability analysis outperforms, in terms of time and space, four state-of-the-art strategies (product-based, family-based, feature-product-based, and family-product-based) for the same property. It is the only one that could be scaled to a 220-fold increase in the size of the configuration space. ConclusionOur feature-family-based strategy leverages both feature- and family-based strategies by taming the size of the models to be analyzed and by avoiding the products enumeration inherent to some state-of-the-art analysis methods.},

As a consequence of the increasing number of Web services on the Internet and its important role in many applications today, Web service quality has become a crucial requirement and demanded by service consumers. Terms of quality levels are written between service providers and service consumers to ensure a degree of quality. The use of monitoring tools to control service quality levels is very important. Quality attributes suffer variations in their values during runtime, this is produced by many factors such as a memory leak, deadlock, race data, inconsistent data, etc. However, sometimes monitoring tools can impact negatively affecting the quality of service when they are not properly used and configured, producing possible conflicts between quality attributes. This paper aims to show the impact of monitoring tools over service quality, two of the most important quality attributes - performance and accuracy - were chosen to be monitored. A case study is conducted to present and evaluate the relationship between performance and accuracy over a Web service. As a result, conflict is found between performance and accuracy, where performance was the most affected, because it presented a degradation in its quality level during monitoring.},

abstract = {With the advent of model-driven engineering, software product line (SPL) technologies must be able to generate models as instances of a model-based SPL (MBSPL). Delta modeling is a variability mechanism which can be easily adopted for MBSPLs. The idea is to generate products by applying one or several deltas onto a core model. Hence, the main task during SPL implementation is to develop a set of deltas and to maintain several kinds of interrelations, e.g. dependencies and conflicts, in order to be able to generate all products of a MBSPL upon request. The resulting network of deltas is often complex and hard to maintain without appropriate tool support. This paper presents a tool environment for quality assurance in delta-oriented MBSPLs supporting the identification and elimination of design flaws in a network of deltas based on the principles of quality metrics and refactoring. We build upon previous work on the integration of model versioning tools with delta-oriented development of MBSPLs. Our solution is agnostic of the modeling language and may be easily extended by additional quality metrics and refactorings. We illustrate our approach using a delta-oriented MBSPL from the automation domain.},

abstract = {Software variability management deals with the adaptation of reusable artifacts, such as models, specifications, and code, for particular requirements. External variability, which refers to software functionality as visible to users, deserves a special attention as it is closely linked to requirements and hence to early development stages. Errors or inaccuracies in these stages are relatively inexpensive to detect and easy to correct, yet can lead to expensive outcomes if not corrected. Nevertheless, the analysis of external variability in the literature is done ad-hoc and requires improvement.In this paper we introduce a framework for classifying external variability types based on ontological principles. The framework defines the external view of software in terms of the behavior of the application domain. Behavior is formalized as state changes in response to external stimuli. Based on this view we classify the possible similarities and differences among applications and identify an integrated similarity measurement. We demonstrate the usage of this classification framework for feasibility studies in system development.},

abstract = {Feature models are a helpful means to document, manage, maintain, and configure the variability of a software system, and thus are a core artifact in software product-line engineering. Due to the various purposes of feature models, they can be a cross-cutting concern in an organization, integrating technical and business aspects. For this reason, various stakeholders (e.g., developers and consultants) may get involved into modeling the features of a software product line. Currently, collaboration in such a scenario can only be done with face-to-face meetings or by combining single-user feature-model editors with additional communication and version-control systems. While face-to-face meetings are often costly and impractical, using version-control systems can cause merge conflicts and inconsistency within a model, due to the different intentions of the involved stakeholders. Advanced tools that solve these problems by enabling collaborative, real-time feature modeling, analogous to Google Docs or Overleaf for text editing, are missing. In this article, we build on a previous paper and describe (1) the extended formal foundations of collaborative, real-time feature modeling, (2) our conflict resolution algorithm in more detail, (3) proofs that our formalization converges and preserves causality as well as user intentions, (4) the implementation of our prototype, and (5) the results of an empirical evaluation to assess the prototype’s usability. Our contributions provide the basis for advancing existing feature-modeling tools and practices to support collaborative feature modeling. The results of our evaluation show that our prototype is considered helpful and valuable by 17 users, also indicating potential for extending our tool and opportunities for new research directions.},

abstract = {The need for flexible customization of large feature-rich software systems, according to requirements of various stakeholders, has become an important problem in software development. Among the many software engineering approaches dealing with variability management, the notion of Software Product Line (SPL) has emerged as a major unifying concept. Drawing from established disciplines of manufacturing, SPL approaches aim to design repertoires of software artifacts, from which customized software systems for specific stakeholder requirements can be developed. A major difficulty SPL approaches attempt to address is the modularization of software artifacts, which reconciles the user's needs for certain features and the development and technical constraints. Towards this end, many SPL approaches use feature diagrams to describe possible configurations of a feature set. There have been several proposals for feature diagram languages with varying degrees of expressiveness, intuitiveness, and precision. However, these feature diagram languages have limited scalability when applied to realistic software systems. This article provides a systematic survey of various concerns of feature diagrams and ways in which concerns have been separated. The survey shows how the uncertainty in the purpose of feature diagram languages creates both conceptual and practical limitations to scalability of those languages.},

abstract = {Quality evaluation is a challenging task in monolithic software systems. It is even more complex when it comes to Service-Oriented Software Product Lines (SOSPL), as it needs to analyze the attributes of a family of SOA systems. In SOSPL, variability can be planned and managed at the architectural level to develop a software product with the same set of functionalities but different degrees of non-functional quality attribute satisfaction. Therefore, architectural quality evaluation becomes crucial due to the fact that it allows for the examination of whether or not the final product satisfies and guarantees all the ranges of quality requirements within the envisioned scope. This paper addresses the open research problem of aggregating QoS attribute ranges with respect to architectural variability. Previous solutions for quality aggregation do not consider architectural variability for composite services. Our approach introduces variability patterns that can possibly occur at the architectural level of an SOSPL. We propose an aggregation model for QoS computation which takes both variability and composition patterns into account.},

Optimizing product design and the supply chain network at the same time brings substantial benefits. However, this approach involves decisions that can generate uncertainties in the long term. The challenge is to come up with a method that can adapt to most possible environments without straying too far from the optimal solution. Our approach is based on the generation of scenarios that correspond to combinations of uncertain parameters within the model. The performance of designs resulting from these scenario optimizations are compared to the performance of each of the other design scenarios, based on their probability of occurrence. The proposed methodology will allow practitioners to choose a suitable design, from the most profitable to the most reliable.},

The purpose of this study is to support product managers with feature selection for an existing product line. For this purpose, first, the feature model of the product line is encoded into a single binary encoding. Then we employ a bi-criteria genetic search algorithm, NSGA-II, to find the possible alternatives with different value and product integrity. From the proposed set of trade-off alternatives, the product line manager can select the solutions that best fit with the concerns of their preference. The implementation has been initially evaluated by two product line configurations.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) involved variability modeling in domain engineering that will be matched to the respected application engineering. Several researches existed within the scope of mapping from reference architecture (RA) in domain engineering to system architecture in application engineering within the same domain. However, the mapping of cross domain RA or Multi Product Line (MPL) required more systematic mapping due to the several participating product line architecture (PLA) that will further instantiated to specific system architecture. The objective of this paper was to propose an actor-oriented approach in the mapping process of reference architecture, product line architecture and system architecture of MPL. Since the reference architecture consisted of several components, the scope of this research was within the functional decomposition or source code level. The experiment was involving the runtime behavior of the java code. The code with actor-oriented approach had shown the least amount of time taken to complete the main method compared to the non-actor-oriented approach. In conclusion, actor-oriented approach performs better performance in the mapping of reference architecture to product line architecture and system architecture. For future work, the consistency of the mapping will be evaluated.},

It is built in the early stages of SPL development and describes the main features and relationships. The feature model evolves according to the evolution of the SPL. Thus, it is important to build maintainable feature models. In this scenario, measures have been proven useful in the maintainability evaluation of the feature models. This paper presents an exploratory study on the impact of feature models maintainability over the SPL evolution process. In order to support this analysis, we built a dataset containing a compiled set of 21 maintainability structural measures extracted from 16 feature models and respective versions. Although not conclusive, our findings indicate that the feature models maintainability tends to decrease as it evolves. We also identified the most common changes performed in a feature model during its evolution process.},

abstract = {High development and maintenance costs and a high error rate are the major problems in the development of automation systems, which are mainly caused by bad communication and inefficient reuse methods. To overcome these problems, we propose a more systematic reuse approach. Though systematic reuse approaches such as software product lines are appealing, they tend to involve rather burdensome development and management processes. This paper focuses on small enterprises. Since such companies are often unable to perform a "big bang" adoption of the software product line, we suggest an incremental, more lightweight process to transition from single-system development to software product line development. Besides the components of the transition process, this paper discusses tool selection, DSL technology, stakeholder communication support, and business considerations. Although based on problems from the automation system domain, we believe the approach may be general enough to be applicable in other domains as well. The approach has proven successful in two case studies. First, we applied it to a research project for the automation of a logistics lab model, and in the second case (a real-life industry case), we investigated the approaches suitability for fish farm automation systems. Several metrics were collected throughout the evolution of each case, and this paper presents the data for single system development, clone&amp;own and software product line development. The results and observable effects are compared, discussed, and finally summarized in a list of lessons learned.},

ObjectiveIn the context of PLE, providing immediate feedback on the correctness of a manual configuration step to users has a practical impact on whether a configuration process with tool support can be successfully adopted in practice. MethodIn an existing work, a UML-based variability modeling methodology named as SimPL and an interactive configuration process was proposed. Based on the existing work, we propose an automated, incremental and efficient conformance checking approach to ensure that the manual configuration of a variation point conforms to a set of pre-defined conformance rules specified in the Object Constraint Language (OCL). The proposed approach, named as Zen-CC, has been implemented as an integrated part of our product configuration and derivation tool: Zen-Configurator. ResultsThe performance and scalability of Zen-CC have been evaluated with a real-world case study. Results show that Zen-CC significantly outperformed two baseline engines in terms of performance. Besides, the performance of Zen-CC remains stable during the configuration of all the 10 products of the product line and its efficiency also remains un-impacted even with the growing product complexity, which is not the case for both of the baseline engines. ConclusionThe results suggest that Zen-CC performs practically well and is much more scalable than the two baseline engines and is scalable for configuring products with a larger number of variation points.},

This system is required to be applicable in multiple business domains and diverging environments ranging from large scale hospitals to single practitioner clinics.During this effort we were able to extract the common denominator in the form of core assets from existing applications specific to a medical field. For customisations well defined variation points were developed. Our solution allows for easy implementation of medical documentation requirements compared to tedious development of new applications from scratch. It significantly reduced the necessary development effort and time to market. The resulting core documentation platform can be used for an arbitrary medical field completely eliminating the dependence on the specific customer domain.},

To do this, some strategies have been proposed, however, they have not been properly evaluated and compared. In this paper a case study is described comparing three different test strategies: the product by product strategy that tests each product individually; an incremental strategy that tests the products reusing test cases from products previously tested; and a strategy that instantiates test data derived in the domain engineering, considering SPL commonalities and variabilities. In the study an SPL from the games domain was used, and the test data were generated from use cases. The results show that SPL oriented strategies are associated to greater percentages of reuse, and consequently, with lower effort to write test cases.},

The main challenge lies in the increased design variables and constraints, and providing an optimal tradeoff for individual products performance in the family which are competitive with each other. The Concurrent Subspace Optimization for multidisciplinary problem is extended to product family design with predefined platforms. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that the system level owns the ability to catch the global tendency of the true design space and the number of evaluations required is reduced by using surrogate models. Each subspace optimization problem has the freedom to specify the unique variables for one family member, and the system level optimizes the product platform using the surrogate models created based on subspace optimizations. The process is solved in an iterative way, and the improving surrogate models guide the optimization to the global optimal design. Results from a truss family example with small design space confirm the ability and efficiency of the extended Concurrent Subspace Optimization to address product family problem by compared with ATC approach. Then the proposed method is successfully applied to a family of unmanned aircraft wing structures, which is more complicated and related to practical implementation issues.},

abstract = {Handling large-scale software variability is still a challenge for many organizations. After decades of research on variability management concepts, many industrial organizations have introduced techniques known from research, but still lament that pure textbook approaches are not applicable or efficient. For instance, software product line engineering—an approach to systematically develop portfolios of products—is difficult to adopt given the high upfront investments; and even when adopted, organizations are challenged by evolving their complex product lines. Consequently, the research community now mainly focuses on re-engineering and evolution techniques for product lines; yet, understanding the current state of adoption and the industrial challenges for organizations is necessary to conceive effective techniques. In this multiple-case study, we analyze the current adoption of variability management techniques in twelve medium- to large-scale industrial cases in domains such as automotive, aerospace or railway systems. We identify the current state of variability management, emphasizing the techniques and concepts they adopted. We elicit the needs and challenges expressed for these cases, triangulated with results from a literature review. We believe our results help to understand the current state of adoption and shed light on gaps to address in industrial practice.},

The goal is to reveal how a set of independent variables (factors) influences one or more dependent variables. With a vast number of factors or a high amount of factors' values (levels), this process becomes time- and energy-consuming. Current approaches to lower the benchmarking effort suffer from two deficiencies: (1) they focus on reducing the number of factors and, hence, are inapplicable to experiments with only two factors, but a vast number of levels and (2) being adopted from, e.g., combinatorial optimization they are designed for a different search space structure and, thus, can be very wasteful. This paper provides an approach for benchmark reduction, based on adaptive instance selection and multiple linear regression. We evaluate our approach using four empirical studies, which investigate the effect made by dynamic voltage and frequency scaling in combination with dynamic concurrency throttling on the energy consumption of a computing system (parallel compression, sorting, and encryption algorithms as well as database query processing). Our findings show the effectiveness of the approach. We can save 78% of benchmarking effort, while the result's quality decreases only by 3 pp, due to using only a near-optimal configuration.},

abstract = {Today's software systems are too complex to ensure security after the fact – security has to be built into systems by design. To this end, model-based techniques such as UMLsec support the design-time specification and analysis of security requirements by providing custom model annotations and checks. Yet, a particularly challenging type of complexity arises from the variability of software product lines. Analyzing the security of all products separately is generally infeasible. In this work, we propose SecPL, a methodology for ensuring security in a software product line. SecPL allows developers to annotate the system design model with product-line variability and security requirements. To keep the exponentially large configuration space tractable during security checks, SecPL provides a family-based security analysis. In our experiments, this analysis outperforms the naive strategy of checking all products individually. Finally, we present the results of a user study that indicates the usability of our overall methodology.},

We set out an alternate vision for a new kind of software development environment inspired by recent results from Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE). Given an input program that satisfies the functional requirements, the proposed programming environment will automatically generate a set of candidate program implementations, all of which share functionality, but each of which differ in their non-functional trade offs. The software designer navigates this diverse Pareto surface of candidate implementations, gaining insight into the trade offs and selecting solutions for different platforms and environments, thereby stretching beyond the reach of current compiler technologies. Rather than having to focus on the details required to manage complex, inter-related and conflicting, non-functional trade offs, the designer is thus freed to explore, to understand, to control and to decide rather than to construct.},

abstract = {ContextSearch-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is an emerging discipline that focuses on the application of search-based optimization techniques to software engineering problems. Software Product Lines (SPLs) are families of related software systems whose members are distinguished by the set of features each one provides. SPL development practices have proven benefits such as improved software reuse, better customization, and faster time to market. A typical SPL usually involves a large number of systems and features, a fact that makes them attractive for the application of SBSE techniques which are able to tackle problems that involve large search spaces. ObjectiveThe main objective of our work is to identify the quantity and the type of research on the application of SBSE techniques to SPL problems. More concretely, the SBSE techniques that have been used and at what stage of the SPL life cycle, the type of case studies employed and their empirical analysis, and the fora where the research has been published. MethodA systematic mapping study was conducted with five research questions and assessed 77 publications from 2001, when the term SBSE was coined, until 2014. ResultsThe most common application of SBSE techniques found was testing followed by product configuration, with genetic algorithms and multi-objective evolutionary algorithms being the two most commonly used techniques. Our study identified the need to improve the robustness of the empirical evaluation of existing research, a lack of extensive and robust tool support, and multiple avenues worthy of further investigation. ConclusionsOur study attested the great synergy existing between both fields, corroborated the increasing and ongoing interest in research on the subject, and revealed challenging open research questions.},

abstract = {The increasing complexity and cost of software-intensive systems has led developers to seek ways of reusing software components across development projects. One approach to increasing software reusability is to develop a software product-line (SPL), which is a software architecture that can be reconfigured and reused across projects. Rather than developing software from scratch for a new project, a new configuration of the SPL is produced. It is hard, however, to find a configuration of an SPL that meets an arbitrary requirement set and does not violate any configuration constraints in the SPL. Existing research has focused on techniques that produce a configuration of an SPL in a single step. Budgetary constraints or other restrictions, however, may require multi-step configuration processes. For example, an aircraft manufacturer may want to produce a series of configurations of a plane over a span of years without exceeding a yearly budget to add features. This paper provides three contributions to the study of multi-step configuration for SPLs. First, we present a formal model of multi-step SPL configuration and map this model to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Second, we show how solutions to these SPL configuration problems can be automatically derived with a constraint solver by mapping them to CSPs. Moreover, we show how feature model changes can be mapped to our approach in a multi-step scenario by using feature model drift. Third, we present empirical results demonstrating that our CSP-based reasoning technique can scale to SPL models with hundreds of features and multiple configuration steps.},

A software product line is a set of software systems that share a common, managed set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment. The literature reports various software metrics for software product lines developed using object-oriented and aspect-oriented programming. However, after a literature review, we observed that we lack the definition of FOP-specific metrics. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a set of eight novel metrics for feature-oriented programming. These metrics were derived both from our experience in FOP and from existing software metrics. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed metrics by applying them to a software product line.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are a common technique to capture families of software products in terms of commonalities and variabilities. On a conceptual level, functionality of an SPL is modeled in terms of features in Feature Models (FMs). As other software systems, SPLs and their FMs are subject to evolution that may lead to the introduction of anomalies (e.g., non-selectable features). To fix such anomalies, developers need to understand the cause for them. However, for large evolution histories and large SPLs, explanations may become very long and, as a consequence, hard to understand. In this paper, we present a method for anomaly detection and explanation that, by encoding the entire evolution history, identifies the evolution step of anomaly introduction and explains which of the performed evolution operations lead to it. In our evaluation, we show that our method significantly reduces the complexity of generated explanations.},

Complex scenarios typically involve the execution of several transformations that, due to variability of solutions to develop software projects, need to be tailored to attempt different implementation technologies, libraries, patterns, etc. Recent proposals to tailor these assets suggested that current Software Product Line (SPL) techniques can be used to promote reuse of model transformation assets. However, in a recent case study, we have found lacks in techniques, including ours, to apply reuse for this domain in particular. Thus, this paper presents this case study and discusses implications and challenges in tailoring these assets with SPL techniques.},

Typical automation activities in this context include automated configuration value inference, optimizing configuration steps and consistency checking. However, to this end, relevant constraints have to be well-specified and characterized in the way such that automated configuration can be enabled. In this paper, we classify and characterize constraints that are required to be specified to support most of the key functionalities of any automated product configuration solution, based on our experience of studying three industrial product lines.},

In such a context, considering that numerous clustering possibilities exist, this paper presents a quantitative, evidence-based approach for recommending software modules by clustering software components. The proposed approach has a threefold foundation: quantitative measures that characterize dependencies between components; a search-based clustering algorithm to recommend modules; and a quantitative measure that characterize dependencies between modules, which can guide the allocation of development teams to modules.},

abstract = {Software Product Line Engineering concerns itself with domain engineering and application engineering. During domain engineering, the whole product family is modeled with a preferred flavor of feature models and additional models as required (e.g., domain models or scenario-based models). During application engineering, the focus shifts toward a single family member and the configuration of the member's features. Recently, aspectual concepts have been employed to better encapsulate individual features of a Software Product Line (SPL), but the existing body of SPL work does not include a unified reasoning framework that integrates aspect-oriented feature description artifacts with the capability to reason about stakeholders' goals while taking feature interactions into consideration. Goal-oriented SPL approaches have been proposed, but do not provide analysis capabilities that help modelers meet the needs of the numerous stakeholders involved in an SPL while at the same time considering feature interactions. We present an aspect-oriented SPL approach for the requirements phase that allows modelers (a) to capture features, goals, and scenarios in a unified framework and (b) to reason about stakeholders' needs and perform trade-off analyses while considering undesirable interactions that are not obvious from the feature model. The approach is based on the Aspect-oriented User Requirements Notation (AoURN) and helps identify, prioritize, and choose products based on analysis results provided by AoURN editor and analysis tools. We apply the AoURN-based SPL framework to the Via Verde SPL to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach through the selection of a Via Verde product configuration that satisfies stakeholders' needs and results in a high-level, scenario-based specification that is free from undesirable feature interactions.},

abstract = {Software Product Line, SPL, is a software development strategy in which products are developed from a common set of core assets in a prescribed way with product specific features to satisfy specific market segment [1]. The SPL development process is carried out in two phases: the first phase is about building core assets called domain engineering, which has gained a lot of researchers' attention. The second step is about instantiating the specifics of the products by adding to the common part the specific features that identify the product from the other application engineering. For large and complex domains, it is argued that organizing and retrieving the development of artifacts from the core asset required by the application under development is a way of shortening the application development time, thus reduces the time to market. In this paper, we propose an automation mechanism for organizing the core assets using feature based organization to divide the customized domain feature model based on the application features and their dependencies. When that retrieval step where the artifacts are represented by relations that inherit the dependencies between the features in each division of the feature model, takes place, the final result is a set of development artifacts with their traceability links to be customized based on the application variability model and integrated with the application specific artifacts. To demonstrate our work, we applied this mechanism on a watch, a case study in the digital watch domain.},

abstract = {Industries that successfully apply product line approaches often operate in markets that are well established and have a strategic perspective. Consequently, such organizations have a tendency towards long-term planning of products and product lines. Although there are numerous approaches for efficient product line engineering, there is surprisingly little support for a long-term, strategic perspective and an evolution of product lines. To address these challenges, we aim to integrate evolution into model-driven product line engineering. In particular, we explore how feature models can be applied to describe the evolution of product lines. The paper contributes (i) concepts for describing the evolution of product lines with feature models, (ii) a corresponding framework, which puts this into a bigger context and (iii) three scenarios that show how this framework can be applied. The concepts are motivated with examples from automotive software engineering and embedded systems, which are industries with a strong affinity to product lines, where long term planning of the product portfolio are common strategies.},

We aim to (1) explore links to such disciplines, (2) systematise and compare concepts, and (3) identify opportunities, where SPLE approaches can be enriched.Method. We undertake an exploratory study: Starting from common SPLE activities and artefacts, we identify aspects where we expect to find corresponding counterparts in other disciplines. We focus on Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), Multi-Objective Optimisation (MOO), and Design Space Exploration (DSE), and perform a comparison of the key concepts.Results. The resulting comparison relates SPLE activities and artefacts to concepts from MCDA, MOO, and DSE and identifies areas where SPLE approaches can be enriched. We also provide examples of existing work at the intersections of SPLE with the other fields. These findings are aimed to foster the conversation on research opportunities where SPLE can draw techniques from other disciplines dealing with complex decision scenarios.},

Feature modeling plays a key role in customization. Empirical evidence through industry application, and in particular methodological guidance of how to structure automotive product lines and their feature models is needed. The overall aim of this work is to provide guidance to practitioners how to structure automotive product lines and their feature models, understanding strengths and weaknesses of alternative structures. The research was conducted in three phases. In the first phase, the context situation was understood using interviews and workshops. In the second phase, possible structures of product lines and feature models were evaluated based on industry feedback collected in workshops. In the third phase, the structures were implemented in the tool GEARS and practitioner feedback was collected. One key challenge was the unavailability of structuring guidelines, which was the focus of this research. The structures considered most suitable for the automotive product line were multiple product lines with modular decomposition. The structures most suitable for the feature model were functional decomposition, using context variability, models corresponding to assets, and feature categories. Other structures have been discarded, and the rationales have been presented. It was possible to support the most suitable structures with the commercial tool GEARS. The implementation in GEARS and the feedback from the practitioners provide early indications for the potential usefulness of the structures and the tool implementation.},

abstract = {Software product line (SPL) engineering is a recent approach to software development where a set of software products are derived for a well defined target application domain, from a common set of core assets using analogous means of production (for instance, through Model Driven Engineering). Therefore, such family of products are built from reuse, instead of developed individually from scratch. SPL promise to lower the costs of development, increase the quality of software, give clients more flexibility and reduce time to market. These benefits come with a set of new problems and turn some older problems possibly more complex. One of these problems is traceability management. In the European AMPLE project we are creating a common traceability framework across the various activities of the SPL development. We identified four orthogonal traceability dimensions in SPL development, one of which is an extension of what is often considered as "traceability of variability". This constitutes one of the two contributions of this paper. The second contribution is the specification of a metamodel for a repository of traceability links in the context of SPL and the implementation of a respective traceability framework.

abstract = {Software architectures are the key to achieving the non-functional requirements NFRs in any software project. In software product line SPL development, it is crucial to identify whether the NFRs for a specific product can be attained with the built-in architectural variation mechanisms of the product line architecture, or whether additional architectural transformations are required. This paper presents a multimodel approach for quality-driven product architecture derivation and improvement QuaDAI. A controlled experiment is also presented with the objective of comparing the effectiveness, efficiency, perceived ease of use, intention to use and perceived usefulness with regard to participants using QuaDAI as opposed to the Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method ATAM. The results show that QuaDAI is more efficient and perceived as easier to use than ATAM, from the perspective of novice software architecture evaluators. However, the other variables were not found to be statistically significant. Further replications are needed to obtain more conclusive results.},

abstract = {Privacy-enhancing personalized (PEP) systems address individual users' privacy preferences as well as privacy laws and regulations. Building such systems entails modeling two different domains: (a) privacy constraints as mandated by law, voluntary self-regulation, or users' individual privacy preferences, and modeled by legal professionals, and (b) software architectures as dictated by available software components and modeled by software architects. Both can evolve independently, e.g., as new laws go into effect or new components become available. In prior work, we proposed modeling PEP systems using a product line architecture (PLA). However, with an extensional PLA, these domain models became strongly entangled making it difficult to modify one without inadvertently affecting the other. This paper evaluates an approach towards modeling both domains within an intensional PLA. We find evidence that this results in a clearer separation between the two domain models, making each easier to evolve and maintain.},

This raises new challenges that the traditional development approaches cannot always provide a complete solution in an efficient way. However, most of the current proposals for automatic generation are not devised to cope with rapid integration of the changes in the business requirement of end user (stakeholders and customers) resource. Domain-specific Rules constitute a key element for domain specific enterprise application, allowing configuration of changes, and management of the domain constraint within a domain. In this paper, we propose an approach to the development of an automatic generation of the domain-specific rules by using variability feature model and ontology definition of domain model concepts coming from Software product line engineering and Model Driven Architecture.

abstract = {Dashboards are useful tools for generating knowledge and support decision-making processes, but the extended use of technologies and the increasingly available data asks for user-friendly tools that allow any user profile to exploit their data. Building tailored dashboards for any potential user profile would involve several resources and long development times, taking into account that dashboards can be framed in very different contexts that should be studied during the design processes to provide practical tools. This situation leads to the necessity of searching for methodologies that could accelerate these processes. The software product line paradigm is one recurrent method that can decrease the time-to-market of products by reusing generic core assets that can be tuned or configured to meet specific requirements. However, although this paradigm can solve issues regarding development times, the configuration of the dashboard is still a complex challenge; users’ goals, datasets, and context must be thoroughly studied to obtain a dashboard that fulfills the users’ necessities and that fosters insight delivery. This paper outlines the benefits and a potential approach to automatically configuring information dashboards by leveraging domain commonalities and code templates. The main goal is to test the functionality of a workflow that can connect external algorithms, such as artificial intelligence algorithms, to infer dashboard features and feed a generator based on the software product line paradigm.},

abstract = {Configurable software systems are software systems that can be adapted or configured according to a set of features with the goal of increasing reuse and productivity. However, testing configurable systems is very challenging due to the number of configurations to run with each test, leading to a combinatorial explosion in the number of configurations and tests. Currently, several testing techniques and tools have been proposed to deal with this challenge, but their potential practical application remains mostly unexplored. The lack of studies to explore the tools that apply those techniques motivated us to investigate the literature to find testing tools for configurable software systems and to understand how they work. In this paper, we conducted a systematic mapping and identified 34 testing tools for configurable software systems. We first summarized and discussed their main characteristics. We then designed and performed a comparative empirical study of the main sound testing tools found: VarexJ and SPLat. They are considered sound testing techniques because they explore all reachable configurations from a given test. Overall, we observed that VarexJ and SPLat presented distinct results for efficiency while testing the target systems and that, although VarexJ found more errors than SPLat for the majority of the target systems, such result deserves a more in-depth investigation because we expected a higher intersection of errors encountered by them.},

Deriving products from a Feature Model (FM) for testing Software Product Lines (SPLs) is a hard task. It is important to select a minimum number of products but, at the same time, to consider the coverage of testing criteria such as pairwise, among other factors. To solve such problems Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) have been successfully applied. However, to design a solution for this and other software engineering problems can be very difficult, because it is necessary to choose among different search operators and parameters. Hyper-heuristics can help in this task, and have raised interest in the Search-Based Software Engineering (SBSE) field. Considering the growing adoption of SPL in the industry and crescent demand for SPL testing approaches, this paper introduces a hyper-heuristic approach to automatically derive products to variability testing of SPLs. The approach works with MOEAs and two selection methods, random and based on FRR-MAB (Fitness Rate Rank based Multi-Armed Bandit). It was evaluated with real FMs and the results show that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional algorithms used in the literature, and that both selection methods present similar performance.},

abstract = {Product family planning is important for mass customization. All the products in a product family are actually transformed from a common product, which is referred to as baseline-product in this study. In this paper, we propose a heuristic method for the baseline-product design within a product family. The proposed heuristic method is based on the genetic algorithm (GA). In contrast to the existing methods for product family planning that need users to specify baseline-product prior to optimize it, the new GA-based method proposed by this paper focuses on searching a proper balance between the commonality of baseline-product and the performance of product family derived from the baseline-product. The method improves as more commonality of the baseline-product as possible, within the satisfactory of the diverse customer needs, and then determines the variable product attributes and their variation ranges, and the common parameters of the baseline-product and their optimal values. This method of baseline-product design is validated by a case study of the small-size induction motor design. At last we compare the results from our GA-based method with the benchmark products that are individually designed to the optimal performance.},

abstract = {Product line engineering is a recent approach to software development that has shown to enable organizations to achieve significant reductions in development and maintenance cost as well as time-to-market of increasingly complex software systems. Yet, the testing process has not kept up with these reductions and the relative cost for testing product lines is actually becoming higher than in traditional single system development. Also, testing often cannot keep pace with accelerated development in product line engineering due to technical and organizational issues. This paper advocates that testing of product lines can be made more efficient and effective by considering testability already during architectural design. It explores the relationship between testability and product line architecture and discusses the importance of high testability for reducing product line testing effort and achieving required coverage criteria. The paper also outlines a systematic approach that will support product line organizations in improving and evaluating testability of product lines at the architectural level.},

abstract = {When designing, constructing, and maintaining diverse and variable software systems, a key challenge is the complexity of systems. A potential approach to tackle this challenge are techniques from variability management and product line engineering to handle the diversity and variability. A key asset in variability management is a variability model, which explicitly specifies the commonalities and variability of a system and the constraints between variants. However, handling variability and configurations remains a challenge due to the complexity on a cognitive level as human engineers reach their limits in identifying, understanding, and using all relevant details. In this paper we address this issue by providing concepts for interactive visual tool support for the configuration of systems with the help of feature models. We discuss relevant principles from the area of information visualization and their application to the domain of feature model configuration. We discuss techniques for interactive configuration support based on a reasoning engine, which, e.g., ensures the validity of configurations. We illustrate our findings by a concrete tool solution called S2T2 Configurator.},

We explored variability in the user interface, input devices, output devices, CPU, as well as other variability in various video game platforms. Then, we designed a variable component-based SPL that is tailored to every video game in the product line. We validated our approach by implementing a SPL of a combat flight-simulator game and by deriving two versions of the game: a Windows desktop version and a Windows Phone version. The derivation process of each version is done by selecting features from the feature dependency model and the corresponding software components and SPL parameters that relate to those features.},

Only few aim to handle SPL evolution, but even those lack support of variability reverse engineering, which is necessary for migrating product copies to a product line. In this paper, we present our continued concept on using component architecture information to enhance a variability reverse engineering process.

In this paper, we present an approach which will improve the efficiency and quality of product configuration.},

abstract = {Software product lines engineering is a viable way to achieve the productivity gains desired by companies. Product line architecture must benefit from commonalities among products in the family and enable the variability among them. The aspect of variability in quality attributes has been neglected or ignored by most of the researchers as attention has been mainly put in functional variability. This paper describes an architecture and design process for software product lines that can properly deal with quality attribute variability. The proposed approach enhances the RiPLE-DE process for software product line engineering with activities and guidelines for quality attribute variability. An initial experimental study is presented to characterize and evaluate the proposed process enhancements.},

abstract = {Software product lines are increasingly built using components from specialized suppliers. A company that is in the middle of a supply chain has to integrate components from its suppliers and offer (partially configured) products to its customers. To satisfy both the variability required by each customer and the variability required to satisfy different customers' needs, it may be necessary for such a company to use components from different suppliers, partly offering the same feature set. This leads to a product line with alternative components, possibly using different mechanisms for interfacing, binding and variability, which commonly occurs in embedded software development. In this paper, we describe the limitations of the current practice of combining heterogeneous components in a product line and describe the challenges that arise from software supply chains. We introduce a model-driven approach for automating the integration between components that can generate a partially or fully configured variant, including glue between mismatched components. We analyze the consequences of using this approach in an industrial context, using a case study derived from an existing supply chain and describe the process and roles associated with this approach.},

abstract = {Context: Integrated control systems (ICSs) are heterogeneous systems where software and hardware components are integrated to control and monitor physical devices and processes. A family of ICSs share the same software code base, which is configured differently for each product to form a unique installation. Due to the complexity of ICSs and inadequate automation support, product configuration in this context is typically error-prone and costly. Objective: As a first step to overcome these challenges, we propose a UML-based product-line modeling methodology that provides a foundation for semi-automated product configuration in the specific context of ICSs. Method: We performed a comprehensive domain analysis to identify characteristics of ICS families, and their configuration challenges. Based on this, we formulated the characteristics of an adequate configuration solution, and derived from them a set of modeling requirements for a model-based solution to configuration. The SimPL methodology is proposed to fulfill these requirements. Results: To evaluate the ability of SimPL to fulfill the modeling requirements, we applied it to a large-scale industrial case study. Our experience with the case study shows that SimPL is adequate to provide a model of the product family that meets the modeling requirements. Further evaluation is still required to assess the applicability and scalability of SimPL in practice. Doing this requires conducting field studies with human subjects and is left for future work. Conclusion: We conclude that configuration in ICSs requires better automation support, and UML-based approaches to product family modeling can be tailored to provide the required foundation.},

abstract = {A self-adaptive service can maintain its QoS requirements in the presence of dynamic environment changes. To develop a self-adaptive service, service engineers have to create self-adaptation logic encoding when the service should execute which adaptation actions. However, developing self-adaptation logic may be difficult due to design time uncertainty; e.g., anticipating all potential environment changes at design time is in most cases infeasible. Online reinforcement learning addresses design time uncertainty by learning suitable adaptation actions through interactions with the environment at runtime. To learn more about its environment, reinforcement learning has to select actions that were not selected before, which is known as exploration. How exploration happens has an impact on the performance of the learning process. We focus on two problems related to how a service’s adaptation actions are explored: (1) Existing solutions randomly explore adaptation actions and thus may exhibit slow learning if there are many possible adaptation actions to choose from. (2) Existing solutions are unaware of service evolution, and thus may explore new adaptation actions introduced during such evolution rather late. We propose novel exploration strategies that use feature models (from software product line engineering) to guide exploration in the presence of many adaptation actions and in the presence of service evolution. Experimental results for a self-adaptive cloud management service indicate an average speed-up of the learning process of 58.8% in the presence of many adaptation actions, and of 61.3% in the presence of service evolution. The improved learning performance in turn led to an average QoS improvement of 7.8% and 23.7% respectively

abstract = {In this rapidly changing world, business strategies continuously evolve to meet customers' wishes. Hence, the ability to cope with the frequent business changes is becoming important criteria of a leading development paradigm. Software product line engineering is a development paradigm based on reuse that builds a common platform from which a set of applications can be derived. Despite its advantage of enhancing time to market and costs, it is exposed to the risk of falling into the aging phenomenon because of the complexity of its evolution. In this paper the authors present a co-evolution based approach for protecting the software product lines from the aging phenomenon. The approach uses cladistics and trees reconciliation that are mainly used in biology to analyze the co-evolution between organisms. The authors' major goal is to find out changes of products that were not propagated to the common platform at the aim of reconsidering them in the platform and thus protecting it from being obsolete.},

abstract = {Agile methods and product line engineering (PLE) have both proven successful in increasing customer satisfaction and decreasing time to market under certain conditions. Key characteristics of agile methods are lean and highly iterative development with a strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement. PLE leverages reuse through systematic approaches such as variability modeling or product derivation. Integrating agile approaches with product line engineering is an interesting proposition which - not surprisingly - entails several challenges: Product lines (PL) rely on complex plans and models to ensure their long-term evolution while agile methods emphasize simplicity and short-term value-creation for customers. When incorporating agility in product line engineering, it is thus essential to define carefully how agile principles can support particular PLE processes. For instance, the processes of defining and setting up a product line (domain engineering) and deriving products (application engineering) differ significantly in practices and focus with implications on the suitability of agile principles. This paper presents practical experiences of adopting agile principles in product line planning (a domain engineering activity). ThinkLets, i.e., collaborative practices from the area of collaboration engineering, are the building blocks of the presented approach as they codify agile principles such as stakeholder involvement, rapid feedback, or value-based prioritization. We discuss how our approach balances agility and the intrinsic needs of product line planning. A case study carried out with an industrial partner indicates that the approach is practicable, usable, and useful.},

abstract = {Reusability is an important quality attribute for defense modeling and simulation (MS) due to the ever-changing combat simulations and new requirements. There has been research conducted worldwide for reusing simulation models. The methods proposed in these studies (including One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF)) support reuse of simulation components in the development of new models. As the reuse units in the existing methods are at the simulation component level, when existing components do not satisfy new simulation requirements, new components have to be developed and maintained separately from the existing ones. However, simulation components in the same domain tend to have common parts; behavior models for tactical missions and battlefield functions in the same domain are derived from the same tactical doctrine/manual, and thus they tend to have a common structure. There is a need for a new method to maximize reusability by providing \^{a} fine-grained\^{a} reuse, i.e. composing simulation components from reusable fine-grained modules (i.e. behaviors/functions). We address the problem by applying the product line engineering concept to the development of simulation components. Commonalities and variabilities (CVs) of domain-specific simulation requirements and CVs of tactical behaviors and battlefield functions are identified in domain-oriented variability modeling. Then, the CVs are used to design and implement domain-specific simulation component assets with domain-specific tactical behaviors and battlefield functions while embedding the identified variabilities. These domain-specific component assets are instantiated based on selections of variabilities and then integrated to develop a simulation model. Feasibility of the method was demonstrated in an infantry squad combat domain of the Republic of Korea armed forces.},

The concept of software product line engineering meets this ECS business background.

Thereafter, a strategy will be derived systematically and realize the desired benefits.This paper reports an experience with the up-front investigation performed for Hitachi's ECS. We focus on the approach to plan the migration of the existing family of individual systems into a future product line. The approach assesses potential ways of merging software from existing variants and eventually defines a procedure for performing the migration. To get a high quality strategy, we integrate the approach of software measurement, the expertise of software architects, and reverse engineering techniques.},

abstract = {Software Product Lines Engineering (SPLE) proposes techniques to model, create and improve groups of related software systems in a systematic way, with different alternatives formally expressed, e.g., as Feature Models. Selecting the ‘best’ software system(s) turns into a problem of improving the quality of selected subsets of software features (components) from feature models, or as it is widely known, Feature Configuration. When there are different independent dimensions to assess how good a software product is, the problem becomes even more challenging – it is then a multi-objective optimisation problem. Another big issue for software systems is evolution where software components change. This is common in the industry but, as far as we know, there is no algorithm designed to the particular case of multi-objective optimisation of evolving software product lines. In this paper we present MILPIBEA, a novel hybrid algorithm which combines the scalability of a genetic algorithm (IBEA) with the accuracy of a mixed-integer linear programming solver (IBM ILOG CPLEX). We also study the behaviour of our solution (MILPIBEA) in contrast with SATIBEA, a state-of-the-art algorithm in static software product lines. We demonstrate that MILPIBEA outperforms SATIBEA on average, especially for the most challenging problem instances, and that MILPIBEA is the one that continues to improve the quality of the solutions when SATIBEA stagnates (in the evolving context).},

An SPL can be extracted from one single product or from a family of related software products, and feature location strategies are widely used for variability mining. Several feature location strategies have been proposed in the literature and they usually aim to map a feature to its source code implementation. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review that identifies and characterizes existing feature location strategies. We also evaluated three different strategies based on textual information retrieval in the context of the ArgoUML-SPL feature location case study. In this evaluation, we compare the strategies based on their ability to correctly identify the source code of several features from ArgoUML-SPL ground truth. We then discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each feature location strategy.},

abstract = {A company's architecture knowledge is often personalized across specific people that share experience and knowledge in the field. However, this knowledge may be important for other stakeholders. Omitting the codification of the architecture knowledge may result in ad-hoc practices, which is particularly relevant for software evolution. In a collaboration with Egemin, an industrial manufacturer of logistic systems, we faced the problem with a lack of codified architecture knowledge in the context of the evolution of a software product line (SPL). In particular, maintainers lack the architecture knowledge that is needed to perform the evolution tasks of deployed products correctly and efficiently. Ad-hoc updates increase costs and harm the company's reputation. To address this problem, we developed an automated approach for evolving deployed systems of a SPL. Central in this approach are (1) a meta-model that codifies the architecture knowledge required to support evolution of a SPL, and (2) and algorithm that uses the architecture knowledge harvested from a deployed system based on the meta-model to generate the list of tasks maintainers have to perform to evolve the system. Evaluation of the approach demonstrates a significant improvement of the quality of system updates with respect to the correct execution of updates and the availability of services during the updates.},

This tool enables flexible integration and configuration of field tests, allowing automatic collection of data about user interactions with an application and the contexts in which it is used (metrics and indicators). The framework supports variability in both the mobile devices and the requirements of evaluators and facilitates the generation of a large set of tests. This article presents the most important aspects of the modeling, design, and implementation of the SPL for usability testing for Android applications; a case study that demonstrates the applicability of the approach; and an evaluation of the quality of the SPL in terms of modularity and reusability.},

abstract = {Product lines have been employed as a mass customisation method that reduces production costs and time-to-market. Multiple product variants are represented in a product line, however the selection of a particular configuration depends on stakeholders' functional and non-functional requirements. Methods like constraint programming and evolutionary algorithms have been used to support the configuration process. They consider a set of product requirements like resource constraints, stakeholders' preferences, and optimization objectives. Nevertheless, scalability and performance concerns start to be an issue when facing large-scale product lines and runtime environments. Thus, this paper presents a survey that analyses strengths and drawbacks of 21 approaches that support product line configuration. This survey aims to: i) evidence which product requirements are currently supported by studied methods; ii) how scalability and performance is considered in existing approaches; and iii) point out some challenges to be addressed in future research.},

However testing such highly variable software systems has proven challenging. To improve this, the goal of this doctoral research plan is to propose an automated approach to reduce the effort for testing, while improving its effectiveness. The proposed approach aims to detect code parts that have to be considered when devising a test suite by employing source code analysis and test execution monitoring, which we argue have not been used to their full potential in this context.},

Software product line engineering is a means to systematically manage variability and commonality in software systems, enabling the automated synthesis of related programs (products) from a set of reusable assets. However, the number of products in a software product line may grow exponentially with the number of features, so it is practically infeasible to quality-check each of these products in isolation. There is a number of variability-aware approaches to product-line analysis that adapt single-product analysis techniques to cope with variability in an efficient way. Such approaches can be classified along three analysis dimensions (product-based, family-based, and feature-based), but, particularly in the context of reliability analysis, there is no theory comprising both (a) a formal specification of the three dimensions and resulting analysis strategies and (b) proof that such analyses are equivalent to one another. The lack of such a theory hinders formal reasoning on the relationship between the analysis dimensions and derived analysis techniques. We formalize seven approaches to reliability analysis of product lines, including the first instance of a feature-family-product-based analysis in the literature. We prove the formalized analysis strategies to be sound with respect to the probabilistic approach to reliability analysis of a single product. Furthermore, we present a commuting diagram of intermediate analysis steps, which relates different strategies and enables the reuse of soundness proofs between them.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach for use case scenario variability management, enabling a better separation of concerns between languages used to manage variabilities and languages used to specify use case scenarios. The result is that both representations can be understood and evolved in a separate way. We achieve such a goal by modeling variability management as a crosscutting phenomenon, for the reason that artifacts such as feature models, product configurations, and configuration knowledge crosscut each other with respect to each specific SPL member. After applying our approach to different case studies, we achieved a better feature modularity and scenario cohesion.},

abstract = {ContextA common way to represent product lines is with variability modeling. Yet, there are different ways to extract and organize relevant characteristics of variability. Comprehensibility of these models and the ease of creating models are important for the efficiency of any variability management approach. ObjectiveThe goal of this paper is to investigate the comprehensibility of two common styles to organize variability into models hierarchical and constrained where the dependencies between choices are specified either through the hierarchy of the model or as cross-cutting constraints, respectively. MethodWe conducted a controlled experiment with a sample of 90 participants who were students with prior training in modeling. Each participant was provided with two variability models specified in Common Variability Language (CVL) and was asked to answer questions requiring interpretation of provided models. The models included 920 nodes and 819 edges and used the main variability elements. After answering the questions, the participants were asked to create a model based on a textual description. ResultsThe results indicate that the hierarchical modeling style was easier to comprehend from a subjective point of view, but there was also a significant interaction effect with the degree of dependency in the models, that influenced objective comprehension. With respect to model creation, we found that the use of a constrained modeling style resulted in higher correctness of variability models. ConclusionsPrior exposure to modeling style and the degree of dependency among elements in the model determine what modeling style a participant chose when creating the model from natural language descriptions. Participants tended to choose a hierarchical style for modeling situations with high dependency and a constrained style for situations with low dependency. Furthermore, the degree of dependency also influences the comprehension of the variability model.},

abstract = {Nowadays, reusing software applications encourages researchers and industrials to collaborate in order to increase software quality and to reduce software development costs. However, effective reuse is not easy and only a limited portion of reusable models actually offers effective evidence regarding their appropriateness, usability and/or effectiveness. Focusing reuse on a particular domain, such as marine ecology, allows us to narrow the scope; and along with a systematic approach such as software product line development, helps us to potentially improving reuse. From our experiences developing a subdomain-oriented software product line (SPL for the marine ecology subdomain), in this paper we describe semantic resources created for assisting this development and thus promoting systematic software reuse. The main contributions of our work are focused on the definition of a standard conceptual model for marine ecology applications together with a set of services and guides which assist the process of product derivation. The services are structured in a service taxonomy (as a specialization of the ISO 19119 std) in which we create a new set of categories and services built over a conceptual model for marine ecology applications. We also define and exemplify a set of guides for composing the services of the taxonomy in order to fulfill different functionalities of particular systems in the subdomain.

Our method has capabilities to manage feature configuration and predict energy consumption of web service systems. To validate, we developed a technique to measure energy consumption of several web service configurations running in a Virtualized environment.

Various XML-based technologies for documentation development are widely spread today, and XML-specifications appear to be a good field for formal transformations. We base our research on the DocLine technology; the main goal of which is to introduce adaptive reuse into documentation development.

abstract = {Context: Software metrics, as one form of static analyses, is a commonly used approach in software engineering in order to understand the state of a software system, in particular to identify potential areas prone to defects. Family-based techniques extract variability information from code artifacts in Software Product Lines (SPLs) to perform static analysis for all available variants. Many different types of metrics with numerous variants have been defined in literature. When counting all metrics including such variants, easily thousands of metrics can be defined. Computing all of them for large product lines can be an extremely expensive process in terms of performance and resource consumption.Objective: We address these performance and resource challenges while supporting customizable metric suites, which allow running both, single system and variability-aware code metrics.Method: In this paper, we introduce a partial parsing approach used for the efficient measurement of more than 42,000 code metric variations. The approach covers variability information and restricts parsing to the relevant parts of the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).Conclusions: This partial parsing approach is designed to cover all relevant information to compute a broad variety of variability-aware code metrics on code artifacts containing annotation-based variability, e.g., realized with C-preprocessor statements. It allows for the flexible combination of single system and variability-aware metrics, which is not supported by existing tools. This is achieved by a novel representation of partially parsed product line code artifacts, which is tailored to the computation of the metrics. Our approach consumes considerably less resources, especially when computing many metric variants in parallel.},
